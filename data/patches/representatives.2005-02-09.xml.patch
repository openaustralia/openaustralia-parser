The bill lapsed with the dissolution of the parliament. The government is reintroducing this <inline ref="R2269">bill</inline> in line with the continued commitment to the elimination of bargaining fees in industrial agreements. </para><para>This government's commitment to the principle of freedom of association is a cornerstone of a workplace relations framework that is providing for more productive and more prosperous workplaces. The Workplace Relations Act 1996 reflects the principle of freedom of association with broad legislative recognition of the freedom for employees to join, or not to join, an industrial association.</para><para>This fundamental freedom is violated by union attempts to impose so-called `bargaining agent fees'. Bargaining agent fee clauses in agreements purport to impose an obligation to pay a fee on an employee who is not a member of a union for bargaining services that they did not request. This means non-union workers have to pay for union negotiations at their workplaces even though their concerns may not be represented at all. Effectively, bargaining agent fees act as backdoor compulsory unionism. They are contrary to the principles of freedom of association and should not be included in any form of industrial instrument.</para><para>To halt the re-emergence of compulsory unionism in the federal sphere, the government introduced the Workplace Relations (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill, which was eventually passed through the Senate with support from the Australian Democrats.</para><para>The Workplace Relations (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Act 2003 amended the Workplace Relations Act and prohibited compulsory union fees in federal certified agreements. The amendments expressly provided that a bargaining services fee clause in a federal agreement is void. They also provided that a bargaining services fee clause is an `objectionable provision' for the purposes of the Workplace Relations Act. This means that an agreement should not be certified if it contains a bargaining services fee or, if an agreement has been certified, the bargaining services fee clause may be removed.</para><para>The legislative change also addressed conduct designed to compel workers to pay such fees. The compulsory union fees act prohibits the making of false or misleading representations about a person's liability to pay a compulsory fee. This was necessary to prevent unions, or employers, from using other methods to create an impression that employees are legally obliged to pay compulsory union fees.</para><para>The Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Act 2003 has been successful in addressing bargaining agents fee clauses in federal agreements with bargaining fee provisions removed from 10 certified agreements in January and February of 2004. A further 572 applications made by the Office of the Employment Advocate are currently being considered by the commission. However, as progress is made in the federal jurisdiction, a number of unions have sought to include such clauses in agreements made under state legislation. Recent cases in state jurisdictions have confirmed that bargaining agent fee clauses can be included in state agreements.</para><para>As state governments appear unwilling to prohibit compulsory bargaining fees in their jurisdictions, it again falls to the Australian government to show leadership on the issue of protecting freedom of association rights. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Extended Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2005 will extend the prohibition on the inclusion of bargaining agents' fee clauses in agreements beyond agreements certified under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to also cover any state employment agreement to which a constitutional corporation is a party. </para><para>I now turn to the main provisions of the bill. This bill will amend the freedom of association provisions to provide that a bargaining agent fee clause in a state employment agreement to which a constitutional corporation is a party is void. This will apply to agreements entered into on or after the commencement of the amendments made by this bill. The bill will also extend the prohibition on conduct related to the payment of such fees to the widest constitutional extent possible to protect employees from coercion or misleading conduct about their liability to pay such a fee.</para><para>To achieve these aims, the bill will:</para><para>	amend the definition of bargaining services to include services provided by an industrial association in relation to a state employment agreement, and</para><para>	provide that a provision of a state employment agreement to which a constitutional corporation is a party is void to the extent that it requires payment of a bargaining services fee.</para><para>Australian law recognises that there is an important statutory role for registered organisations and the law confers upon them significant rights and obligations. But the legal standing of unions should not come at the expense of individual employers' and employees' right to freedom of association and protection from coercive or discriminatory conduct.</para><para>Unions and employer associations are service providers and should rely on the competitiveness and value of the services they offer to attract members. Trade practices legislation prevents ordinary businesses from providing someone with an unrequested service and then demanding payment for it. The same principle should apply to unions and employer associations.</para><para>The government has a strong, proven commitment to freedom of association and the right of employees to choose whether or not they join a union. Bargaining agent fees are compulsory unionism by stealth and should not be included in any form of industrial instrument. The reintroduction of this bill demonstrates the Australian government's ongoing commitment to upholding employees' freedom of association rights and its willingness to act to protect those rights. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McClelland</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3</page.no><id.no>R2218</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>3</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 9 December 2004, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Abbott</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Gillard</inline> moved by way of amendment:</para><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>“while not declining to give the bill a second reading, this Parliament condemns the Government for failing to:</para><para>(1)	ensure that private health insurance provides real choice in health care;</para><para>(2)	ensure that private health insurance delivers real value for money;</para><para>(3)	adequately address the health care needs of all older Australians; and</para><para>(4)	provide modelling and data about the impact of the provisions of this bill on the cost of private health insurance for all Australians, thus necessitating the referral of this bill to a Senate committee”.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>4</page.no><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name><name.id>BV5</name.id><electorate>Lyons</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2218">Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004</inline> is another in a series of bills by which the federal government is attempting to change Medicare. It amends the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1998 and also the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. There was an election commitment made by the coalition to increase the private health insurance rebate from 30 per cent to 35 per cent for people aged 65 to 69 years and to 40 per cent for people aged 70 years and above. These rebates would be available on both hospital and ancillary cover. The higher rebates will apply to individuals who meet the age threshold and couples or families where one or more of the persons meets the age threshold. The bill makes provision for what should happen in the event of the death of an insurance holder or a family member, or divorce or separation. </para></talk.start><para>The problem is that premiums are still rising. It is no good having a system of rebates when the cost of premiums continues to rise. So all those people under 65 are virtually being told to give up their private health insurance because, in spite of the whole pile of policies supporting private health insurance, the 30 per cent rebate and lifetime cover, private health insurance premiums are on the rise. If you happen to be at the lower end of the income scale there is no way you will be able to afford the insurance and pay for all the other necessities of a working family.</para><para>The Minister for Health and Ageing knows that these costs are increasing. He has not been prepared to admit it in the past and does not really seem to care; it is part of life or death, as the case may be. Although it will help older Australians, if we had a proper Medicare system which was available to all and which was developed in the way it was originally intended, there would be no need to have all these rebates. Health care would be available equally to all those who wished for additional benefits. There could have been the option of paying through private health insurance. Yet we have a government that is propping up the private health system and that is always putting its hand out for more. No matter what it is given, it seems that it has to have more. Wouldn't it be better to put the funds that are being used to subsidise private companies into our public health system to pay for more doctors, more nurses, more health infrastructure, more dialysis machines, more equipment to help cancer patients and more general health surveys? There are millions of different health issues that would benefit if those funds were used to pay for health infrastructure.</para><para>It is only a matter of time before the advantage gained by raising private health insurance premiums will be overwhelmed by the dollar disadvantage caused by the rise. Back to square one. You hear this all the time from pensioners who have had a small amount attached to their aged pensions: `They give with one hand and take away with the other.' So in fact most pensioners and veterans are getting further and further behind in being able to afford the new Australian lifestyle.</para><para>One of the biggest groups of people coming through my electorate office is of those older Australians who are sitting on waiting lists for elective surgery. It might be elective in the terms of the medical profession but it is not seen as elective for many who wait for cataract surgery or, in severe pain, for hip replacements. Then there are many who are suffering from macular degeneration. It is an insidious disease which affects central vision and can sometimes make it difficult to read, drive or perform other activities requiring fine, detailed vision. It eventually leads to complete loss of sight. The treatment for this disease costs thousands of dollars. It means the difference between an independent, reasonable quality of life in one's own home and dependence on a nursing home or a full-care existence. Pensioners would go without the basic necessities to keep their independence and life quality, yet there is no assistance for this treatment within the public system and it is not, of course, offered under private insurance. </para><para>The reality for most elderly Australians who face health emergencies is that they rely on the public health system through the emergency departments of public hospitals. Those are the places where the most up-to-date and advanced equipment is available. Despite being covered by private insurance, the elderly end up being turned away from private hospitals because the facilities are not there and the hospitals just cannot deal with the crisis. At the other end of the argument, the more rebates there are for the elderly, the more those people who have the burden of providing the taxes to pay for the rebates will be charged. Judging by the comments that flow through my office, those people are not taking kindly to this and want to know how and when their bills might decrease.</para><para>So, will more older Australians join private health funds if the rebates are a bit more generous? Has anyone done the figures on this? Of course they have not. Why are we, the taxpayers, giving these rebates when we do not know whether they will help the system work? Who has done the figures, and where are they? I think we deserve to have some answers. The Labor Party is planning to get those answers somehow. It proposes to get some economic modelling undertaken on this legislation through a Senate legislation committee in the hope that there will be some answers before this proposal goes into law. I agree with that. I think it is important we know how much the additional funding will change the equation.</para><para>I have been trying to find some discussions on this issue and I have found that there have been quite a few journal articles recently that have taken up this topic. For instance, Stephen Duckett, Professor of Health Policy at La Trobe University, had a look at waiting times in hospitals. He tested the hypothesis that increased private activity in the health system is associated with reduced waiting times. As Tasmanians suffer some of the longest waiting times—and Professor Duckett confirms this in his paper—I was interested to see his findings. His conclusions are interesting. He finds that increased private sector activity is associated with increased public sector waiting times. He says his study does have some limitations; but, despite those, it suggests that policy makers should be cautious about pursuing policies based on expanding private access as a strategy for achieving reductions in public sector waiting times, and it correlates the findings of previous overseas studies. So those people on the additional rebate do not hold out any great hope of finding a shorter waiting list for public hospital treatment.</para><para>Another study, done by Sundararajan, Brown and others, looked at the impact of private health insurance on the utilisation of public hospitals in Australia. The study suggests that the number of patients treated in Victorian public hospitals continues to grow, with the public hospitals also tending to treat patients with more severe diseases. In their discussion those who carried out the study found that it was `not uncommon for important changes in the health sector to have unpredictable effects'. The patterns they found in this study were predicted by several analysts. So when looking at the 30 per cent rebate they found that hospitals:</para><quote><para>... continue to experience increases in the number of admitted patients as a consequence of many factors including increased efficiency, growing expectations, and demographic changes ...</para></quote><para>And that there would:</para><quote><para>... continue to be considerable unmet need and therefore, if spare capacity emerged, it would quickly be filled by those who had been in waiting (whether on formal lists or not). </para></quote><para>The paper also quoted from other works which said:</para><quote><para>... any shift to care provided under private insurance, whether in private or public hospitals, could cause a decline in the equity of care provision.</para></quote><para>The study also pointed out that although there is choice allowed under private health insurance for simple procedures or minor surgery, there is none when it comes to life-threatening illnesses. The public hospitals take the emergencies. So if we are to see any change in quality of care and waiting lists in the public sector it will not come through beefing up the private sector; it will come through funding the public sector properly.</para><para>I even looked at an article by Deb Richards in the <inline font-style="italic">Medical Observer Weekly</inline> entitled, `30% and rising—is the rebate really good policy?' She quotes a number of medicos who have been at the sharp end of financing private hospitals. Professor Harper argues that the rebate is a success because when private health insurance numbers went up the growth in public hospital expenditure stabilised. However, then Ms Richards quotes official data that shows growth in public hospital expenditures paused for a year and then continued to climb. Harper concludes that the rebate has saved the public purse much money. Not to be daunted, the reporter asks:</para><quote><para>If the private sector died, what would be the costs for the public hospitals to pick up the load?</para></quote><para>Interesting stuff. Professor Harper is quoted as finding that private hospitals perform $4.3 billion worth of procedures, when the costs of the rebate are $2.2 billion. The rebate is a `stitch in time'. The debate continues on both sides of the argument throughout the article. The OECD finding concluded that, in all the countries it has studied, private insurance provides greater choice and better access but is inflationary and leads to a two-tier system, which I believe this government is pushing this country towards. So there have been calls to subsidise private hospitals directly, rather than through the insurance funds, which absorb 13 per cent in administrative fees and pay out about 30 per cent on auxiliaries for which there is no public offset.</para><para>The general conclusion seems to be that the rebate distributes money the wrong way. It is not good health policy if you intend to get as many health services as you can for your dollar but part of those funds is being used to subsidise the activities of the private health insurance companies. All that being said, there is an argument for looking at how the financial models are working—or even whether they are working.</para><para>The public has a right to know what the answers are, and also the differences between the government's and the opposition's approaches to finding the answers. None of this has been clear during the discussions on private health funds and how they are supposed to affect the overall funding of health care in Australia. We must know whether private health insurance really does provide real choices in health care, whether it delivers real value for money and whether it adequately addresses the health care needs of all older Australians. Therefore, this bill should go to a Senate committee in order to get some of the questions answered.</para><para>Over the last three years, private health insurance premiums have risen on average by 22 per cent. As several members have said, an easier and better system might be to pay the dollars straight to the private hospitals and save some of the 13 per cent which it costs to run the private health insurance system. We need to look at the billions of dollars going into these rebates, which the government says is achieving something. Many believe that it is not and that we do not get enough for all the money that is being spent on these rebates and on what this bill does. I support the amendment. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>7</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2218">Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. I am going to say something controversial here—it is a fact that Labor do not understand health policy. There is a myth in the community, probably perpetuated by the Labor spinners themselves, that Labor are the oracle when it comes to health. They believe they have all the answers to all the problems and that only they can have the solutions. I do not believe in their publicity the way they do, and I shall explain why.</para></talk.start><para>The New South Wales health system is proof that Labor has no idea about health policy or the management of hospitals. Waiting lists are blowing out and it can take years for an older person to get a hip replacement or a knee replacement. Doctors are resigning out of frustration with management or because they cannot get the funds to perform elective surgery. At least seven doctors have resigned from the public health system in my area over the past year. Three GPs resigned from the Polyclinic at Nelson Bay because of the shifts which forced them to work a full night and back up and see patients the next day. This sort of rostering went out with ether and masks. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Newcastle Herald</inline> of 25 September 2004, four gynaecologists resigned from the John Hunter Hospital due to a lack of funding for elective surgery. I am told by one of my constituents that a heart surgeon has also resigned from the public system and for that reason he cannot get his bypass operation.</para><para>Labor has been in power in New South Wales one year longer than the Howard government has been in power, and the New South Wales health system is in an absolute shambles. While Labor has presided over the crumbling of the New South Wales health system, the Howard government has introduced a range of reforms to the health system to ensure the future of Medicare and the viability of holding private health insurance, including: the Medicare levy surcharge, the universal private health insurance rebate of 30 per cent and lifetime health cover, which encourages people to take out health insurance before they turn 30 and to keep it throughout their lives.</para><para>The changes this bill will introduce will make private health cover more affordable right at the time it should be most affordable. What Labor does not understand is that we need the private sector to be sustainable to ensure that the public sector is not swamped. To date, the shadow health minister has not fully committed to the 30 per cent rebate as it currently stands. The day Labor recognises that families, singles and couples like the rebate and appreciate that it makes it easier to afford private health cover will be the day they come out and state categorically to the Australian people about private health cover: `We're keeping it.' Until that day, we have to assume that Labor does not understand that health cover has to be affordable for people to keep it. The rebates—30 per cent for all Australians, 35 per cent for those 65 years and over and 40 per cent for those 70 years and over—help make private health cover more affordable.</para><para>When Medicare was first formed the percentage of Australians with private health insurance was around 65 per cent. When Labor established Medicare they did so on the assumption that some people would continue their private health insurance while others would need the universal free public system. Neal Blewett, the health minister who introduced the legislation to create Medicare, said at the time:</para><quote><para>Medicare provides only basic cover and they should look, if they want to do so, to the need for private health insurance and its costs. </para></quote><para>I mentioned before that four visiting gynaecologist-obstetricians resigned from John Hunter Hospital in September. One of them was quoted as saying:</para><quote><para>When you come along needing a hysterectomy, bleeding half to death every month, and haven't the money to go into a private hospital, if you see me, my next operating list is a month away.</para></quote><para>I think that if that statement says anything it is that there is a very real need for private health insurance to be affordable if the states cannot provide elective surgery. I also cannot believe that a hysterectomy is elective surgery.</para><para>Former Labor cabinet minister Graham Richardson knew that keeping people in the private health system would relieve the pressures on the public system. In 1993 Senator Richardson, the then health minister, put the proposal to cabinet that high-income earners without private health insurance be given a higher Medicare surcharge. That was knocked back because—if can you believe the self-interest at play here—the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, did not want to pay it because he was a high-income earner himself. He was a self-declared person who avoided private health insurance.</para><para>What was Labor's idea for easing the pressure on the public health system? It was Medicare Gold. Medicare Gold was a statement—nothing more. It was a statement of simplistic policy-making that tried to con the voters of Australia. It promised free health care for the over-75s. But they already have free health care in the public system. The other thing that they did not enunciate all that well was that Medicare Gold did not cover ancillaries such as physio, spectacles and dentistry. It did not give the over-75s choice of doctor or choice of health facility. It did not put in place one policy to create doctors, to ease the squeeze on hospitals or to reduce waiting lists. It was like the Medicare teams idea. Labor would create teams of doctors, out of the many thousands that we do not have surplus at the moment, to visit areas where low rates of bulk-billing are evident. Again, this was a simplistic solution that did not go into depth or even attempt to understand what the work force problems are in the health industry.</para><para>Interestingly, it was the older voters who raised Labor's Medicare Gold policy with me, saying they did not think it could work. The first question they asked was: what about the ancillaries? What about the physio they would need after the hip replacement, or the new glasses they would need in five years time? Older people know what they need. It was a shame that Labor had never thought to ask older people what they needed. I had one or two of the more selfless in the community ask me: `Why do I deserve free health care over a young mother or a sick child?' Some commented that it had shades of Whitlam about it—uncosted, unfunded and unsustainable. The other flaw in Medicare Gold was that there are no public hospitals in either of the two centres which have the greatest proportion of older constituents in my electorate. Currently, my constituents have no access to state public hospital facilities. Under Medicare Gold they would still have had no access to public hospital facilities in their area.</para><para>I noticed that none of the premiers supported the Labor plan. It was another case of announce first, consult later by the then opposition leader and his health spokeswoman. But the then opposition leader did ask the people. In a public meeting at Raymond Terrace at the beginning of the year, 200 people turned up to tell the former opposition leader what they thought, including one woman who asked what he was going to do to reduce hospital waiting lists. The former opposition leader, of course, did not have the answer then. His answer was to resign. Does the current opposition leader have any idea? I doubt it. Labor is a vacuum of new ideas and a policy black hole in our galaxy. </para><para>There are two solutions to reducing waiting lists in the public system. The first is to build more public hospitals and adequately staff them. In New South Wales, Labor continually closes wards, reduces staff and withdraws the money, particularly in regional areas like mine. The other solution is to provide incentives for people to go into private health insurance, to make that private health insurance system more affordable. As a person gets older, they are more susceptible to health problems and it is precisely as a person needs their health insurance more that we need to encourage them to maintain responsibility for their own health. This bill recognises that at 65 many Australians are not working anymore. That is precisely the time when they seek to make financial adjustments to how they live their lives. Effectively, this will mean an increase in their rebate of about $100 to $200 per annum, and that sort of saving for a person on a limited income is not to be sneezed at.</para><para>The Howard government also recognises that at 70 years of age a person is even more susceptible to health problems and may have further reduced income. Their private health insurance rebate will be increased to 40 per cent. To reduce complication only one person in a partnership needs to be over the eligible age to receive the additional rebate. Voters want choice. They want the option of going to a private hospital, getting their choice of doctor and not waiting for years for elective surgery.</para><para>Two former Labor health ministers understood the need for a dual health system with a functional private system that would keep people out of the public system. But they are gone now. The current shadow health minister, who has never 100 per cent committed to the private health insurance rebate as it stands, does not understand that those who can pay should be encouraged to do so. For those who cannot pay there is a public system that works and includes a safety net for out of hospital medical expenses, which Labor wanted to abolish.</para><para>The time has come for politicians to put aside political interests and start to think about the health care of those in our community. If the state system will not build more hospitals, employ more doctors, open more beds or provide greater health services then it is incumbent on members of this House to provide the incentives that will allow our older Australians to contribute to private health insurance to reduce the waiting lists. I ask this question of all members: is it not the goal to provide better health services and to help reduce waiting lists? This bill in part goes a long way towards that. I support this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>9</page.no><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GRIERSON</name><name.id>00AMP</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am particularly pleased to have seconded the second reading amendment to the <inline ref="R2218">Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004</inline> as proposed by the member for Lalor.

After the dismal performance in the last term of former health minister Kay Patterson the government put their Mr Fixit, Minister Abbott, in charge. True to his style, we have been given the quick fix—the grab for money and the one-off vote-buying specials. What we have not been given is long-term solutions or health policy reform. As we watch our population age, our medical work force shrink, health care and medication costs escalate and levies and premiums continue to increase and we measure this against health gains for the many billions of dollars spent, everyone in Australia knows that they have a real stake in the government getting it right. </para><para>But according to the Productivity Commission's draft research report <inline font-style="italic">Economic implications of an ageing Australia</inline> released in November last year, one-quarter of Australians will be aged 65 years or more by 2044, which is roughly double the present proportion. We know that across health services as a whole expenditure on the over-65s amounts to around four times more per person than that on those under 65, and then rises to between six and nine times more for the oldest groups in our population. As the population ages, health and aged care costs are projected to rise relative to GDP. In the absence of policy responses, the fiscal gaps opened by ageing will sum to around seven percentage points of GDP by 2044, according to the report, with an accumulated value over the 40 years of around $2,200 billion.</para><para>Actions to improve productivity and achieve more cost-effective service provision, especially in health care, are then of central importance. But on examination, this legislation does not measure up to the Productivity Commission's findings or respond to the economic implications for the health budget. The government's legislation puts into effect their election promise to increase the private health insurance rebate from 30 per cent to 35 per cent for people aged 65 to 69 and up to 40 per cent for people aged 70 years and over. If private insurance was the magic ingredient to delivering good health care, this legislation might work, but only for older Australians with enough money to buy private health insurance.</para><para>The government believe that that is the way to fix the crisis in health care—get more people into private insurance, into private hospital beds, and therefore reduce the burden on our public health system. They also claim the more people who have private insurance, the lower the premiums will become. But we know that that is not how it has worked in their term of office. Professor Stephen Duckett's study `Private care and public waiting', published in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Health Review</inline> this month, adds weight to criticisms of the Howard government's $2.5 billion annual subsidy to the private health insurance industry. This is the first Australian study to test if that 30 per cent existing private health insurance rebate is delivering for the Australian people. The study found that the government's private health insurance rebate has actually increased waiting times for treatment in public hospitals.</para><para>When the Howard government introduced the 30 per cent rebate, it argued that it would take the pressure off the public health system. However, this study directly contradicts the government's claim and backs up evidence from Britain and Canada that a higher take-up of private health insurance is associated with longer public waiting lists. In my electorate we know a little bit about that, as it affects us all personally. We are talking about family members and we are talking about neighbours and friends who await surgery at an age when damage can become quite chronic.</para><para>Professor Duckett found that a one per cent increase in the private sector proportion of funding translates into a 46-day additional wait for public patients. Contrary to claims by the AMA and Tony Abbott, Professor Duckett is not advocating that the rebate be scrapped, but rather argues the point that, if you want to take the pressure off the public sector, you need to invest in the public health sector. Unfortunately, this government's reluctance to scrutinise the impact of private health insurance rebates on the health budget and on the public delivery of health services makes any sensible debate or informed expenditure of taxpayer funds very difficult, if not impossible. </para><para>This government have tried every way it can think of to get Australians to take out private health insurance, without looking at the cost-benefits to health service delivery. They introduced the Medicare levy surcharge and lifetime health cover—measures that penalised people for failing to take up private health insurance early in their lives. At one stage, in 2000, the take-up of private health insurance increased to a high of 45.7 per cent of our population. But since then private health insurance members seem to have discovered there just was not enough benefit for what they paid, and now the take-up has reduced to 43 per cent and is dropping.</para><para>Given that over the past five years private health insurance premiums have risen by 33 per cent, about 10 per cent a year—and, dramatically, a 22 per cent increase in premiums over the past three years—it is not surprising that many people have chosen to opt out. Apparently the government thinks they need to do more to get people into private health insurance and have offered the over 65 age group some extra incentives. Research undertaken by ACOSS showed that 84 per cent of people over 65 with an income greater than $100,000 per annum do have private health insurance. But they also found that of those with incomes less than $20,000 per annum only 23 per cent choose private health insurance.</para><para>The benefit of the legislation before us will flow to those who can already afford to pay for health care costs rather than to those whose health needs are greatest. But that is the government's standard process of policy selection—survival of the wealthiest. In the health domain, one would have hoped policy would be very much linked to health needs. It is unlikely that over-65-year-olds will flock to join private health insurance to gain this additional rebate, particularly given it is only between $2 or $4 a week, and more unlikely if they are joining for the first time and they are aged between 65 and 70. Under the terms of lifetime health cover, they will be paying a lot more than the premium base rate, even with this additional rebate. I quote an elderly couple from my electorate to illustrate this point:</para><quote><para>Last year we applied to re-join a medical fund ... only to be told the % increase in the fees (2% for every year of age) made the cost prohibitive. We are age pensioners. All my working life we were in a fund ... but this does not count against the yearly ... increases in the fees.</para></quote><para>Even for those who are already in private health insurance, how long will it be before premium increases erode away that $2 to $4 a week handout? Not long, if precedent can be relied upon. Of course, private health insurance companies are looking for at least a 12 per cent increase in their premiums, and we will know the outcome of their bid very shortly. I quote from another of my constituents, who says:</para><quote><para>I am concerned about the increase in private health insurance. Despite the Federal government urging the public to take up private health insurance and assuring us that premiums would not rise—after 3 years they have increased beyond affordability.</para></quote><para>But even if older Australians do join up what will be the long-term consequence of that action? Given that currently over-65s make up 12 per cent of private health insurance membership but constitute 44 per cent of hospital benefits paid out by private health insurers, it may be anticipated that all those members who are under 65 may have to pay even higher premiums to absorb the extra costs to the private health industry. That is not fair and it is not sensible. </para><para>So what is the real picture for private health insurance for older Australians? Just over a year ago, I surveyed my electorate about private health insurance and Medicare. A staggering 1,071 Novocastrians completed the survey and, at their own cost and inconvenience, sent their responses to me. Of those, 53.4 per cent said they had private health insurance, 68.3 per cent of those with private health insurance reported that their premiums had increased and 50 per cent advised that their fund had increased the excess payable for in-hospital services. Significantly, 65 per cent did not believe that they received value for money from their private health insurer. One older constituent commented:</para><quote><para>My health fund's attitude is entirely frivolous: for instance I could not claim a refund on my walking stick, but could claim on RUNNERS!</para></quote><para>An elderly couple also commented:</para><quote><para>As pensioners, we were unable to continue Private Health Insurance, after being members of—</para></quote><para>a particular insurer in Newcastle—</para><quote><para>for approximately 20 years. We found that with increased fees, the value of service just wasn't there. Also there is no reward for being a member for so long.</para></quote><para>When asked about the `gap' that people with private health insurance were paying, 84.4 per cent of the Newcastle respondents said that this was continuing to increase. Again, there were strong feelings about this issue, linking back to the question of value for money. As one Adamstown constituent put it:</para><quote><para>There is no point joining a private health fund if when you pay the bill the gap is so expensive you can't afford it.</para></quote><para>I am assisting a constituent at the moment who has private health insurance, and her gap for surgery will be in the vicinity of $5,000. That $5,000 is an amazing gap amount for a pensioner already paying private health insurance to pay for surgical attention.</para><para>Another couple said:</para><quote><para>We are pensioners and have had severe health problems over the last 12 months. We feel we must be involved in Private health even though we found the treatment and cover falls far short of what is expected.</para></quote><para>Another constituent reported:</para><quote><para>Paying $70 for both myself and husband with only $50.70 rebate plus private insurance premiums of $132 per month, we are finding things quite hard. We are very serious about giving up private health care after 40 years.</para></quote><para>Stephen Duckett's study must be given due consideration by this government, because the reality is that, when emergency health care is needed by older Australians, it is usually provided by the public health care system in a public hospital. That is why there is overwhelming support in my electorate for strengthening Medicare and the public health system.</para><para>The opposition amendment recommends that this legislation should be tested by a Senate committee against the economic costs and benefits, the health priorities of older Australians and against the benefits of the government increasing their already massive spend on the health insurance rebate. That is the least this parliament could do. Of course, had a Labor government been elected, we would have done a lot more for the health care of all older Australians, a lot more towards reforming the health system in this country and a lot more to find cost-effective ways to manage the health budget. We would have been speaking today on legislation to put into effect Labor's Medicare Gold policy, a policy that was so inspired and creative, so lateral in its extent of operation and so responsive to the real needs of older Australians that it was a serious threat to the Treasurer and the health minister. You can actually measure the strength of Medicare Gold by the intensity of the attack the government has launched against it. </para><para>Medicare Gold reeks of reform—something this government knows very little about—with specific benefits to older Australians and diverse cost benefits for all Australians. Although Medicare Gold targeted the over-75 population, it had potential for flow-on effects right across the health sector. Medicare Gold would have seen the up to 25 per cent spare capacity in private hospitals instantly put to use to respond to the health needs of patients over 75. What country can afford to have expensive hospital beds unused while people wait on growing lists for surgery in public hospitals? Medicare Gold promised that government would meet the costs of health care for over-75s, whether in private or public hospitals, taking out of the equation the ineffective and wasteful cost shifting across the state and federal divide and eliminating the need for people over 75 to pay private health insurance premiums for hospital care.</para><para>Why would that be feared so much? With government as a monopoly buyer for that age group's health care needs, it could have been anticipated that charges may have reduced as demand increased. Market economics would suggest that private hospital management could lower their charges—and we have seen recently that charges are excessive in private hospitals due to the use of the most expensive procedures and equipment. If Medicare Gold had been introduced, there would have been some certainty of demand, allowing cuts to administration and personnel costs. They would also have had maximum occupancy rates, and, surely with demand levels constantly high, cash flows would have been assured. As the monopoly buyer of a large share of the private hospital market, government then would have been able to influence costs and charges and quality of service delivery within the private hospital system. I think we all accept that under this government health services will be delivered more and more by the private sector, but we also accept that service delivery has to value add to everything that we want—the best that we want—in health care. That sounds like the mutual obligation I would like to see operate in the delivery of health services by the private sector.</para><para>It might also have been anticipated that moving people over 75 into private hospitals' unused beds would have allowed the public hospitals to reduce their waiting lists and eventually ensure that older Australians had access to operations at the time of onset of a medical condition, rather than after considerable debilitation, with the consequential burdens of loss of independence and mobility, and the increased draw on home care and support services. If those over 75 could have those operations in a more timely way, those human and economic costs would be reduced, alleviating the terrible burden on our aged parents and loved ones that we currently experience. That makes an increase in the health insurance rebate look miserable, doesn't it? Well, it is miserable. It is small minded, limited, regressive and just plain poor policy.</para><para>Medicare Gold would also have reduced the burden on private health insurers by eliminating the cost burden to private health insurers generated by members over 75 years old. By eliminating the customer group that actually costs the most, private health insurers could then have been free to be more creative with their products and services; to build in some incentives for young people to take out insurance and manage their health care at an early stage; and to build in some bonuses for preventative health care. Private health insurers could have become key players in the important work of averting a national health crisis from unchecked diabetes, dementia and the illnesses besetting a rapidly ageing population. Shouldn't the private sector also have a responsibility to help this nation tackle the health priorities as well as gain revenue rewards? </para><para>It seems to me that private systems can work well to create profit, but they work best when social dividend is also part of their charter and their bottom line of outcomes. My knowledge of the board members of NIB, the largest private health insurer in my electorate of Newcastle, suggests that they really wish to continue the ethos under which NIB began—that is, BHP workers, originally, banding together and contributing financially to gain the best health benefits for their community.</para><para>But, regrettably, we are not legislating to introduce Medicare Gold. Instead, we are scrutinising the government's legislation—legislation that risks rising private health insurance premiums for everyone, risks further increasing copayments for pharmaceuticals and risks stagnation of waiting lists in public hospitals for Australians of every age group, but particularly for older Australians. With the cost of the rebate already approaching $2.5 billion, this legislation also risks a blow-out in the health budget necessitating the government's favourite intervention of raising more hidden taxes, taxes like the Medicare levy and perhaps even an increase in the GST to fund the ever-increasing health needs of an ageing population. That is why the member for Lalor's amendment seeks to have this legislation scrutinised by a Senate committee.</para><para>Despite the strong need for the government to respond to our ageing population and to manage their health needs efficiently and effectively, and contrary to the Howard government's claim, this legislation is unlikely to encourage people aged 65 to 70 years who do not currently have private health insurance to take it out, as they would still be subject to the maximum lifetime health cover penalty of 70 per cent. Age pensioners like those quoted above are unlikely to re-enter private health insurance, but those who are currently able to afford it, such as those on incomes over $100,000, will receive a short-term gain—and all for a gain by the Howard government of three more years in power.</para><para>Contrary to the government's claim that private health insurance reform is all about choice, efficiency and delivering better value for money, there is nothing in this bill to ensure that any of these objectives are met. The one certainty Australian families can expect is yet another substantial increase in private health insurance premiums, and that will occur very soon.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>14</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2218">Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004</inline> increases the rebate for private health insurance from 30 to 35 per cent for people aged 65 to 69 and to 40 per cent for those aged over 70. Labor is not opposing this legislation. We do want a Senate inquiry to assess its impacts, because the claims that the government has made about this policy are mere assertion, and there is certainly value in testing those assertions. There is already rising evidence to suggest that the assertions that the government has made are not soundly based.</para></talk.start><para>The reality is that these increases in the private health insurance rebate are more likely to benefit those on higher incomes because the private health insurance rebate is accessed by those on higher incomes to a much greater extent than it is by those on lower incomes. One piece of evidence has been gathered by ACOSS, the Australian Council of Social Service, which has published survey data indicating that 84 per cent of those aged over 65 who have incomes over $100,000 are covered by the private health insurance rebate, but only 23 per cent of people with an income below $20,000 are covered by the private health insurance rebate. Whether or not those figures are absolutely accurate, the point remains that there is at least some evidence which coincides with intuitive reasoning that the private health insurance rebate is accessed and used more by older Australians on higher incomes than by those on lower incomes and therefore that the increase in the rebate to 35 per cent for one category of older Australians and 40 per cent for another is going to benefit those on higher incomes much more than those on lower incomes. </para><para>We should not be surprised about that. After all, this is a Liberal-National Party government, and it is its philosophic preference to reward those who are up the income scale and not to reward those who strive hard all their lives but end up without large incomes. Indeed, we saw that with the tax policy released by the coalition, where the forgotten people, those below $52,000 a year, got not one cent of income tax reduction, but those above $52,000 a year got a fairly reasonable income tax cut. So this legislation and the philosophy behind it really mirror the tax legislation that was announced in the budget and passed through this parliament late last year—that is, a system that benefits those on higher incomes more than those on lower incomes. I do not mind the idea of benefiting people on higher incomes—I do not think we should be into class envy—but why do the people on lower incomes always miss out under this government? Indeed, the legislation will reward those who can afford to purchase private health insurance, and of course it offers absolutely nothing to those who cannot afford to purchase it. As I say, they are overwhelmingly people over 65 who are just not in a situation to be able to buy private health insurance.</para><para>One of the great concerns is how long any benefit from this increase in the private health insurance rebate will last. Sadly, it is likely to be not very long at all. Based on past premium increases, it is quite likely that, within a period of one to two years, premium increases will gobble up any benefits to those who take out private health insurance. I say that because over the past three years private health insurance premiums have risen by a staggering 22 per cent and over the past five years they have risen by around 33 per cent. At those rates, any benefit that did flow to holders of private health insurance would be gone within two years as the private health insurance industry appropriated the financial gains that have been offered by the government. To those who receive the private health insurance rebate, I say, `Be happy for a short period of time, until the health minister does what he has always done as health minister: rubber-stamp premium increases.' On that form, we will see those premium increases coming forward pretty quickly, wiping out the benefits within two years.</para><para>It reminds me of a statement about our health system that the Prime Minister made fairly recently. It has been pretty clear throughout his performance over the last 25 to 30 years that he wants to return to the pre-Whitlam health system. That is not my assertion; it is what the Prime Minister has said. In 2003, on <inline font-style="italic">A Current Affair</inline>, he said to Ray Martin that he liked the system that was in place before the Whitlam Labor government was elected. He said that the election of the Labor government destroyed a system that he thought was pretty good. Without going into ancient history, let us just discuss some of the characteristics of the system that was in place before 1972. One of the defining characteristics was the large number of people who were not covered by health insurance at all. You would think that in an advanced country a fundamental obligation of any government is to ensure quality health care for all its citizens, yet large numbers of Australians had no private health insurance at all because they could not afford it. Often hospitals were benevolent and did not kick them out, but people who had no insurance and no capacity to pay did not have reasonable access to hospital and tended to be forced to the back of the queue. To my mind, that is not the definition of a decent health care system that provides quality health care for all. </para><para>When the Prime Minister was Treasurer in the Fraser government, they systematically dismantled Medibank. The Fraser government had seven different health systems in seven years. By the end of that period, upon the election of the Hawke government, two million Australians had no health insurance. With the introduction of Medicare, a revamped version of Medibank, all Australians were covered in one decisive initiative: they had their health costs insured through Medicare. That was a great reform. Sadly this government gives lip service to the maintenance of Medicare, when in fact the overwhelming desire of the Prime Minister is to dismantle Medicare by stealth and to favour the private system. This legislation is further evidence of that.</para><para>Before government ministers suggest that I am saying we should abolish the private health insurance rebate, I am not. The government has a mandate for this legislation, and that is why Labor will allow it to pass. But I note that there has been a lot of criticism of Medicare Gold by the Treasurer. He says that the problem with Medicare Gold is that we have this massive challenge—the ageing of the population—and that to provide free health cover for those over the age of 75 is unaffordable. Isn't it strange that when Labor wanted to do it the Treasurer and the Prime Minister said that it was irresponsible to provide older Australians with extra health benefits that would cost the budget a lot, but when the coalition does it it is entirely affordable. That seems to be the argument. I think we need to be careful about committing to expenditures that will only compound dramatically over the next 40 years with the ageing of the population.</para><para>I think some of the criticism of Medicare Gold is valid, and Labor is now looking at a Medicare Gold type of policy. One of the strongest features of a Medicare Gold type of policy is that it would remove the cost shifting that goes on between the Commonwealth and the states. I think that is a very great strength of a Medicare Gold type of policy. But the Treasurer cannot have it both ways. He cannot say on the one hand that it is irresponsible to load up the budget with increased costs for the health of older Australians via Medicare Gold but that it is all right to load up the budget with increased health costs from lifting the private health insurance rebate to 35 per cent and 40 per cent.</para><para>I have done some calculations on this. Based on the budget forecasts, the private health insurance rebate increase for older Australians is likely to cost in the order of $150 million in 2007-08, on current prices. But, when you add that to a number of other initiatives that this government has taken over the last few years, it certainly is arguable that the government itself is not responding properly to the ageing of the population, because other measures have also been taken that will compound dramatically over time as the number of older Australians increases. To give some perspective on that, the population projections conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics suggest that in 40 years time there will be four million more Australians over the age of 65 but 200,000 fewer children. There will be only one million more Australians aged 15 to 55 and another million aged 55 to 65. What does that mean? It means a massive ageing of the population—four million more Australians over the age of 65. </para><para>The whole <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report </inline>was prepared because Treasury was concerned about the ageing of the population and, in particular, the health costs of the ageing population to the budget. Treasury concentrated on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, but that is but one component of compounding costs associated with the ageing of the population. There are other components as a result of the decisions taken by this government over the last five years. We have already identified the increase in the private health insurance rebate. What about the seniors concession allowance for self-funded retirees who hold a Commonwealth seniors card? That is likely to cost another $70 million in 2007-08. The reduction in tax—that is, the lifting of the effective tax-free threshold for those over the age of 65—is expected to cost around $300 million in 2007-08. Also, an exemption of superannuation from social security means tests for those over 55 is likely to be in the order of $90 million, and a telephone allowance for seniors healthcare card holders is rather small at $25 million. I also need to add in here that the superannuation surcharge reduction is expected to cost in the order of $385 million in 2007-08. If you add all of those up you get more than $1 billion.</para><para>In some respects $1 billion may not seem to be a massive amount of money, but it is $1 billion for those who are senior citizens in this country in 2007-08. If you believe the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline>, the ABS population projections, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister that there is a massive problem of the ageing of the population, then these costs will compound dramatically over the next 40 years. It is passing strange that the Treasurer criticises Medicare Gold on the basis that it is unaffordable but when the government implements measures that load up costs for older Australians where those costs will compound dramatically over 40 years, it seems to be saying that it is entirely affordable. A light needs to be shone on the commitment by the government to such expenditures. I know government ministers would like to say that I am therefore opposing all these measures. I am not opposing these measures; I am not suggesting that they be reversed.</para><para>It is quite hypocritical of this government to criticise any Labor policy to improve the health and wellbeing of older Australians as being unaffordable, but, when it does it—and it is usually directed towards the private system—then apparently that is completely affordable. The reality of these increases is that the government wants to keep the private health insurance industry happy, because the private health insurance industry and its spokespeople are great supporters of the Howard government. That is the political equation. But let us go beyond the political equation and look at some of the economic dimensions of these sorts of policies.</para><para>The legislation we are debating here today contains costs which are part of a $66 billion spending spree undertaken by this government since the last budget and through the election campaign to secure its re-election. Over four years $66 billion has been committed by this government, not necessarily to improve the welfare of Australians and certainly not to invest in the nation's future because, of that $66 billion, as little as $5 billion can be identified as genuine investment in the nation's future, the remainder being effectively consumption spending. Late last year I expressed concerns in the address-in-reply to the Governor-General's speech on 17 November about the practice of the government of engaging in a consumption spending spree when Australian consumer spending was already very high. I know it is a little unusual to quote yourself in a speech but I thought I would draw some parallels between this, what I said late last year, and the <inline font-style="italic">Statement on Monetary Policy</inline> released two days ago by the Reserve Bank. I said, in part: </para><quote><para>Australia's consumption boom has been fuelling domestic inflation. A four per cent increase in prices of non-tradables over the last 12 months has been disguised by a reduction in the Australian dollar value of tradables, keeping the overall inflation rate within the Reserve Bank's target range. The IMF, in its report last week, identified these inflationary pressures and warned that the dampening effect of inflation from tradable goods may be eroding owing to the recent easing of the Australian dollar.</para></quote><para>I went on to say:</para><quote><para>Employment figures released on 11 November indicate a tight job market, pointing to another possible source of pressure—wage inflation fuelling domestic price inflation—and, despite the slowing of the housing market, consumer confidence seems to be going from strength to strength.</para></quote><para>I warned:</para><quote><para>There is a whiff of the late 1980s about the present consumption boom. Consumers are behaving as if nothing will stop them from continuing on their merry spending way. If consumers do pull back in the new year, in response to falling housing prices, there will be an economic slowdown. If they do not, as seems more likely at present, the Reserve Bank will be forced to hike interest rates, causing a sharper slowdown.</para></quote><para>I asked:</para><quote><para>Where is the Howard government in all this?</para></quote><para>I said:</para><quote><para>... the government is spending on consumption, fuelling the consumption flames. To avert damaging interest rate rises, the federal government should have been reining in Commonwealth spending instead of engaging in this consumption spending spree. The longer it waits before displaying some fiscal responsibility, the harder the landing will be.</para></quote><para>The Reserve Bank <inline font-style="italic">Statement on Monetary Policy</inline>, released two days ago, says this, in part:</para><quote><para>Most economic data in Australia have continued to suggest strong conditions recently.</para></quote><para>The monetary policy talks about the performance of the labour market and consumer confidence being close to record levels. It states:</para><quote><para>... the range of other available information suggests that the economy was in a strong condition through last year and is likely to have maintained a good pace of growth entering 2005.</para></quote><para>It talks of capacity constraints becoming more important and of the disappointing performance of our exports to date, which I did mention in my speech last year. It states:</para><quote><para>For the past couple of years, underlying inflation has been held down by the lagged effects of the exchange rate appreciation that took place during 2002 and 2003, but the maximum impact from that source has now passed. Hence it is likely that underlying inflation has now reached its low point and that it will start rising during 2005. Domestically-sourced inflation has been running faster over the past couple of years ...</para></quote><para>And so it goes on. I have to say that there are pretty striking similarities between what I said last year and what the Reserve Bank said two days ago, in trying to warn of the consequences of the spending spree that this government has engaged in. Yet what did the Treasurer say at the end of last year? On the last day of parliament he said:</para><quote><para>I hope ... that we will have a good retailing season this Christmas.</para></quote><para>So we have the Treasurer saying: `Spend away! Go for your life!' And why wouldn't the Treasurer be saying that, because the government is going for its life with a $66 billion spending spree. There is a consumption boom in this country and now the Reserve Bank is finally warning that, as a consequence of it, it may have to raise interest rates because the government will not act. Enough of the government's hypocrisy on health policy; enough of the government's hypocrisy on economic policy. The government is asleep at the wheel. It should wake up and start managing this economy. Otherwise, we will be in for a hard landing. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>19</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In summing up the <inline ref="R2218">Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004</inline> and closing the second reading debate, I wish to thank all members who have participated.

We cannot have a strong and viable Medicare system without a strong and viable private health care sector as well.

If the private hospital system were, for whatever reason, unable to continue, we would immediately have far greater problems in our public hospital system than we currently have. Without a strong private sector we cannot have a strong public sector, and we cannot have a strong private sector without a strong and viable system of private health insurance. The private sector in health rests upon private health insurance, and that is why this government has always been determined to try to ensure the continuing strength of the private health insurance industry.</para><para>The government has considerable achievements to its credit. Back in the mid- to late-nineties private health insurance coverage had dropped to about 30 per cent of the population. Today, thanks to Lifetime Health Cover and the private health insurance rebate, private health insurance coverage is about 43 per cent of the population. Some nine million Australians have private health insurance cover, including one million Australians with incomes of less than $20,000 a year. Most of those low-income Australians with private health insurance are older people, and most of those older people have had their private health insurance for many years. Their private health insurance predates Lifetime Health Cover and it predates the private health insurance rebate. They have paid and paid for their private health insurance cover and, in so doing, they have helped to bear the burden of the health costs of all Australians over the years. The government believes it is right and proper that those people should have a modest but significant additional incentive to maintain their private health insurance cover. The last thing we would want is for older people, at precisely the time in their lives when they are most likely to need additional medical attention, to drop their private health insurance cover because they are finding the financial burden prohibitive. This bill will provide, thanks to the 35 per cent and 40 per cent private health insurance measures for people over 65 and over 70, a benefit of $100 or $200, on average, to these people. Perhaps it will lead to some modest increases in private health insurance cover for older people, but certainly it should help to ensure that older people do not drop out of their private health insurance cover.</para><para>I want to thank members opposite for the indication that the ALP will not oppose this legislation. I think that is an indication that members opposite have learnt something from recent political history. I think members opposite have learnt that people want to be able to have that little bit of additional control over their lives that private health insurance brings. There are still some confusing signs coming from members opposite; there are still some signs of ideological confusion from members opposite. Are they or are they not committed to the Medicare Gold policy? Will they or will they not really embrace the private health sector as a positive good, rather than as a necessary evil? I think that shades of the former Leader of the Opposition still inhabit members opposite. I think the ghost of Mark Latham still haunts this debate. As you will remember, the former member for Werriwa did say of the private health insurance rebate that it was the `maddest piece of public policy' ever to come out of this parliament. But members opposite are starting to move on, and that is to their credit. I am pleased that they are getting over it. Nevertheless, I think there is still some way to go. </para><para>One of the issues that has arisen since this policy was announced in consultation with the private health insurance sector is what might happen to people who are not over 65 but who are currently covered by a policy which includes someone who is over 65 and therefore attracts the higher rebate. I want to make it very clear that the government's intention is that nobody should be kicked off their cover as a result of this legislation. It is possible that these new arrangements will need finetuning after practical experience of their operation. The government will monitor the implementation of the seniors' rebate, review its operation after the first six to 12 months and, if necessary, make any legislative finetuning that is desirable.</para><para>This is an important piece of legislation. It will significantly strengthen the private health sector in this country. I am pleased that it is not going to be opposed by the opposition. I commend it to the House, and I think that older Australians can be confident that their future, their health security, is in good hands with the Howard government.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time.

It is interesting that the bill that I will be speaking on is the <inline ref="R2161">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Adjustment of Certain FTB Child Rates) Bill 2004</inline>, obviously something of interest to all of those who have families.</para></talk.start><para>At the outset I can indicate that Labor do support the passage of this bill, but we do note that this bill has only been necessary to correct the flaws in the indexation provisions of the Family Assistance Act 1999 that arose as a result of changes made under the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—Increased Payments) Bill 2004, which introduced the $600 per child family tax benefit supplement. Labor said from the start that the government had either made a major blunder or sneakily changed the formula for calculating fortnightly family tax benefit A payments so that it could recover or claw back the value of the per child supplement over time. The Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Patterson, and her former colleague Larry Anthony responded by claiming that the government was fully committed to maintaining the real value of the per child supplement over time. But neither Senator Patterson nor Mr Anthony ever addressed Labor's key charge that the government had deceived families by fiddling with the formula for the fortnightly FTBA payments when it introduced the per child supplement in the 2004 budget. </para><para>After two months of insisting that there was no problem, Senator Patterson belatedly conceded in August last year that she and Mr Anthony had botched the original legislation and that it needed to be changed yet again. So here we are. Senator Patterson then of course broke her promise to fix the problem before the federal election. The government finally introduced this bill into the House on 18 November, six months after it created the mess in the budget legislation. Debate on the bill was then delayed until this session, well after Senator Patterson's promise to correct the problem once and for all.</para><para>The bill itself, as members of the House might be able to tell, even from that brief history of it, is a technical bill. It seeks to adjust the indexation provisions of the Family Assistance Act 1999 so that the detrimental impact of changes made by the government as part of its 2004 More help for Families legislation is reversed. The bill amends the family tax benefit adjustment provisions in schedule 4 of the Family Assistance Act 1999 that apply in relation to the family tax benefit A under-13 and age 13-15 child rates. Under the new arrangements provided for in the bill if the FTBA under 13 child rate, as indexed by the consumer price index, is less than the amount worked out using the formula of the combined pensioner rate times 16.6 per cent—where the combined pensioner rate refers to combined pensioner couple—then the FTBA under-13 rate is increased to the amount determined under the formula. The position is the same for the family tax benefit A age 13-15 child rate, except that the multiplier is 21.6 per cent. Collectively these tests are more simply known as the safety net benchmark provisions. These provisions had been introduced by previous Labor governments to ensure adequacy of fortnightly payments to Australian families. The arrangements provided for in this bill are the same as those which applied to FTB payments prior to the passage of the budget legislation last year. The bill does not make any changes to the future indexation arrangements for the supplementary FTB payment, which will continue to be adjusted by the CPI.</para><para>Since the per child supplement was introduced, Labor has pointed out that the effect of other changes made in that same legislation was that the supplementary payment would be fully recovered or clawed back by the government over time. This was because changes in the budget legislation to the formula for calculating fortnightly FTBA payments compromised the existing safety net benchmark and the value of the per child supplement would be eroded within a five- to seven-year period. This position was supported by the Australian Council of Social Service, which noted in its press release on 21 June 2004:</para><quote><para>... the new indexation rules will see Family Tax Benefit rise more slowly than it would have under current rules. The value of the $600 increase will be washed away </para></quote><para>The safety net benchmarks which were introduced by Labor and carried over in the Family Assistance Act 1999 have not influenced FTB payments recently because those payments have been well above the benchmarks since the FTB system was introduced. However, this will change in the future when the benchmarks catch up with FTB fortnightly payments.</para><para>The effect will be that the fortnightly FTBA payments will then start to increase at a lower rate than would have been the case prior to the changes to the formula that were made in last year's budget legislation. Labor argued that, after five to seven years, the value of the foregone increase in FTBA payments would have been greater than the value of the supplementary payment to families. So the government would have clawed back the value of the supplementary payment by reducing the normal fortnightly payments. As I have said, despite denials at the time from Senator Patterson and former junior minister Larry Anthony, the changes made when the supplementary payment was introduced did alter the formulas used to calculate the benchmarks.</para><para>Under sections 6 and 7 of schedule 1 of the budget legislation, while 16.6 per cent or 21.6 per cent of the annualised combined partnered pension rate was still calculated, the result of that calculation was reduced by the FTB supplement. These new formulas therefore resulted in lower benchmarks. While the lower benchmarks would still increase in line with movements in male total average weekly earnings, they would take longer to rise to match the CPI indexed FTBA rate. It would only be at that time that the benchmarks started to influence the FTBA rate. So the new benchmarks, which are lower than before because the supplementary payment is deducted, would eventually produce lower rates of FTBA than the original benchmarks. Hence Labor's claim, supported by ACOSS, that the effective value of the $600 supplement would be eroded over time by this detrimental change to the formula for calculating fortnightly FTBA payments. Obviously Australian families were going to miss out.</para><para>Eventually, on 4 August 2004, two months after the flaw in her legislation was exposed, Senator Patterson rather ungraciously conceded the need for legislative amendments to ensure the maintenance of the full value of the supplementary payment into the future. It has taken a further six months for the government to bring on the debate about this bill. It has only been through Labor's persistence that the government has belatedly acknowledged the need to make the changes contained in this bill—and we are pleased that Australian families will reap the benefits of our persistence. However, as late as 17 November last year Senator Patterson was still criticising Labor for daring to find fault with the budget legislation, rather than owning up to her own failure to ensure that Australian families were not made worse off over the long term by the legislation.</para><para>Senator Patterson has continued to try and hide behind what she said was an unintentional change to the safety net benchmark provisions. She cannot bring herself to acknowledge the blunder that she alone has made. If the change really was unintentional, we are at a loss to understand why Senator Patterson took so long to admit that the provisions needed changing. Senator Patterson also criticises Labor for what she describes as `scaremongering' about the problem that she created through her own faulty legislation to introduce the supplementary FTB payment. But if Labor had not raised the problem, we would not be debating this bill today, because Senator Patterson would never have admitted to her mistakes and would never have sought to fix the problem—and Australian families would have been the losers. Senator Patterson should actually stand up in the Senate when this legislation is debated there and acknowledge that if Labor had not identified and exposed this blunder Australian families would have been the losers. </para><para>If the government had continued to ignore Labor's concerns then the value of the supplementary payment would have been washed away through the dodgy change to the formula for calculating fortnightly FTBA payments that Senator Patterson included in the budget legislation. Labor's main concern through this whole debate has been to ensure that Australian families who are eligible for the per child supplementary payment are not duped by the government once again. Consistent with the decision by Labor in government to introduce the safety net benchmarks in the first place, Labor now want to ensure that the integrity of the system is maintained, and that it is not undermined by mistakes or backdoor attempts to erode the value of other payments that are made to Australian families. This is why Labor are pleased to finally support the passage of this bill through the House of Representatives today. We hope that it gets quick passage through the Senate and that Australian families will be better off as a result. We note that now is the time for Senator Patterson to admit to her mistakes and move on for the future settling of appropriate payments to Australian families. I thank the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>23</page.no><name role="metadata">Richardson, Kym, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RICHARDSON</name><name.id>E0B</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the <inline ref="R2161">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Adjustment of Certain FTB Child Rates) Bill 2004</inline>. The purpose of this bill is to ensure that the real value of fortnightly payments of the family tax benefit part A is maintained in the future. This bill is essential in guaranteeing that the real impact of these payments to families is not lost, by ensuring that fortnightly payments of the family tax benefit part A will be indexed to either the CPI or a percentage of the combined pensioner couple rate. This government is dedicated to ensuring that families are better off under the Howard government and are not disadvantaged following the 2004 budget. With that aim in mind, this bill ensures that fortnightly rates of payment will be adjusted at the same time and for the same amount as would have occurred before the budget.</para></talk.start><para>As part of this government's budget initiatives, legislation was passed providing an additional ongoing supplement of $600 per child. My colleagues from across the floor have continually stated that this $600 increase would evaporate over time and would not provide any real benefit to families. I would like to take this opportunity to clarify what is obviously a misconception held by the opposition. At the time the legislation providing for the $600 supplement was passed, provision was included which ensured that the supplement would be indexed each year in accordance with increases in CPI. That legislation, like the bill I speak in support of today, was aimed at providing real and genuine support to families. Together they do so, by ensuring that the funding initiatives put in place by this government are not eroded by increases in the cost of living. Not only are families better off under the Howard government but, on average, Australian families now receive $7,000 in family tax benefit.</para><para>The successful passage of this bill provides a guarantee to Australian families that the real value of their family assistance will be maintained. I am heartened to see in the recent policy principles document released by the Labor Party that they are finally willing to recognise the significant benefit the $600 per child payment has provided to Australian families. I trust, therefore, that we will hear no further claims coming from the opposition that this payment and the benefit it provides to families is not a real one. </para><para>The cost of the amendments contained in this bill will be $25.9 million from 2006 to 2008. There is no doubt that funding initiatives like this are only possible because of the responsible economic management provided by the Howard government. This government has worked tirelessly to ensure that its strong economic and financial management provides genuine assistance to Australians who need it, while at the same time providing the best possible foundation for future generations of Australians. This bill is aimed directly at achieving both those vitally important goals by providing funding to families while aiming that funding directly at the children who are Australia's future. In conclusion, I am pleased to be able to support this bill and I commend this bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>24</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2161">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Adjustment of Certain FTB Child Rates) Bill 2004</inline> that the government has before the House will be supported by the opposition. We have heard in this debate some excellent arguments on both sides of the House on this particular matter of health. We on this side of the House have a very long history of involvement in this particular area. Labor was the architect of the great universal public health scheme that gives every Australian, by right, access to quality health care in this country. Sadly, under conservative governments down through the eons the public health system has been run down—and the Howard government is no exception in that respect. Yes, we do see a place for private health insurance in the provision of health care for Australians, but it ought not to be at the expense of the public health system in this country.</para></talk.start><para>I will not speak for too long on this particular bill because many of the arguments that I would make in this debate have been covered by other speakers and no doubt will be covered by the member for Gorton when he enters the debate. But, suffice to say, on the issue of health care Labor has form both in government and in opposition. We have seen the chaos created in the past by conservative governments in power. On this occasion we do intend to support this particular measure, but I think the Australian electorate has it right: Labor in government and in opposition has always put the health of Australians front and square in the policies that it has put before them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>24</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Gorton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the member for Corio for foreshadowing some of the comments I wish to make. It is true that we support the <inline ref="R2161">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Adjustment of Certain FTB Child Rates) Bill 2004</inline>, but of course this bill should not have had to happen. I think it is an example of law made on the run. As we know, the government, in its efforts to buy votes at the last election, decided to create some policy or law in an attempt to bribe Australian voters. There are all sorts of questions about the way in which we should dispense the contents of the public purse in order to look after people in need. Indeed, the whole area of family tax benefits is open to question as to the best way to do that. But I do not think it is the case that the government thought through clearly the implications of its initial act announced in the budget last year by the Treasurer.</para></talk.start><para>I am aware that the Treasurer was initially against the $600 payment and lost in cabinet. We are very well aware that he saw that it might be perceived as an attempt to buy votes at the next election. I also think we should be aware that the $600 bonus was indeed welcomed by households, because of course any money that provides relief to families in need will be welcomed by the community. There is no doubt that, because the money was announced in a rushed manner and because it was not foreseeable by the recipients of that $600 bonus—or, indeed, more than $600, depending upon how many children there were in each household that was eligible for the payment—it came as a great surprise. I am very confident that it was welcomed by people in need, as I said. </para><para>But I do not think that is going to be the case with future payments, because what the government has effectively done is to foreshadow that you can now expect to receive $600, $1,200 or $1,800 at the end of the financial year. You will be able to calculate that sum and then plan for it. Compared with what has occurred to date, where most recipients received a sum of money which they had not planned for and therefore they welcomed it—they had not spent it or factored it into their household budget, because it was not something that they knew about until the Treasurer announced it last year—we are now going to be in a situation where the families that are eligible for the payment will be factoring in the payment well in advance of receiving it.</para><para>The problem of reconciliation, however, is not resolved. That is the one thing we have to really be clear about. The issue of reconciling whether there is a surplus or debt for those recipients eligible for family tax benefits is not resolved by providing lump sums a year down the path. As we know, you have to calculate your own income 12 months in advance. If you are lucky enough to have calculated that sum of income for the household very well, you are not going to be in debt. But, as we know, approximately one-third of recipients of family tax benefits had some form of debt. Indeed, the average debt was in excess of $600.</para><para>It is true to say that, if you did not foresee $600 being received at the end of year and then you received it, it would be some relief. If you are going to be in debt in excess of $600, $600 or more is going to help relieve the amount of debt. However, as I say, the difference now, as opposed to last year, is that families now in receipt of such moneys will be calculating that into their budget. It says to me that we do not yet have a fix. We do not have an answer as to how to work out the reconciliation of one's income and eligible family tax benefit. That is the conundrum that most households find themselves in. Now, because they foresee the $600 or more in their household income, it seems to me that they will already be spending that—or be happy to go further into debt because they will be in receipt of it. But that does not remove the fact that a huge proportion of families were in debt at the end of the financial year because of the system that we operate.</para><para>There is also a question of good public policy about providing lump sums. There is no doubt that for many households money amounting to $600 extra would be welcomed or that in some instances it would be the largest amount of money they would see in any given year. I understand why people would want to be in receipt of such sums. But, as decision makers, in dispensing the public purse, we have to consider whether the lump sum payment at the end of the year is the best way to look after children in this country, to provide for them and to assist in the provision of services for them. From looking at the policy and talking to families about the way they tend to budget in the household, the conclusion I have drawn is that it is not the best policy. It might be the best incentive to vote for the government that provides the money, but it is not the best policy for the country for looking after children. There is a whole debate to be had about the way in which the family tax benefit should be paid. </para><para>This bill is a cautionary bill. It was introduced into the House because the government was rushing its law. It was rushing its policy; it was forcing through a law; and in Senate estimates it found that it had a flawed act. It had to introduce this bill, which we support, in order to rectify the deficiencies in the preceding bill relating to this matter. We know that this is a bandaid to fix a problem. As I say, I do not think the initial bill fundamentally alters the problem of reconciliation that occurs in the system. I accept that we need to support this bill, but there would have been no need for it if there had been proper and decent consideration of the matters involved rather than rushing to pay out large sums of money before a federal election. If it were not for that, we would not have this bill. I say it is a cautionary bill because we know that very soon the government will have unfettered powers in two chambers—the greatest level of power any Australian government has had since 1981—and therefore, I would say, a greater inclination to rush through legislation that is flawed.</para><para>We support this bill, notwithstanding the comments made by the minister, who said that we were just scaremongering. It was Labor that highlighted the flaws in the system last year. But we say this to the government: do not hurry if you want to make good law; indeed, listen to the critics and provide the capacity for this chamber and the Senate chamber, the chamber of review, to consider bills in this term. If the government fails to do that, we will find ourselves in the same position over and over again—the position we find ourselves in this morning.</para><para>I wish to say a number of things on the broader question of family tax benefits and the way in which the government has responded, but I will not do that this morning. However, I do warn the government to reconsider its approach and to focus on the policy, not the politics. Then we might find ourselves in a better position all round.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>26</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2161">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Adjustment of Certain FTB Child Rates) Bill 2004</inline> could just as easily have been titled the `Honey, I stuffed it up (Adjustment of Certain FTB Child Rates) Bill 2004'. The government made an error in the announcements that were first made, and for some considerable time it denied the claims by Labor and the Australian Council of Social Service that over time its legislation would have the effect of clawing back the $600 payment per child. Only when it got over its indignation about any suggestion that Labor might have it right did the government examine this. It then realised that in fact it had made a bad error.</para></talk.start><para>As a consequence, we are debating this legislation today because it seeks to rectify that error. To put a monetary figure on the dimensions of the error, this legislation in 2007-08 involves extra expenditure of almost $25 million, which is not an insignificant amount. That is just the beginning of the impact of the error that the government made; that error would compound over time with the erosion of the benefit. So the government has finally admitted its mistake and here we are rectifying that mistake. I join with the member for Gorton who said that now that the government will be controlling the Senate from 1 July it should take note of its capacity to make errors such as this and not seek to rush legislation through. A temptation for ministers will be to try to get their legislation through the House and Senate very quickly and to not agree to Senate inquiries, which often have the beneficial impact of identifying unintended consequences of legislation. </para><para>Quite often, Labor approach those Senate inquiries with the objective of improving legislation, whether or not we fundamentally agree with it. The reality is that the government is elected and, if it is going to put legislation through the parliament, let us make sure it is the best possible legislation. Ministers could take note of the lesson that is provided in this legislation—that is, rushing legislation through due to arrogance is going to end up in humiliation at some point, particularly after 1 July if legislation is rammed through the Senate and the minister has to sponsor the fixing up of errors in it, which no doubt he or she would want to deny until it became a statement of the bleeding obvious.</para><para>I point out that the $600 per child payment is one component of the $66 billion spending spree in which this government engaged to secure its re-election. It is astonishing that, at a time when the economy has been growing strongly and consumer spending has been growing at almost unprecedented rates, the government has seen fit to pour petrol on that consumer spending fire through increasing the call on the budget to the extent of that $66 billion. Only around $5 billion of it could be categorised as investment spending; the balance of $61 billion over four years best fits the description of consumption spending. It is precisely the wrong time for a government to be fuelling consumption when consumption is already going at such a cracking pace. That is why the Reserve Bank has finally belled the cat in its <inline font-style="italic">Statement on Monetary Policy</inline> released the day before yesterday, where it identifies very strong consumer confidence, which is close to record levels; very strong labour market conditions; and a range of other available information suggesting the economy was in strong condition through last year and is likely to have maintained a good pace of growth entering 2005.</para><para>There were some suggestions that the housing bubble was deflating—that is in fact true. But there are now some indications, as identified by the Reserve Bank, that perhaps that deflation has run its course. Page 3 of the Reserve Bank statement says:</para><quote><para>More recently, there have been some signs of prices and finance levelling out, or possibly rising.</para></quote><para>If Australia is confronted with that house price bubble re-inflating, given that it has not deflated by very much, we are in for very tricky and challenging times. But you would not know it, because the government, absolutely committed to its re-election rather than to good economic management, has added $66 billion to demand in Australia. We are in a situation where domestic demand is growing rapidly but exports are performing terribly. Imports are surging, which is associated with that domestic demand. We have the best terms of trade since 1972 but appalling performance in export volumes. In parliament yesterday the Minister for Trade said, `What is the problem? Exports are larger than they were a few years ago.' On the back of record terms of trade anyone could have achieved a growth in export values in nominal terms. But the minister was very keen to blame everything and everyone but himself and the government for the stagnation of export volumes, which mean that Australia has put in its worst export performance since the Second World War.</para><para>Why is this relevant to a debate on a $600 family payment? The answer is that the surge in consumer spending in this country and our terrible export performance are creating a large external imbalance. Trade deficits have now been going on for 37 consecutive months with no end in sight. The current account deficit, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Statement of Monetary Policy</inline>, is approaching 6.75 per cent, which the Reserve Bank itself identifies as a record. The Treasurer, who was asked about the current account deficit yesterday, is behaving like a character from <inline font-style="italic">The Life of Brian</inline>—always look on the bright side of life! `What is the problem with a 6.75 per cent current account deficit?' Yesterday he was asked about his statement in 1995 that a six per cent current account deficit is unsustainable. He said that in unequivocal terms, not referring to the composition of the current account deficit or the extent to which it was associated with a budget deficit. He said flatly that a six per cent current account deficit is unsustainable. If a current account deficit of six per cent of GDP is unsustainable, why is a current account deficit of 6.75 per cent suddenly sustainable? The answer is that it is not. It is not sustainable. </para><para>In its country report on Australia late last year the IMF pointed to the growing current account deficit and began questioning its sustainability. Economic commentators in this country and, I fear, economists within the government bureaucracy, have overinterpreted the Pitchford thesis to regard it as saying that the current account deficit does not matter. That is in fact not the case. The current account deficit can matter, especially when it is financing rampant consumer spending. We have had 37 successive trade deficits and record current account deficits, which are adding to Australia's foreign debt.</para><para>When the present Treasurer and the present Prime Minister rolled out their debt truck in 1995 Australia's foreign debt was $180 billion. They said that was completely unsustainable, that it was selling out Australia's future and that it was $10,000 for every man, woman and child in this country. The net foreign debt is now $406 billion, or $20,000 for every man, woman and child in this country. If it was selling out Australia's sovereignty and Australia's future when it was $10,000 for every man, woman and child in the country, what does that say about a debt of $20,000 for every man, woman and child in the country? Again, back in 1995 when Labor in government pointed out that a very substantial proportion of that foreign debt was in fact private foreign debt, the current Treasurer said, `Look, the only thing that one needs to get one's mind around is the size of the foreign debt of $180 billion.' The Treasurer ought to get his mind around the size of the foreign debt now of $406 billion.</para><para>Every day that this government is fuelling consumption spending through its $66 billion spending spree it is adding to the trade deficit, it is adding to the current account deficit and it is adding to net foreign debt. But the government is so blas about this; it does not seem to be concerned. It might not be concerned but the Reserve Bank is concerned. If you read that <inline font-style="italic">Statement on Monetary Policy</inline> issued two days ago, you will see it has a chilling warning for those households who are receiving the $600 payment that we are debating today. The Reserve Bank appears to be preparing the Australian public for an increase in mortgage interest rates. What the government gives with one hand, the Reserve Bank has to take away with the other because of the government's economic mismanagement. What comfort is it to the Australian families who receive this $600 payment per child if mortgage interest rates go up? Australian borrowers have borrowed to the hilt. Even a one-quarter of one percentage point rise in mortgage interest rates can mean a very substantial addition to repayment obligations.</para><para>Before the election the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were trying to create the impression that interest rates would not be a problem if the Liberal-National coalition was re-elected. Yet here we are, just months after the election, and the Reserve Bank bells the cat and basically says that the government's economic mismanagement and its failure to rein in budget spending—in fact, it is adding fuel to the fire—has put the Reserve Bank in a situation where it may have no alternative but to increase mortgage interest rates. It is a result of the government's economic mismanagement. The government knew what it was doing; this was not negligence. It was adding almost $66 billion to already rampant consumer spending for one purpose only: not to manage the economy but to organise its re-election and then worry about the interest rate rises later. </para><para>On the last day of parliament last year the Treasurer said, `Let's hope we have a happy retailing Christmas.' In the same answer he talked about how maybe you should give love for Christmas and not a Christmas present. Then at the end of that answer he said: `Let's hope we have a happy retailing Christmas'—in other words, let us hope it goes on and on and everyone enjoys this consumption boom. Now the Treasurer and other ministers are in the parliament saying that this consumption boom is creating a few problems—that there is a shortage of skills and that is going to create wage pressures, as identified by the Reserve Bank two days ago. The government's response to the wage pressures is: `We'll have more industrial relations reform.' What for? To stop wages rising?</para><para>The problem is that there is an excess demand for skilled people. Industrial relations changes, government style, will not mean that those skilled people will command, in a market economy, lower wages. How is further deregulation of the labour market going to ease wage pressures when the problem is that there is already very strong excess demand for skilled employees in this country? The answer is that it will not solve the problem. All it does is give the government another excuse to say, `Everything would have been all right if we had just been able to deregulate the labour market a little bit more.' Instead of trying to create political scapegoats out of the Australian trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party, the government ought to accept its economic responsibilities and implement policies such that mortgage interest rate increases would not be necessary. Through buying its way back into government the coalition has dramatically increased the likelihood of those interest rates rising.</para><para>I now want to make an observation about the family payment system. The family payment system has quite a history. Conceptually, it is a good approach because it does seek to redistribute income to those who have less financial and private market capacity. But it has been augmented year after year to the point where it has become a very expensive system indeed. One measure of that expense is that the total collection of personal income tax in 2004-05 is estimated by the budget at $102 billion but total spending on social security and welfare is estimated at $82 billion—that is, around 80 per cent of all the personal income tax collected in this country is then sent back out in the form of family and other payments.</para><para>That suggests a large amount of churning—that is, the government taxing people, taking the money off them, having it collected by the tax office through often high effective marginal tax rates and then going around and saying: `What jolly good fellows we are. Here's some family payments back.' Here is a radical thought for a coalition government: maybe it would be better not to tax them so much in order to be jolly good fellows and give some of it back in family payments. To the extent that the family payments system provides a genuine redistribution I would support it, but there must be many billions of dollars of revenue collected through the tax system that is returned to the same taxpayers. So the radical thought is: maybe we need to have a look at the whole tax and income support system and see whether we can simplify it. Maybe we could use some of the proceeds that are just being recycled to the same families by the government so that it can get the accolades of saying, `Here's some money in the pocket for you'—money that it took out of the other pocket. Maybe it is time for a fundamental look at that. </para><para>I understand that the government is looking afresh at these ideas. My belief is that over the last 15 or 20 years the tax system and the family payments system have grown incrementally, not necessarily rationally, and often in order for a government to be re-elected. In 2000 it was increased very substantially as compensation for the GST, because the government recognised that it was not going to be able to compensate people properly for the GST through the tax system alone and that it would need to do so through the family payments system. We have a higgledy-piggledy system that has been built up with some rationality in it but a very large amount of irrationality—of political opportunism—in it. Maybe this is the time to have a good look at the interaction of the tax and family payments systems.</para><para>Labor brought a policy to the last election which sought to reduce effective marginal tax rates for particular income groups and households. That policy had a lot to commend it. It is interesting to note a report by Gillian Beer of NATSEM as to where—this was in 2002, so there have been some changes—the high effective marginal tax rates are. It is revealed that only eight per cent of individuals face effective marginal tax rates above 60 per cent. Of individuals with earnings, only 11 per cent face effective marginal tax rates above 60 per cent. Fifteen per cent of couples with children face high effective marginal tax rates, defined as effective marginal tax rates above 60 per cent, and 23 per cent of sole parents face them. They are the two types of households that face these high effective marginal tax rates. Interestingly, there is a concentration of these high effective marginal tax rates in the middle income ranges. This report and the work of NATSEM is important in forming a proper reform process for our income tax and social security systems. Let us look at it afresh, let us rebuild it, let us make it a rational system and reform the higgledy-piggledy system that has been built up through successive governments seeking re-election and making in many cases very irrational decisions.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>30</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are here today because the government has been caught out. The government was caught out with its sleight of hand where it was trying to hoodwink Australian families with the $600 family tax payment and the yearly payment that was a provision of the legislation last year. It hoodwinked them through the indexation process that was introduced at that time. Let us get this straight right now: there would have been absolutely no change whatsoever to the original legislation had the government not been caught out. This is a government that has been caught out, yet again.</para></talk.start><para>We are here now revisiting the legislation with the <inline ref="R2161">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Adjustment of Certain FTB Child Rates) Bill 2004</inline> to correct an anomaly that arose when the $600 family tax benefit supplement payment was introduced. It was an anomaly that existed because the government thought it could get away with it. It was an anomaly that would have affected Australian families. This is a government that has a long history of introducing legislation which on the surface looks pretty good but which has quite a negative effect on families. I hate to say that this government has really been dragged screaming into the chamber to alter the legislation.</para><para>The original bill had provisions that would allow the government to claw back the value of the $600 supplementary payment over a six- to seven-year period and hope that the Australian people would not notice it. We probably need to get this straight, too; let me put it on the record: this $600 payment would not have been necessary had the government revisited the way it calculated the family tax benefit payment—a payment that results time and time again in families receiving notices from Centrelink that they have incurred a debt. The way it is calculated is a design fault. Families are required to determine their income in advance, and we all know that circumstances change. A person only needs to get a pay rise or work a bit of overtime and the next thing we know a debt has been incurred. </para><para>Whilst this legislation will fix the clawback provision of the previous legislation, it will do absolutely nothing to correct the flawed system used to calculate the family tax benefit. I cannot understand why the government cannot admit that it is wrong, go back to the drawing board and fix this issue once and for all. I suppose it requires a bit of character to admit you have made a mistake and to admit that you have duped the Australian people—to admit that you have in place a system that causes family after family to incur debts. I will talk a little more about that later.</para><para>This legislation, as I have mentioned, corrects an indexation anomaly that arose as a result of the legislation that introduced a $600 family tax benefit supplementary payment following the budget last year. Under the adjustment arrangements provided in the bill, if the family tax benefit for the under-13 child rate, as indexed by the consumer price index, is less than the amount worked out using the formula, CPC rate times 16.6 per cent, the family tax benefit under-13 rate is increased to the amount determined under the formula. The position is the same for the family tax benefit rate for children aged 13 to 16 years, except that the formula is the CPC rate times 21.6 per cent. Collectively, these tests are known as the safety net benchmark.</para><para>The arrangements provided for in the bill are the same as those which applied for family tax benefits prior to the passage of the legislation that introduced the family tax payment supplement following the 2004 budget. I cannot understand why the correct calculations were not included in the first piece of legislation. Being the suspicious person that I am when it relates to this government, I would have to say that they hoped that we would not notice but on this side of the House we are a pretty good opposition and we can pick up those things very quickly. We know that this government are always using some sleight of hand, some way to trick the Australian people. On this particular occasion we have made them accountable. We have made them forget the clawback provision they had in the initial legislation, and we have this legislation before us today.</para><para>Since the $600 family tax benefit supplement was introduced, Labor has argued time and time again that the government was attempting to claw back this payment by also changing the indexation arrangement for normal family tax benefit payments. We on this side of the House know that is true; we know that the government would have done that. That would have been the result if it had not been for the Labor Party—if it had not been for the opposition—because that is the way this government works. Because legislation introducing the $600 payment was delayed in the year in which it was introduced, the pre-existing safety net benchmark provisions came into effect. The CPI would be the sole means of adjusting normal family tax benefit payments, and, because the rate of the CPI base increases in the family tax benefit over the next few years, they are likely to be considerably less than they would have been under the safety net benchmarks and the government would have clawed back the entire $600 over six to seven years. </para><para>We have seen this in other areas where the government has introduced clawback provisions. Some of it has been seen in audits in the aged care area. Teams have been going back and reassessing the RCSs and patient classifications have been reassessed. The government gives with one hand and takes with the other. We know that; the Australian people know that. If the minister had been really serious about it, this legislation would have been amended in the last parliament.</para><para>This government has a philosophy of frowning on people who are in receipt of any sort of welfare payment. It supports families on its terms—and its terms alone. I think that the family tax benefit is one of those pieces of legislation where the government gives lip service to helping families, but, on the other hand, it actually creates a lot of problems for families. The one-off $600 payment made last year was designed to bribe Australian families pre-election, and the annual payment of $600 afterwards is just an attempt to fix a flawed system and a very poor attempt at that. It is interesting to note when the requests for repayment of family debts came out—they came out after the election. That was no surprise to any of us on this side of the House.</para><para>The problem with the family tax benefit is the method of calculation. The problem with the system is that it is a very rigid system, and it is a problem that causes enormous problems for people in Australia. In the electorate of Shortland, it is estimated that, each year, over 4,000 families have debts averaging $900 each, and that is because of the flawed family tax benefit system. Keeping in mind that I said that is the average debt, and that over one-third of the people who are in receipt of family tax benefits in Shortland electorate are incurring those debts, that is a significant number of people.</para><para>I have had numerous families come and visit me about debts, and I do not mean one or two people: I mean a significant number of people. They come and visit me with debts of $3,000, $4,000 or, in some cases, even larger amounts. I rang my office this morning and asked them to pull out some details of people who have incurred debts within the electorate in relation to the family tax benefit. I was going to talk about some of those examples here this morning. But, when I received 20 pages of debt details with some 10 names to each page, I thought that would take up too much of the time of the House.</para><para>It is a flawed system. If the government was really serious about helping families, it could revisit that system, not with a stopgap measure to change the method of calculation but rather by addressing the core issue and fixing the problem once and for all.</para><para>I mentioned earlier in my speech that the government has a very ambivalent approach to providing welfare to people within Australia, be it families, pensioners or particularly people who are unemployed. We are going to see legislation reintroduced in this House relating to the disability support pension and people with disabilities, an area that is very dear to my heart and that I know is causing great angst within my electorate. This whole ambivalence towards welfare payments is of great concern to me. I saw an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>—and I wish I had brought it to the House with me—that talked about government expenditure. It showed that the largest area of government expenditure was in the area of welfare.</para><para>The thing that really concerns me, given the government's philosophy and given the percentage of GDP that is actually spent on welfare payments, is that this government is going to move down the line of privatising Centrelink and privatising our welfare system. That really concerns me. We are seeing moves in the US along that line, and it has been put to me by people who work in the system now that the government has already started this, and it is doing it by stealth. Rather than a wholesale sell-off of Centrelink or associated services, this government will follow a process of outsourcing one function and outsourcing another function, and then effectually you will just have a very small core that has very little responsibility and a very small role. </para><para>That is not the Australian way. The Australian way is to look after all Australians. If a person is in need, needs a little extra assistance, the Australian way is to provide it. The Australian way when it comes to supporting families is to put in place a system where Australian families do not incur debts. The Australian way is to look after people. This piece of legislation does go towards effecting a change to legislation that was going to claw back money from Australian families, but unfortunately I do not think it really resolves the core issue. The core issue is to look after Australian families and to make that commitment to Australian families, Australia's future, and to ensure that every child in Australia has the opportunity to have the financial support that they need. That is the idea behind the family tax benefit.</para><para>So I support this legislation, but in doing so I have to state very strongly that I am disappointed. I am disappointed that the government had to introduce this legislation. I am disappointed that it took the opposition identifying the problem that existed—or catching the government out—for the government to take this action. I am very disappointed that the government has not revisited the legislation, changed a flawed system and introduced a family tax benefit system that will not lead to Australian families incurring debts and therefore necessitating a $600 payment to offset that. I should add, as a rider to that, that the $600 does not even meet the average debt incurred by families in the Shortland electorate. I support the legislation, but in doing so I hope that my comments have been noted.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

The <inline ref="R2161">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Adjustment of Certain FTB Child Rates) Bill 2004</inline> amends the adjustment provisions in the family assistance law as they apply to the family tax benefit child rates for children under 13 and those aged from 13 to 15. Prior to the introduction of the family tax benefit part A supplement on 1 July 2004, the safety net benchmark for these FTB child rates was 16.6 per cent of the combined pensioner couple rate for children under 13 and 21.6 per cent of the combined pensioner couple rate for children aged 13 to 15. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The safety net benchmark applied if CPI indexation of these rates resulted in a lesser rate of payment than under the formula. The annual rate of family tax benefit payable for children in these age groups was effectively increased with the introduction earlier this year of a $600 per child family tax benefit part A supplement. The family tax benefit part A supplement is a separate payment that is CPI indexed on 1 July each year and paid as a lump sum at the end of the relevant income year. This additional payment was also reflected in the benchmark formula. This bill further amends the formula to ensure that fortnightly payments of family tax benefit part A in respect of children under 13 and children aged 13 to 15 will be indexed by the greater of either the CPI or a percentage of the combined pensioner couple rate without regard to the supplement. The fortnightly rates will be adjusted at the same time and for the same amount as would have occurred before the introduction of the family tax benefit part A supplement. These changes ensure that the intention of the policy is being delivered and that the real value of fortnightly payments of family tax benefit part A are maintained. The $600 per child family tax benefit part A supplement will continue to be indexed each year in line with increases in the CPI, as is currently provided for in the family assistance law. The real value of the supplement will be maintained through this indexation to the CPI.

The AusLink package is an exciting step forward and represents a new era of funding of land transport infrastructure in this nation. The Hon. John Anderson had the visionary drive to establish a blueprint for transport infrastructure into our future. I certainly was very supportive of this when I came into this House, recognising that there were significant issues with port and rail authorities and transport and road access to many areas across the Riverina. These areas are great producers, have an enormously beneficial export record for the benefit of this nation and require transport infrastructure and access to be delivered into the future. </para></talk.start><para>Without substantial and modern land transport infrastructure, the development of communities that rely so heavily on the ability to transport their produce to markets will be severely impacted upon. This government has recognised this and has worked to ensure that our infrastructure is not only maintained but improved to ensure the viability of our economies well into the future. Many road and rail networks fall under the responsibility of state and territory governments, which are certainly making it very difficult for local government through a series of cost-shifting processes, as the member for Hunter would be well aware, that is almost not able to be contained. The state and territory governments are falling well short of what their commitment should be to ensure the viability of the states and particularly of my electorate of Riverina. Certainly we should be working together to improve our road and rail infrastructure. By doing this, we would be able to achieve a good outcome—the best outcome—for not only the people of Australia but most importantly for those very good people of the Riverina. A very good working relationship with states and the Commonwealth is what AusLink is all about—working together in a holistic manner to achieve a network of land infrastructure that will continue to assist growth and development throughout this nation.</para><para>Having said that the states have been a major problem in the past, I congratulate them for coming forward and being part of a national initiative to ensure that we move forward as a collective team regardless of politics and look out for the interests of the people and the producers and the businesses of Australia. I think it has been a very worthwhile exercise but it took the Leader of The Nationals and the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, to bring these people to the table, to give them some vision so that they recognise that, yes, it is possible for us to work together as a collective for the benefit of the people of Australia. I am sure the member for Hunter would agree with that initiative.</para><para>Significant funding announcements have been made by this government for projects that I have lobbied for since being elected as the member for Riverina and they have been successful. Projects such as the funding for the Coolac Bypass have been a priority for my communities for many years now. Together we have lobbied government for funding and have been successful. I am very pleased to state that today, 9 February, I put out a press release headed `Calling of Coolac Bypass tenders welcomed'. I stated:</para><quote><para>The Nationals—</para></quote><para>I am very proud to be a member—</para><quote><para>Member for Riverina Kay Hull today welcomed the calling of tenders for the construction of the $117 million Coolac Bypass, saying it represented an important milestone in the development of the region.</para></quote><para>Together the community and I have been lobbying for this, particularly the Mayor of Gundagai Shire Council, Len Tozer, a very good man, and the General Manager, Graham Tickner. The community have assisted me by ensuring that they put their support right behind my efforts to have funding for the Coolac Bypass put into place. The tenders that have been called also end uncertainty for landowners who have been affected by the proposed construction of this 12-kilometre bypass since about 1992 when the proposal came up. Finally, with the help of the Department of Transport and Regional Services, the Hon. John Anderson's office and the community, I have very great pleasure in saying that I have been able to put funding in place. In the press release, I stated: </para><quote><para>The construction period also represents an opportunity for the businesses and people of Coolac to manage the transition to a day when the highway will no longer pass through town.</para><para>The incorporation of two rest areas within the project will emphasise Coolac's traditional role as a highway service town. I will be working to ensure that Coolac is well signposted from the highway.</para><para>... local traffic movements had been an important consideration in the bypass design.</para><para>The project includes construction of an interchange at Cootamundra Road with a bridge over the highway, which will also provide motorists with access to Coolac village.</para><para>Motorists travelling northbound will be able to access Pettit Village and Gobarralong Road by a ramp and underpass at Coleman Street.</para></quote><para>This is a significant amount of work that has been so long in the making. Finally, after a bit of procrastination we are starting to see benefits and outcomes for this long-awaited bypass. The Australian government has earmarked $1 billion for the Hume Highway upgrade as well. These sorts of projects have been realised and the government has committed to them through the AusLink process. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services made a brief visit to my electorate last year and announced this money and he was absolutely applauded throughout the Riverina area. There have been huge death tolls and huge accident rates in Coolac. This matter has been in need of resolution for a long time. I thank the minister for resolving this issue.</para><para>The government has also committed an additional $714 million for the Hume Highway in New South Wales and Victoria. The aim is duplicate the highway by 2012. This is long overdue. Another successful outcome was the decision by the government to provide funding of $7 million to improve the West Street exit at Gundagai and to construct an overpass. Gundagai became part of my electorate of Riverina in the 2001 election. It is a fantastic `can do' community and one that I am very proud to represent. We have worked together very strongly in the last three years since the Gundagai community became part of my electorate to ensure that we brought some very good and tangible benefits back to Gundagai. With the continued lobbying and ongoing support from the Gundagai community, we are looking to have this matter resolved and this very dangerous area fixed.</para><para>Gundagai was one of the first towns that was bypassed over 20 years ago. The community have been living with a dangerous situation ever since. This project is one of my priorities. Funnily enough, as a politician I do not make promises, but this project is one thing that I wanted to deliver to Gundagai, one thing that I promised I would work myself into the ground in trying to deliver. I think this is the only promise I have ever made: to tangibly deliver a project and outcome and, thankfully, I was successful. This is a great day not only for Gundagai but also for me. But I do not think it will encourage me to make greater promises in the future. It is very difficult as a politician to deliver promises. </para><para>As a region renowned for its produce, the Riverina and the MIA areas are dependent on road and rail transport, particularly road transport, to move their products to both domestic and international markets. Many businesses throughout our region are exporters, while many more are encouraged to do so. Without modern and reliable road and rail infrastructure the ability for these producers to further develop markets is very restricted. I have often indicated in this House just how very proud I am of my electorate for the production that it generates: wine from the magnificent wineries, citrus, and rice from the great company of Sunrice. We have a huge amount of exports in our region and they would be hampered if we did not have adequate transport and land infrastructure. A number of highly successful programs are also included as part of the AusLink package, such as a continuation of our Roads to Recovery program and black spot road safety projects.</para><para>I remember that when I came into this House as a new member I was very keen—and I still am. I sat down and worked out a way in which we could increase funding to local governments. Coming from local government, having been the deputy mayor of Wagga Wagga City Council prior to my entry into the House, I realised that there was a call on local government to provide a never-ending source of funding for roadworks. When I came into the House I thought that that would be one of the very good things we could do.</para><para>John Anderson, to his credit, gave us an opportunity as National Party backbenchers to work together as a collective to try to come up with a proposal that would see money going directly to local government rather than through the states, with them channelling off most of that money into other, unrelated areas. Without doubt, I believe the program that John Anderson introduced has been the most successful program ever introduced into this parliament. Everybody applauds this program because it gives councils the opportunity to directly take this money and put it into their priorities for their local road infrastructure, which can assist them to grow their industries and their businesses. It is a great program which provides much needed assistance to local councils in the Riverina.</para><para>I would like to see all roads programs and all funding go directly to local governments. This initiative has proven that councils can manage their own funds reliably and accountably, and you can actually see results delivered on the ground. I think that the more funds we can channel out of the state coffers and directly into local government, the better the benefits that will come not just to country people but to city people. I am sure that city people also lose a lot of the benefits of the funding that is designed to go directly to them, rather than into state coffers for a host of other reasons.</para><para>Many of the shire councils that I represent are responsible for thousands of kilometres of roads, yet they often and most likely have a small rate base, so it is very difficult for them to sustain the road network. Carrathool Shire Council, for interest's sake, have an enormous road base for which they have to address maintenance, renewal and new roads, yet they have a very limited rate base.</para><para>This Roads to Recovery money and the black spot program are very important. We reintroduced black spot funding. I stand to be corrected, but I think a Labor government in this House wiped out black spot funding and we saw the need to reintroduce it. And it is just so helpful, so I applaud the government again for having the foresight to say, `This is what we need to do for those many people out there.' </para><para>As I have indicated before, cost shifting is occurring at a great pace, with the state government passing on more and more responsibility to local councils. Local councils are struggling to maintain thousands of kilometres of roads. They are trying to attract doctors, they are trying to provide medical surgeries and they are trying to prop up the failing health system. In New South Wales under the Carr Labor government we have a failing health system, with the introduction of super regions giving people less and less access to decision makers for health initiatives in their regions.</para><para>Local governments have the entire responsibility for an array of community services that are no longer funded by the states. They are kind of representing the states' interests now and delivering most of the states' agenda. Maybe that is a good call; maybe there is a call for the abolition of states. Probably something that should be debated at some stage is just what benefit the states provide, because they are no longer responsible for anything. We hear time and time again in this House about our ailing health system, which the states are responsible for, and about our public education system, which the states are responsible for. Every day the states want the federal government to be responsible for more money, saying, `Give us more, gimme, gimme.' They do not want to be responsible for anything. They want to divest themselves of some education responsibility and hand it over to the federal government in return for something else. It is almost like the states are starting to put their own agenda together to see themselves removed and some other form of government established. We are here to talk about the AusLink legislation, but that was a nice niche to move into because it raises some questions.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Hatton)</inline>—As long as you do not stay there too long, that is fine.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83O</name.id><name role="metadata">Hull, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs HULL</name></talker><para>—I really am staying well and truly within the bills. With the continuation of the Roads to Recovery program to 2009 and another $1.2 billion, or $300 million a year, many more local projects and roads will be completed, ensuring the safety of the many people that I represent, that you represent, Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton, and that many people in this House represent in their local communities. We have had a significant amount of Roads to Recovery program money in the Riverina electorate. Since 1998, more than $380 million has been delivered to my local governments to enable them to develop and maintain very important local roads.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the most recent round of funding under the national black spot program, in early 2004, more than $953,000 was announced for councils in the Riverina. Works to be completed under this program included installing roundabouts at dangerous intersections, installing median strips, improving signage, carrying out realignments and resurfacing, and widening local roads. I hope that those members who are involved with the New South Wales state government recognise that that is certainly assisting local areas in New South Wales and that the state government should come on down with a little bit of money to try to assist these councils as well, rather than cost-shifting back onto them.</para><para>Additionally, AusLink funding has provided $3.6 million to widen the Sturt Highway west of Hay—a fantastic community—and $4.6 million to construct new bridges on the Sturt Highway west of Narrandera. I launched a tourism brochure, <inline font-style="italic">Narrandera—Heart of the Riverina</inline>, just last Friday. All the road improvements that have come from the AusLink package will do a great deal to assist tourism and give communities the ability to attract significant visitation with greater ease, as they have a very much better road network that tourists can travel on. The brochure <inline font-style="italic">Narrandera—Heart of the Riverina</inline> is an absolute credit to the Narrandera Tourist Board, the printers and all the business houses in Narrandera who have got behind this and decided that they want to take significant benefits from the tourism dollar that might be available. That tourism dollar can only assist if we have good road and transport infrastructure, including rail and air. A whole host of areas that are providing benefits back to country people are coming from this AusLink project. I congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of The Nationals, for having the great initiative and innovation to put together this proposal, which can deliver such tangible benefits to the people of the Riverina. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>39</page.no><name role="metadata">Hoare, Kelly, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HOARE</name><name.id>83Y</name.id><electorate>Charlton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to speak on the <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2237">AusLink (National Land Transport—Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004</inline>. This package of bills provides for an integrated network of road and rail linkages of strategic national importance, including funding provisions for programs under the new national land transport network; black spot projects; and new discretionary funding for strategic regional projects and continuing projects under the Roads to Recovery program.</para></talk.start><para>The AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004 gives effect to the government's national land transport policy set out in the white paper which was called <inline font-style="italic">AusLink</inline><inline font-style="italic">:</inline><inline font-style="italic"> building our national transport future</inline>. The bill establishes a new framework for Australian government funding of land transport infrastructure and the arrangements for which the bill provides will replace over time those contained in the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 and the Roads to Recovery Act 2000. The Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 was originally introduced by the former member for Charlton—and land transport minister in the Hawke government—as the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act. Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton, I now have the task of telling my father that the first piece of legislation that he ever introduced as minister has now been replaced, and I know that you would not envy me that task.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Hatton)</inline>—I would not envy you; it is a challenge.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83Y</name.id><name role="metadata">Hoare, Kelly, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HOARE</name></talker><para>—This legislation provides funding for six categories of projects or activities. They include: AusLink national projects, which are projects on the national land transport network; AusLink transport development and innovation projects land transport research entities, which are related to the national land transport network land transport research entities; AusLink strategic regional projects; AusLink black spot projects; and the AusLink Roads to Recovery program.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Although this legislation is broadly supported by Labor, we have expressed quite a few concerns about it. Our major concern, which you have heard our shadow minister and other members in this debate speaking about, is that it provides quite considerable discretion for the minister to decide how to allocate funds under AusLink strategic regional projects, and the minister has and will continue to have considerable discretion over the AusLink Roads to Recovery program. Of course, we have concerns about that. I think the shadow minister has referred to it as pork-barrelling in times of elections to shore up support for regional members. </para><para>We also have a concern about the lack of consultation which has occurred with the states. Even though the legislation caps maintenance funding at $300 million a year, it places a further onus on the states. The consultation required for a satisfactory arrangement to develop under that process has not occurred. When the green paper was introduced, chapter 5 said that a joint working group on AusLink priorities on the national network was established to assist with developing a possible set of national infrastructure priorities for the initial five-year period of AusLink. However, all the state and territory governments have complained of little or no consultation in the development of national priorities under the first five-year AusLink national land transport plan. As a lot of the onus and funding is being put back to the states, the government would have got a more satisfactory outcome if they had consulted properly with the states and the territories.</para><para>Another concern with this legislation is the length of time it has taken for AusLink and the national road network to emerge: the process has taken over two years and still we do not know what the road network structure consists of. As we see from this legislation, that is going to evolve over time, but that is also going to be a matter for ministerial discretion. I can foresee a position in the future where the majority of the roads that are going to be part of the national network are going to flow through Liberal Party and National Party seats throughout the country. As I have mentioned and as the shadow minister and other speakers have mentioned, there is a huge potential for pork-barrelling under AusLink strategic regional projects. I would like to point out one example—whether it is pork-barrelling or a matter of priority, I do not know. I can only explain what the situation has been in my backyard.</para><para>My home town is Toronto. I drive to and from Canberra using the national highway system, taking the F3 through to Sydney and travelling on Pennant Hills Road, the Cumberland Highway and then down the Hume Highway to Canberra. As I have driven that route over the last 18 months or so I have noticed a fair bit of work going on down the F3 freeway in the electorates of Dobell and Robertson, which are just south of the electorate of Charlton. I have asked questions and pursued issues in relation to repairs and maintenance that I believe are urgently required on the F3 freeway, which traverses my electorate for some 50 kilometres. Down the road, as I said, road widening seems to be going on, extra lanes are being constructed and repairs are taking place. I have seen many of those big lights that indicate that night work is happening. But once you cross the electorate boundary into Charlton—and then later when you leave the electorate—there is nothing going on for those 50 kilometres of road, and there are quite a few areas there that require a great deal of maintenance. It will be a tragic day when pork-barrelling in government electorates, if that is what this is, is given greater priority than saving lives and stopping accidents and injuries in non-government held electorates.</para><para>On 17 November last year I placed the following questions on notice to the minister. I asked:</para><para>(1)	Is he aware that engineers of the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) conduct inspections of the F3 Freeway between Sydney and Newcastle and does his department receive advice of such inspections and their outcomes.</para><para>(2)	Does the Government provide funding to maintain and repair the F3 Freeway on the advice of the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority.</para><para>(3)	Is he aware that recent inspections by RTA officers have found evidence of cracked, dropped or crowned concrete slabs that require urgent replacement North of the Toronto interchange; if not, why not. </para><para>(4)	Is he aware of `spalls' or `potholes' on the F3 Freeway North of the Toronto interchange that have required constant repair for the last thirteen years; if not, why not.</para><para>(5)	Will he provide urgent funding to upgrade this section of road before motorists are killed or injured; if not, why not.</para><para>Those questions have not been answered yet. I will be taking the issue up with the Speaker after question time, in order to pursue the minister to get a response to those questions.</para><para>Still on the issue of electoral exploitation, I received quite a few phone calls during the election campaign—and I do not know whether many of my colleagues did, I have not pursued this with them—questioning the sudden erection throughout the electorate of signs indicating that local roadworks were being funded by the federal government under the Roads to Recovery program. We have always supported the Roads to Recovery program, and I have supported my local council in relation to the roads that they have allocated the funding to. During the election year these signs just started popping up all over the electorate where Roads to Recovery maintenance had taken place. However, some of the works had been going on for quite some time before the signs popped up, and some of the works had been completed for quite some time before the signs popped up. I ask the question: what kind of instructions were given to local councils around the country to make sure that during that election year those particular works were acknowledged as being funded by the federal government? That notwithstanding, Labor have of course indicated that we will continue to support the Roads to Recovery program.</para><para>The member for Riverina talked earlier about the black spot program. That program is another program that was introduced by the former member for Charlton—as the minister for land transport in the Hawke government. That was a great program and did a lot of good under the Hawke government. Of course we were pleased to see the program continue under this government, and we will continue to support it.</para><para>We also express our distaste at the obvious blackmailing of the states in relation to road funding. As we all know, the Commonwealth has now threatened to withhold funding unless the states drop their opposition to the Howard government's tough industrial relations laws, which require contractors to abide by draconian codes of practice, which have come out of the witch-hunt the government conducted in the construction industry. South Australia has had to succumb to those threats in order to receive funding of up to $275 million over the next five years for their AusLink projects. As the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations John Della Bosca said:</para><quote><para> ... the commonwealth is playing political games and reducing our per capita funding.</para></quote><para>We will just have to see how this process plays out. We have seen the indications that once the government gets a majority in the Senate it is going to be no holds barred in the area of industrial relations. This government has always been out to destroy unions and collective bargaining. It has always been out to destroy the protections and conditions that workers have enjoyed over the years—protections and conditions that have been built up and fought for over decades, if not centuries, of struggle by trade unionists.</para><para>I would like to refer briefly to a proposal for a major infrastructure development in my electorate of Charlton. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, whenever infrastructure funding legislation is introduced—or there are other debates in this place where I have the opportunity to do so—you would know that I often refer to this, because it has been a passion of mine since before I was elected. The Lake Macquarie City Council has identified an urgent need for the development of a transport hub in Glendale, known as the Lake Macquarie Integrated Transport Centre. The project is a major infrastructure development for the Hunter region and will generate jobs growth, improve access to public transport and provide environmental health benefits for Lake Macquarie. In the past 10 years in excess of 1,000 new employment positions have been created in Lake Macquarie—most within the Cardiff Industrial Park. It is proposed that the estate be expanded and further developed. The industrial area houses major transport and manufacturing firms, which provide employment and major export revenue for Australia. However businesses are hindered by treacherous and inefficient road links to the F3 freeway. Lake Macquarie City Council's proposed integrated transport strategy will alleviate this problem. </para><para>As I indicated, I seek leave to table the proposal prepared by the Lake Macquarie City Council Strategy Group entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Lake Macquarie Integrated Transport Centre: transport infrastructure for the Hunter's largest industrial park</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83Y</name.id><name role="metadata">Hoare, Kelly, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HOARE</name></talker><para>—The Hunter region has suffered significantly from the closure of BHP and the downturn in our manufacturing industries. This proposal will greatly assist in the maintenance and extension of employment opportunities in this region. Since before my election in 1998 I have lobbied the Commonwealth to participate in a whole-of-government approach to the centre. This has been repeatedly refused by various coalition government ministers. While shadow minister for economic ownership and community security at the time, Mark Latham, on a visit to the region, announced prior to the last election Labor's better regional cities program and indicated the proposed Lake Macquarie integrated transport centre would be appropriate for funding by a federal Labor government as part of the comprehensive regional infrastructure plan.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There has been ongoing consultation and discussion concerning transport infrastructure development in the Hunter region, and that will continue. It is a large region which requires these vital transport links to propel its sustainability into the future. My state colleagues in the region also support the development of this key transport infrastructure. One of my state colleagues, Mr John Mills, the state member for Wallsend, said:</para><quote><para>An integrated transport centre comprising rail, bus, private vehicle and pedestrian interchange facilities is necessary for Glendale, which sits at the demographic centre of the lower Hunter.</para><para>More people go to work in the commercial and industrial areas of Glendale, Cardiff and Warners Bay than in the whole of the Newcastle Central Business District.</para></quote><para>The New South Wales government has already committed to funding a railway station and a pedestrian overpass in this particular area. What we are asking is that the Commonwealth also come on board to provide an overpass road, a link road to enable the expansion of the industrial estate where a lot of people work. It is also supported by the member for Lake Macquarie, my colleague Jeff Hunter, MP.</para><para>Labor has long advocated an integrated national land transport plan. At the 2004 election we committed to fully funding the national highway network, the establishment of an national infrastructure advisory council to provide industry, expert and consumer advice on national priorities and to extend the criteria for Roads to Recovery projects to include public transport, cycling, walking infrastructure and regional airport runways. We believe that this legislation has the potential for a number of consequences which should be examined by a Senate committee. When this bill reaches the Senate we will seek to refer it to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs Legislation Committee, to report by May 2005 having examined matters including but not limited to the provisions for ministerial discretion for funding; the initial consultation process with the states and territories and the proposed consultation process for the next five-year period; the potential impact of proposed changes to funding of the national highway; the potential need to establish a national infrastructure advisory council; the potential to extend the criteria for Roads to Recovery projects to include public transport, cycling, walking infrastructure and regional airport runways; and the impact of removing the requirement to tie funding to non-transport related provisions of any bilateral funding agreements struck with the states and territories prior to the 2004 federal election—that is, those requiring adherence to the National Code of Practice for the Construction Industry. </para><para>This parliament must have a responsibility to ensure that the Commonwealth maintains funding responsibility for the construction and maintenance of infrastructure on what was formally defined as the national highway network, establishes an national infrastructure advisory council and extends the criteria for the Roads to Recovery projects, as I said, to include public transport, cycling, walking infrastructure and regional airport runways. I look forward to seeing some improvements made to this legislation which are vitally important to our country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>43</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbons, Steve, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GIBBONS</name><name.id>83X</name.id><electorate>Bendigo</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Howard government claims that AusLink will revolutionise the planning and funding of Australia's national roads and railways by taking a long-term strategic approach to the nation's long-term future.

AusLink is supposed to transform the way the Australian government plans and funds national transport infrastructure. Australia's major road and rail systems will be planned and developed together to produce a supposedly integrated and high-performing national network that will apparently build this nation's transport future.</para></talk.start><para>If this government's sorry record on funding the much needed Calder Highway redevelopment is anything to go by then AusLink is doomed from day one. The Howard government had to be dragged kicking and screaming all the way to have the Calder included in the AusLink program and then it did it only grudgingly. This project has been a constant example of this government's deceit and broken promises since November 1998, and there can be no clearer evidence of this government's treachery on Calder funding than the Treasurer's answer to a question from me on 11 September, 2003, where it could be argued that he deliberately misled the parliament by saying:</para><quote><para>The duplication—the two lanes—of the Calder Highway is being funded under the Roads of National Importance program, a program which never existed under the Labor Party. So if it had not been for this government ... none of that would have occurred ... under the Labor Party there would have been no Commonwealth contribution whatsoever in relation to that. So we have been building and extending the Calder Highway under that program—and, as I indicated, under the RONI program—fifty-fifty. That provides the funding for it.</para></quote><para>He said:</para><quote><para>I am sure that the Labor Party would acknowledge the fact that there would have been no funding if it had not been for the coalition.</para></quote><para>This arrogant Treasurer has deliberately misled this House and I want to show the lie in his claims that Labor had done nothing for the Calder. It was the Hawke Labor government that started the duplication of the Calder Highway. It funded the Big Hill to Ravenswood duplication that was completed in 1986. By 1996 the federal Labor government had provided around $75 million—estimated to be in excess of $155 million in today's dollars—for reconstructing and duplicating the Calder Highway. In other words, the last federal Labor government invested more in today's dollar values than the $100 million the Howard government has so far—and grudgingly—put into the highway. </para><para>The federal Labor government provided the funding under a number of programs, including the Australian Bicentennial Road Development program, the Australian Land Transport Development program, the One Nation roads program and the better cities road funding program. As I said before, a sum of $75 million in 1985 dollars equals over $155 million in today's dollars. The federal Labor government provided $2.8 million for the Gap Hill to Gisborne preconstruction, $15.2 million for the Kyneton bypass, $7.1 million for the Diggers Rest to Gap Hill preconstruction, $29.2 million for the Diggers Rest bypass, $13.2 million for the Keilor to Diggers Rest duplication, $2.04 million for the Big Hill to Ravenswood duplication, $2.05 million for the Harcourt to Ravenswood lane construction, and another $3 million for maintenance and lane construction.</para><para>What is also of great importance is that Labor set a target to finish the entire Calder Highway duplication from Melbourne to Bendigo by the year 2000. During the 2001 federal election campaign the Howard government said that it would match the state government's funding and that it accepted the state government's completion date of 2006. These promises it systematically dishonoured.</para><para>After stalling the project for another four years from 2001, it will be 2005 before any coalition Commonwealth funding will be allocated to the Calder, and the completion date will be 2011 or 2012 at the earliest—that is, assuming the coalition sticks to its most recent promise, something that history has shown is most unlikely to occur. In fact, the coalition's credibility has been run down and its promises are running on empty.</para><para>Because of the coalition government's inaction, dishonesty and blatant disregard for the motorists of central Victoria, the Calder Highway, one of the most important central Victorian infrastructure programs, will take longer to complete than the legendary Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme—just because the Howard-Anderson government originally wanted to walk away from the project. Central Victorian motorists are getting increasingly angry with the coalition—and is it any wonder?</para><para>Rapidly rising fuel prices and taxes are making central Victorian motorists even angrier with the federal government's stalling over the funding of the Calder Highway. In November 2001, when Treasurer Costello falsely promised Bendigo that it would match state funding for the Calder, Bendigo district motorists paid around 84.9c a litre for petrol. They paid 45.82c of this in excise and GST. It cost them around $50.94 to fill a 60-litre tank. They paid $27.49 of this to the Commonwealth in taxes. At that time, they paid around $16.15 in taxes and CityLink tolls for a return trip to Melbourne on the Calder Highway. In May 2004, central Victorian motorists were paying 105.9c a litre at many district outlets. Of this, they paid 47.64c to the federal government in taxes. Today they are paying $63.54 to fill up their tanks—$12.60 more than when Treasurer Costello made his phoney promise. Of this they are paying $28.58 in taxes—$1.09 more than in November 2001. They are now paying around $16.98 in taxes and tolls for a return trip on the same treacherously unfinished road to Melbourne. For their taxes, they have got nothing new on the Calder since Mr Costello's pre-election con job of November 2001. The Bendigo electorate pays around $90 million a year in fuel taxes plus GST; since the November 2001 election, it has paid over $200 million in such taxes. This is more than the amount needed to finish the Calder. Where has it gone? </para><para>The Howard government has stopped all new funding for the Calder, sabotaged the 2006 completion date promised by the Liberals during the 2001 election campaign and added millions to the cost of the remaining work. The only work now being done on the Calder is by the Bracks state government. Bendigo remains the only major regional centre in Victoria where motorists are taxed on an unfinished road and pay a CityLink entry tax plus GST to get into Melbourne. The Calder is a road potholed with Liberal lies and coalition cop-outs. In 1996 the Liberal Party promised to duplicate the highway. Instead it has only duplicated the taxes on the Calder. In November 2001 Treasurer Costello assured Bendigo that the Calder had a `much higher priority' with the government than the Scoresby Freeway, but a short while later he openly listed Scoresby as the government's top priority. This is the forked tongue of Mr Costello that really infuriates Calder motorists. Mr Costello was quoted as saying:</para><quote><para>What the Commonwealth does is that it enters into agreements with State Governments for the most important roads in order of priority and ... the order of priority is the Scoresby Freeway and then after we do the Scoresby Freeway we move on to the next one.</para></quote><para>In reality, from 1997—four years before it signed up Scoresby as a RONI in 2001—the government had an agreement with the state to fund the Calder. Since then Mr Costello has ratted on the Calder. The Scoresby is a `RONI come lately' compared to the Calder.</para><para>Now the Howard government has dudded the Calder yet again in its AusLink program by not allocating the full $193 million Commonwealth contribution needed to finish the project. The Treasurer is a master of pork-barrelling on the Scoresby and pork pies on the Calder. He took over six years to deliver his 1996 election promise to provide $2 million for Bendigo's arts facilities, and it is more than three years and two federal election campaigns since his promise to match the state funding for the Calder. Is it any wonder that opinion polls are showing that the Treasurer is extremely unpopular with Australian voters.</para><para>A former roads minister, Senator Ian Campbell, was Mr Costello's parliamentary secretary for four years. He was the minute taker for the coalition ministers that deserted the Calder at Kyneton. On the day he was appointed roads minister, the transport minister, John Anderson, openly admitted that Calder RONI funding was completed. Then, just before Senator Campbell visited Bendigo, Mr Anderson deliberately distorted the coalition's Calder RONI pledge to duplicate the whole road from Melbourne to Bendigo: it now only covered fixing up the `worst sections'. Labor's Calder guarantee would have enabled the state government to finish the project by the new 2009 deadline, which was caused by the Howard government's dumping of its own 2006 deadline.</para><para>Just in case there are any doubts regarding the Howard government's 2001 Calder Highway election promise—and leaving aside the Treasurer's now infamous 2001 election campaign commitment to match the state government's funding—I will again quote from a story in the <inline font-style="italic">Bendigo Weekly</inline> on Friday, 9 November 2001 written by the then federal Liberal candidate for Bendigo, Mr Maurie Sharkey. It states as part of his election platform—and remember that this is the 2001 election we are talking about—a `firm commitment to match dollar for dollar with the state government funding to complete the Calder to Bendigo by 2006'—which was the state government's time frame then. </para><para>Of course, this and other Calder Highway funding commitments from the coalition over the past four years are not worth the paper they are written on. The Howard government abandoned the Calder Highway at Kyneton and recklessly blew out the 2006 completion date it promised at the last election. There has been no new federal government money spent on the Calder Highway for over four years. It has disappeared from the Liberals' road map. The state government is the only government currently funding the two construction sites underway today. Now that the election is over the Howard government is still short changing us on the Calder Highway. The Liberals—the Liberal-Nationals that is—will take up to 10 years to finish it, if they ever do. They have put only enough money for the Calder Highway in the five-year AusLink program to half finish the remaining 43 kilometres of the highway, and a miserable amount of just $12 million for this year. There is no finishing date for the final Faraday to Ravenswood section.</para><para>The Calder Highway Improvement Committee has admitted that the Liberals will take seven to eight years to finish the road and it has branded this as `ludicrous'. Nobody in Bendigo trusts the Liberals or The Nationals any more. During the 2001 election campaign Treasurer Costello promised to keep up the duplication of the Calder Highway, but all he duplicated was road taxes. And now he has duplicated some of the worthless throwaway promises that he ditched after the last election. Labor stated time and time again in the months leading up to the last election and to the AusLink announcement that the Howard government would allocate a funding amount for the Calder Highway just to get them through the federal election. That is precisely what they have done by allocating $114 million over five years in the July AusLink statement when the amount required from the Commonwealth to complete the project is $193 million.</para><para>The Treasurer made the Calder Highway funding announcement in Geelong, which is nowhere near the Calder Highway. Apparently, the city of Geelong was about as close a city to Bendigo as the Treasurer was game enough to show up in. He also announced with a throwaway line in his media conference an extra $82 million to be available in the next five-year AusLink plan. Nothing in any of the AusLink information available at that time mentioned the additional $82 million. The minister responsible, Mr Anderson, never mentioned it. It was just another Treasurer Costello promise. However, that figure has very recently been added in a two line statement to the Department of Transport and Regional Services AusLink website. Then, as we got closer to the election announcement, the former and current junior roads ministers, Senator Ian Campbell and Mr Jim Lloyd, both stated that they would bring the $82 million forward into this five-year AusLink allocation if required. Apparently, they can just pluck $82 million out of the air to get them through an election campaign. It again begs the question: are these real dollars or are they Khemlani dollars? The fact that there are no forward estimates for the next AusLink five-year plan has conveniently escaped them. If they can pluck $82 million out of the air just to get them through an election why can they not pluck the full $193 million out of the air and finish the project within this five-year plan? That is the state government's time frame, but only if the Howard government honours its promises. </para><para>It is little wonder that the government ministers could not stay far enough away from Bendigo during the 2004 election campaign. Just one junior minister crept into the region and managed a short visit to Bendigo during the six-week campaign. The Prime Minister; Deputy Prime Minister; Treasurer; Minister for Health and Ageing; Minister for Education, Science and Training; and all of the other government ministers squibbed it because they know the depth of feeling Bendigo voters have against the coalition and its shoddy treatment of central Victoria. They did not have the courage to face the voters of Bendigo. There was little mention of the Calder Highway during the election campaign and now, in an attempt to slime out of some of its election commitments, the coalition has adopted the same old tactic of shifting the blame onto the states. As always, there will be plenty of supporters and government apologists to peddle the rubbish that the states are responsible for the delays involved in these projects.</para><para>Reports in the Bendigo media by journalist Anthony Radford have highlighted the enormous economic benefit that would flow on if the Calder Highway project is completed. More than $400 million would be injected into Bendigo's economy each year if the Calder Highway duplication was completed. Commissioned by Calder Highway lobby group Bendigo Plus, this study, and the ensuing report, also found that the flow-on effect of the economic boost would create some 2,731 jobs—almost nine per cent of the present work force. The report, written by principal research fellow at La Trobe University's Bendigo Centre for Sustainable Regional Communities, Mr Ian Pinge, identified Bendigo's manufacturing sector as one of the main beneficiaries of a new highway, with output tipped to jump by $212 million.</para><para>The subsequent effect of that growth alone was expected to be worth almost $210 million. The report predicts that cultural and recreational services would increase output by some $14.5 million, with a flow-on effect of more than $13 million. Accommodation, cafes and restaurants were also expected to benefit by $7.4 million, with a flow-on effect worth $7.5 million if the duplication was completed. Almost 900 manufacturing jobs would be directly created from the duplication, creating another 1,450 subsequent jobs from the flow-on effect. More than 130 jobs were expected to be created in the cultural and recreation services sector and almost 90 in the accommodation and food sector. The job figures were based on 50 per cent of the present difference between the sectors in Bendigo and Ballarat. Mr Pinge said Ballarat was chosen as a comparison because it had similar population and work force figures. It was also a similar distance from Melbourne and had a four-lane highway. In his report, Mr Pinge was quoted as saying the figures may well be even higher. He said:</para><quote><para>The final figures must be seen as conservative because only half of the employment differences in sectors including manufacturing have been attributed to road access.</para></quote><para>He went on:</para><quote><para>Benefits will be higher when the effects on all areas benefiting from the duplication of the Calder freeway are taken into account.</para></quote><para>The Calder Highway between Kyneton and Ravenswood would have to be one of the most dangerous sections of road in Australia. Last week, we witnessed yet another fatal accident on a non-duplicated section of the highway. When will this government throw in the towel, stop deliberately avoiding its own election commitments and allocate the required amount of funds to finish the project within five years? The coalition has been defeated in three successive federal elections in the always marginal electorate of Bendigo, with its dishonest treatment of the Calder Highway construction being one of the main contributing factors. It is time the coalition stopped playing dangerous games and honoured its commitments to central Victoria. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>48</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to follow the member for Bendigo in speaking on the<inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline>, because alongside the member for Bendigo I feel pretty angry about the treatment of our regional communities by this government under AusLink, and about the way road funding projects in our district have been treated under AusLink during the election. We also feel pretty angry about some of the untruths that were told during the election campaign about what AusLink was going to deliver to our communities, because the reality is very different.</para></talk.start><para>Roads are vital to our communities and to our economy. Coming from the regional electorate of Ballarat I know how important it is for regional economies and communities to have a comprehensive national strategy for our roads and highways. The adequacy of roads has a direct impact on the wellbeing and wealth of our regions and our nation. As members in this House are probably aware, the funding of national highways has been of particular concern to me since I became the member for Ballarat.</para><para>The Western Highway runs right through the heart of my electorate. It is the principle road link between Melbourne and Adelaide and it is the lifeblood of the state. Each day it carries more than 40,000 vehicles between Melbourne and Ballarat and up to 4,000 between Ballarat and the South Australian border. The highway connects regional centres through western and northern Victoria and plays a key role in linking more remote communities to regional hubs. In terms of freight the Western Highway is the second busiest national highway in Australia, second only to the Hume. With over five million tonnes of interstate freight movement annually, it carries around 4,000 commercial vehicles per day between Ballarat and Melbourne and over 1,000 per day between Ballarat and the South Australian border.</para><para>Freight movement along the Western Highway includes steel from Whyalla and Western Port; wool, meat, fruit and vegetables from Adelaide and Western Australia; grape juice and wine to and from South Australia; manufactured goods, particularly car components, from western Victoria to Adelaide and to my electorate in central Victoria—the list of goods goes on. When you consider that the government's forecasts estimate that from 2000 to 2020 non-bulk road freight will double and interstate road freight will multiply at an even greater rate, it becomes clear that we need a far reaching, coherent and comprehensive plan for our national transport network.</para><para>When the government released its AusLink white paper it promised to develop a strategic approach to our long-term future transport needs across the country. AusLink is the principle means by which the government will fund Australia's national transport infrastructure, and I welcome the additional funding that is contained within it. However, I am disappointed that AusLink and the Howard government have retreated from their responsibilities to fully fund national highways and have prepared the way for a disjointed, stagnating and highly politicised funding process.</para><para>Division 1 of the AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004 has the potential to make funding captive to the electoral needs of the Howard government rather than the needs of the wider community. Division 1 provides the minister with considerable discretion. This potentially, given the Howard government's form on Regional Partnerships, enables the Howard government to target electorates on the basis of their margin—whether they want to win them, whether they want to hold them or whether they owe favours to their National Party mates—with funding throughout an election cycle. We are living in a time when taxpayers are demanding more value for their taxes and wanting greater transparency from their governments. It is therefore extraordinary that clause 11 of this bill does not even compel the minister to make a cost-benefit analysis on funding programs under AusLink. It is absolutely unbelievable that funding decisions are not going to be made on a cost-benefit basis. If we stopped the ordinary person in the street and asked whether they would give a large sum of money to a builder to do some work on their house, work which they could not quite specify and for which they had not done any economic analysis to see whether it would benefit the property owner or not, they would say, `You must be absolutely joking. That is a ridiculous way of spending money.' Unfortunately, the Howard government is not joking on this issue. </para><para>It is a matter of trust. Do you trust the Howard government not to play politics with federal road funding? After what we have seen with Regional Partnerships the answer has to be: absolutely not. My electorate has had firsthand experience of the Howard government putting political considerations above those of developing a consistent and coherent national transport network. The decision to fully fund the Geelong bypass over the Deer Park bypass in the midst of an election year is a perfect example of putting politics over the national interest. The Deer Park bypass of the Western Highway, a national highway, was fully the responsibility of the Commonwealth government and it had the highest cost-benefit ratio of any project in Victoria. Treasurer Costello in the 2001 election campaign acknowledged that it was the highest priority and said they would fund it immediately when funds become available. What had changed by 2004? Suddenly, the seat of Corangamite came into play; they were a bit nervous about it. Suddenly the Geelong bypass became the highest priority for the federal government.</para><para>As I have informed this place on a previous occasion, commuters in my electorate have been waiting for years for this government to commit the full $294 million required for the construction of the Deer Park bypass. Labor was prepared to step up to the plate and, despite the government's failure, we promised we would fully fund $294 million to build the Deer Park bypass. It is of great regret to me that, had we won the election, that road would have commenced by now. The start date under Labor was 2005-06—it would have started this year. We now see that this government's commitment is totally inadequate and we have not seen a single sod of dirt turned to get this road built.</para><para>The announcement that the Treasurer made in relation to AusLink only delivered $40 million for a $294 million project. On closer inspection, it is not only $40 million for a $294 million project but the project is not to start this year or next year but after the next federal election in 2007-08 and 2008-09, with no further commitments for funding given. The first statement of AusLink says that future funding will be sought from the state government. Then, in an extraordinary back flip in our local newspaper, after the state government said this was a national highway and was fully the responsibility of the Commonwealth to fund, we suddenly hear that they might find some money in future budgets. There is absolutely no statement within the AusLink white paper, no commitment or guarantee given, that any money other than the $40 million to come into play in 2007-08, after the next federal election, will even be given. Forty million dollars is not even enough to start doing the edges and the guttering around where the Deer Park bypass has to go. You cannot even start a $294 million project unless you know you have the money to finish it. Labor promised it during the election campaign. As I said, it is a great regret to me that we did not win, because we would have started building that road this year. </para><para>Like all announcements of the government, the devil was in the detail—$40 million to commence a $294 million project which the government was 100 per cent responsible for building. The Deer Park bypass has been used as a political football by the Howard government, and AusLink does absolutely nothing to guarantee that we will have the funding to complete it, let alone actually get it started. This is a road, again, that had the highest cost-benefit ratio of any of the road projects in Victoria. It is unbelievable to me that the government was able to fully fund Geelong when Geelong was not even on the radar screen two years ago but was not able to fund Deer Park. The gaping funding gap that now exists for the Deer Park bypass is an example of the Howard government's failure to accept its responsibility for Australia's national land transport network. Gone is the Commonwealth's full responsibility for the construction and maintenance of the national highway network. There is $12 billion worth of road and rail projects and not a cost-benefit ratio to be found. To borrow a headline from the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>, this bill well and truly puts politics in the driving seat.</para><para>The Howard government has retreated from the 100 per cent funding of our national highways, and the inclusion of a project in the network does not mean that the community will receive its road. Our national highways will now have to rely on local councils and state governments to enter into partnerships, possibly with private companies, to build improvements to roads such as the Western Highway. This opens up the possibility of only being able to get our road finished and funded via a partnership that would essentially mean road tolls. I find it unbelievable that the government stands here and criticises the decision that tolls need to go on the Scoresby to get that road built when this bill opens up the possibility that the only way that communities along national highways will get the funding to get projects built is potentially via tolls. It is completely inconsistent policy on the part of the government.</para><para>The Howard government's idea of a partnership is drastically different from the conventional understanding of one. It is unclear how events will unfold. States have clearly been left out of the negotiations in developing the details of the land transport network and will now be asked to pick up the shortfall in funding. AusLink was parachuted onto the desks of state ministers and they were basically told to cop it or go away.</para><para>Under AusLink, projects are imposed on state governments with only a part-funding, scattergun approach from the Howard government. The states are left to pick up the tab for the remainder. AusLink has created more uncertainty than ever about how transport infrastructure is built and maintained. Professor Fred Affleck, Director of the Planning and Transport Research Centre at Monash University, gave a pretty balanced assessment of AusLink. He said:</para><quote><para>There is still a very large role for the States and Territories, local government and the private sector, which is clearly expected to take on an expanded role.</para><para>But there are still no agreed mechanisms for coordinating planning and implementation to join up the gaps between these four frames of the big picture of integration. This could be serious. The Commonwealth can't go it alone, or expect others to fill in the blanks it has left in this picture ... </para></quote><para>AusLink is not the grand national land transport plan that it purports to be. It is not a cooperative approach to transport infrastructure funding; it is buck-passing on a grand scale. State governments were largely ignored during the drafting of AusLink and now they are expected to do their bit. There are no longer clear lines of responsibility between the Commonwealth and state governments. Instead, we now have AusLink corridors with a freight focus imposed by Canberra with a take it or leave it funding arrangement attitude for state and local governments.</para><para>What is required for our national infrastructure is exactly what the government is not delivering. The starting point should be the establishment of a national advisory committee with the states and territories, comprising consumers and experts. This process would be inclusive and open and would also ensure that cost-benefit analyses are done on the road projects to be funded. Again, while I welcome the additional $1.053 billion of funding, I am concerned that the Howard government has further politicised an already political process. The lack of cooperation with the state governments may lead to many projects being delayed or, even worse, cancelled altogether. More generally, I feel the Howard government is showing signs of increasing arrogance and contempt. The government is becoming increasingly secretive and more political when developing public policy of this nature.</para><para>Sometimes politicians can forget the very real effect their decisions can have on the people out there trying to raise a family or get to work each day. I received an email this morning—it was a pretty timely one and one not solicited by me—from a constituent who had just driven down the Western Highway to work. She is one of the commuters who commute from my electorate each day to Melbourne. She was extremely angry about the decision of the Howard government to fund the Geelong bypass at the expense of the Deer Park bypass. The email reads:</para><quote><para>Dear Catherine, it was with amusement I saw on the news last night that the Geelong Bypass is going to be funded. Yet again “the haves” win over “the have nots”. As I was driving down the western highway today I felt reasonably resentful, that there may never be a deer park bypass. I have even considered taking the sticker off my car. I don't know why I am even having a reaction of course little Johnny is going to look after his mates first. This is an obvious sign of things to come. The only joy I will get out of the next three years is when people realise what a dictator this man is, to be able to point and say but you voted for him did you not! Good luck Catherine ... Keep those people accountable please. Regards Liz</para></quote><para>I certainly intend to keep the government accountable and I certainly intend to keep the government accountable about the Deer Park bypass. Not a day will go by when I will not raise this issue either in my local media or in the House. This is a vital piece of infrastructure for these communities—not just for Ballarat but for all the communities along the Western Highway from the South Australian border all the way to Melbourne. It is the second busiest freight route in the country and it is ridiculous that a project of this nature could not have been funded by the government.</para><para>During the election campaign we had that rather pathetic announcement by the government of $40 million after the next federal election—in 2007-08—to commence the Deer Park bypass. The AusLink plan, as I said, originally said that the state governments had to find the shortfall of funding. States have budgets too. Suddenly, for a $294 million project that had been the full responsibility of the Commonwealth to fund, because they had responsibility for national highways, the state governments were told, `Well, you're going to have to make up the shortfall if this road is going to get built.' Quite rightly, the Victorian Minister for Transport said that the state government could not assist the Commonwealth to build a road that was 100 per cent a Commonwealth responsibility, and that, whilst it was a major priority for the state government, it had not been on their budget because it was a national highway for which the Commonwealth had responsibility. </para><para>After the state government said, `We can't fund this road; it is your responsibility to fund it,' in an absolute backflip we then had the roads minister saying, `Well, we won't seek funding from the state government'—despite the fact that that is exactly what this bill requires—`but it will be subject to future Commonwealth budgets; we'll think about it as we go along.' So, one day the Deer Park bypass was the responsibility of the Commonwealth; the next day it suddenly became Commonwealth-state, then the Commonwealth said, `We'll take over responsibility for it again.' On the day of the announcement of AusLink we had the Treasurer grinning down in Geelong. He would not have dared to come near my seat or that of the member for Bendigo.</para><para>I have to say I think the Liberal candidates for both Ballarat and Bendigo made an incredible mistake by going down to Geelong for the announcement to watch the roads and their communities basically get dudded, and by being photographed beside a grinning Treasurer dudding the communities of Ballarat and Bendigo. He would not have dared come near the community of Ballarat at that point, because we were furious, and the reaction from the Ballarat community and from the Western Highway Action Committee, which represents all the councils along the Western Highway, was immediate. We said to the government very clearly: `This is not a promise; you have dudded us with this. This is absolutely not what we were expecting.' Labor came to the party a week later and said: `We're not going to muck around with this. We're not going to drag this out any more. We're going to put our cards on the table. This road is too important to play politics with. We're going to fund it fully—100 per cent, $294 million—to start this financial year.' As I said, unfortunately that has not been a reality.</para><para>The reaction of the community was huge; it was absolutely enormous. The front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> absolutely slammed the government for their decision. During this period of uncertainty by the government we saw a display of complete arrogance by the Liberal Party. The previous member for Ballarat, Michael Ronaldson, who is now a senator elect and will be coming to this place shortly, had the temerity to label the reaction of the local community. You have to remember that this is a project they had been working on for years and years and it suddenly got dudded when they thought they were just going to get over the line on it. The senator elect wrote a letter to the local <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> saying that the local reaction to the announcement was a `dummy spit' and that the community of Ballarat needed to grow up. That is unbelievable from a senator elect who is purporting to represent this area.</para><para>Senator elect Ronaldson called those who were objecting to the inadequate decision `rank amateurs'—what an affront to the Western Highway Action Committee, who have been fighting for this project for years and who have been very careful to be apolitical in their approach. But they know when they are being sold a dud and it was absolutely incumbent upon them—and they are not all of my political persuasion, I can absolutely guarantee that—to raise this issue publicly. They raised it publicly, they expressed their anger and Senator elect Michael Ronaldson said to them in the local newspaper, `You're having a dummy-spit and you're rank amateurs.' It was a complete affront to the Western Highway Action Committee—all of those local mayors down in that area who represent the constituencies along that highway—and to all the commuters from Ballarat, Bacchus Marsh, Gordon and Ballan. </para><para>If the experience of the Deer Park bypass is anything to go by then AusLink will do nothing to assure that the construction of this bypass will happen. In fact, it will make it even less likely that it will happen. I say to all those communities, rural and regional, who live along a national highway: take a good look at what this bill has done in terms of your road funding project for national highways. It has put an enormous burden on you as a local community through your council and an enormous burden on your state governments to fund road projects along national highways, a burden that should rightly be the responsibility of the Commonwealth government, because, after all, you would think that the Commonwealth government should have the responsibility for the national highway network between our major capital cities. The Western Highway is the major highway between Melbourne and Adelaide and is the second busiest freight route, but this bill absolutely duds all the communities along the Western Highway, and it makes the Deer Park bypass even less of a reality.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>53</page.no><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name><name.id>YU5</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> before the parliament today is dedicated to implementing the government's long-awaited AusLink strategy, the land transport strategy that is designed to provide the framework for the government's involvement in road and rail and the future infrastructure needs in these two very important transport sectors. It is, in fact, a rather large blueprint for even more National Party pork-barrelling and it is setting a framework for the government into the future to even further politicise the use of infrastructure spending, particularly road funding, for the purpose of entrenching the government's position in marginal, regional seats.</para></talk.start><para>In spite of the fact that we have a long overdue national land transport plan being presented to the parliament, there are major deficiencies with the proposals that the government is putting forward that really do need to be addressed. There are some good aspects to the AusLink strategy; in particular, the step being taken towards much greater mode neutrality between road and rail is an extremely important step for our nation. For too long we have had a tug of war between road and rail, usually at the expense of rail, and, particularly when it comes to a rational freight strategy for our nation, there have been inadequate answers and strategies for these challenges for far too long. So it is good to see that we are taking major steps towards neutrality of funding and neutrality of planning and strategy with respect to road and rail.</para><para>There are major weaknesses in our interstate road network, but there are still enormous problems with our interstate rail network. In spite of the many fantasies that have been floated from time to time about great new projects of national vision, such as very fast trains, there is still no question that the primary task in rail transport in this country is to bring our national network up to scratch to deal with some of the major gaps and some of the huge problems, particularly around Sydney, that have yet to be fully addressed.</para><para>In an era of growing crisis with respect to infrastructure all around Australia, this AusLink strategy fails the test of economic efficiency. It fails the test of rational allocation of scarce resources. It fails the test of objective criteria designed to ensure that scarce resources go to the areas of greatest need, where the cost-benefit ratios for the nation are at their highest. </para><para>The key element of this is that the government is withdrawing from the previous role established by the Hawke government in 1991 in its major reforms to land transport funding—that is, from the full funding and maintenance of the national highway system. That was a very important reform, for which credit belongs also to the then New South Wales Liberal government of Nick Greiner for supporting it. It was a very important reform in ensuring that some degree of rationality and economic efficiency emerged in our system of road funding in Australia. The government is taking a very important step towards unravelling that reform and diminishing the federal government's responsibility for the national highway system, in order to shift the focus more towards Roads of National Importance and road funding that is partly funded by the states.</para><para>The government is also introducing a discretionary fund for strategic regional projects. As recent events indicate, that is simply code for a slush fund that can be doled out, particularly prior to election campaigns, in order to assist National Party candidates to hold and to win marginal seats. It is entirely obvious what this particular component of the AusLink strategy is about. It is simply to enable further pork-barrelling by the National Party in particular—the Liberal Party in some areas but mostly the National Party—in order to maximise their political position. That might seem like a smart political strategy on the part of the government. It may even have some slight impact politically—who knows? But it is bad for the nation. It is bad for the nation's economy. It is bad for our future as a society if scarce dollars are being misused, are being allocated for reasons other than need and for reasons other than economic efficiency and cost-benefit ratio analysis of road funding.</para><para>In my remarks, I want to focus on the infamous Roads of National Importance program, which was introduced in 1996 and which, as shadow transport minister, I dubbed the `roads of National Party importance', I think with every justification. In 1996, the Howard government introduced the new structure of road funding, which was predicated on substantial cuts in the projected budget for the national highway system and on the introduction of Roads of National Importance. That program was designed around the federal government going to the states and offering, fifty-fifty, to fund major road upgrades or new roads, based on the states submitting bids and the Commonwealth ultimately making the decision as to where the money would be dedicated.</para><para>Gradually, since that period, the proportion of road funding that has been allocated to Roads of National Importance has steadily increased. At the same time, the relative priority given to the national highway system has diminished. In the 1996-97 financial year, the allocation to Roads of National Importance was around $90 million, and by 2001-02 that amount had grown to $253 million. Over that period, there was a significant deterioration in the national highway commitment as well.</para><para>The criteria published by the Department of Transport and Regional Services with respect to Roads of National Importance are deliberately vague, very general, and they also unashamedly note that priority will be given to the fulfilment of the government's election commitments in determining whether or not a particular road should be funded. So not only do you start with a set of criteria that are so vague and general that almost any road could potentially qualify but also, quite explicitly, on top of those criteria, you have an acknowledgment that government election commitments will take priority in decisions about which road should be funded. In other words, forget about rational criteria, forget about economic efficiency, forget about the nation's infrastructure needs; the Howard government's approach to road funding is entirely politicised and deliberately intended to foster the prospects of candidates winning seats at the expense of a rational and economically efficient allocation of funding for the nation's infrastructure needs. </para><para>It is interesting to look over that period at the list of Roads of National Importance projects to see where the money has gone. An extraordinary preponderance of funding has gone to Queensland and New South Wales. It just so happens, of course, that the National Party is basically a two-state party these days. Guess which states? Queensland and New South Wales. It has two seats left in Victoria. When the incumbents of those seats move on, it is almost inevitable that the Liberal Party—and possibly Labor, in the case of Gippsland—will win those seats, and the National Party will be shrunk back to purely a two-state party. Of course, a very substantial proportion of these Roads of National Importance projects are in marginal National Party seats. There is a clear bias that shines through. When you add the criteria to the actuality of what has happened with the funding, you can see very clearly what is going on here. The road funding program of the Commonwealth is being used deliberately for political purposes.</para><para>There are some outstanding examples to illustrate how absurd the process of road funding has become. My favourite has always been Main Road 92, which has been allocated a decision as a road of national importance for something like six or seven years, but nothing has happened, for various reasons I will not go into. Perhaps the reason that nothing has happened is that the seat the road is in was once a marginal Liberal seat but has now become relatively secure, and therefore there is no longer any need to spend any money in it. Main Road 92 would have to be one of the less significant roads in Australia—certainly not the kind of road that you would expect should qualify for federal funding when you consider some of the major, vital, economic, arterial roads that do not qualify for federal funding and do not get Roads of National Importance funding. That is particularly so when you consider that the plan to upgrade Main Road 92—it is in the seat of Gilmore, which is south of Sydney—explicitly acknowledges that in some parts it will remain relatively narrow and winding and not particularly accessible. That is because of the incursion of a national park and because there is a historic bluestone wall there from the time when it was a major wool route—a very long time ago, going back I think to 1856—and for these reasons it will not be possible to turn it into a seriously major road.</para><para>Once again you have a blatant pork-barrel exercise that was designed to improve the electoral prospects of the member for Gilmore, with no real connection to any serious sense of priorities about road funding or any real connection with the major economic interests of the nation. You can apply the same kind of assessment to other roads. The Mount Morgan to Kabra road in the seat of Hinkler, for example, is clearly a less significant road in economic terms than many other major arterial roads throughout the nation, yet it is on the Roads of National Importance list.</para><para>The overall picture is that the Howard government is relentlessly playing politics with infrastructure. It is ignoring cost-benefit ratios, which are a useful if not absolute guide to the likely economic value of investing in a particular road project as opposed to any other; it is ignoring economic efficiency; and it is ignoring the nation's needs. As a result, we are seeing the gradual accumulation of infrastructure problems and bottlenecks and the slow deterioration of our export performance—all of which are eating away at Australia's medium-term economic prospects. This is partly because the Howard government focuses on playing politics with infrastructure spending. </para><para>The government is spending quite substantial amounts of money for inadequate returns—road funding being the classic example. It is all about ensuring that conservative members get to cut the ribbon and that conservative members are on the front page of the local paper with the upgrade or the new road; it is not about ensuring that the nation's needs are met or that the infrastructure needs of Australia are being addressed.</para><para>Meanwhile, when we do confront the question of our inadequate infrastructure performance in this nation, the response of the government is to attack state governments. The response of the Howard government is to say, `It is nothing really to do with us.' The fact is that our exports are deteriorating substantially. Our non-commodity exports of manufactured items and services in particular have deteriorated substantially since about the turn of the century. Over the past four or five years they have dropped substantially as a percentage of our total GDP.</para><para>When hit with this criticism, the Howard government answers that it is all the fault of state governments because they are in charge of infrastructure. That is wrong. The state governments in some cases will bear some responsibility, but it is the Howard government that has wasted so much money on so much frippery, on so much rubbish. Going back to the Centenary of Federation fund, the Natural Heritage Trust, Networking the Nation and in this case road funding, the government has wasted so much of taxpayers' money on things that are politically driven and deliver inadequate benefits for the nation and inadequate returns for our economy. Now the chickens are coming home to roost and road funding is one of those areas where it is occurring.</para><para>We have very serious infrastructure problems in Australia. We have had decades of neglect of our rail system, and some of those major problems are yet to be resolved. We have problems with the state and federal interface in rail, particularly with respect to New South Wales and Queensland. There has been some progress, but still we have no adequate solution.</para><para>Port connections with road and rail are inadequate in many cases. If you look at what has been happening in the road funding area, you will see instances such as the Pacific Highway upgrade, which, from memory, is due to finish in 2016. Clearly a higher priority should be given to that commitment to ensure that we have dual carriageway all the way between Sydney and Brisbane well before 2016. They are the kinds of problems we have, particularly in the transport end of infrastructure in Australia.</para><para>While those problems are languishing, while they are not being adequately addressed, the Howard government is frittering away money, time after time, on little pork-barrel projects, regional grants and Networking the Nation. All of these things are designed to make it look as though the government is actually doing something. They are designed to appeal to a few particular local interests and make them think that they are being looked after, while the nation's economy and its underpinning economic structure gradually deteriorate. That will come home to roost sooner than people anticipate. </para><para>There has been a complete lack of imagination with respect to dealing with the prospective role of public-private partnerships, which could be playing a much more significant role in dealing with the nation's infrastructure needs. The continuing use of federal-state tensions as an excuse for inaction or for failing to address the real problems in infrastructure is another scandal. It is always about buck-passing and blame shifting and never about tackling the nation's problems; it is just playing politics.</para><para>We cannot afford the inefficiencies that flow from these political indulgences anymore. Our economy is still ticking over at a good growth rate, but what we are not doing is setting in place the foundations for continuing strong future growth. As the capacity constraints that are now becoming obvious start to cut in, we will face a period of considerable economic pain in this country as we start to make major adjustments to the investments that should have been occurring over the past five to 10 years. They have not been occurring partly because a lot of the money that could have been dedicated to those kinds of investments has been frittered away in political pork-barrelling.</para><para>AusLink started life as a good idea. I acknowledge that substantial elements of this strategy are still worth supporting, especially the concept of integrating the national approach to road and rail. That is a very important first step. Inevitably it has potentially been corrupted by the Howard government's political games and use of pork-barrelling as a political strategy; nonetheless, it is a good first step. It is difficult to take further. We have to acknowledge that it is not easy to take that step further, particularly with the state-federal division and the inherent tension between road and rail; nonetheless, it is a very good start.</para><para>It is time that we moved beyond the lack of clear lines of responsibility and accountability and invested in projects that are of economic benefit to the nation. It is also time that we got genuinely serious about rail. I have concentrated mostly in my comments on the question of roads and Roads of National of Importance in particular, but I want to make a couple of observations about the role of rail in Australia.</para><para>About seven or eight years ago, early in the Howard government, we had what was then advertised as a giant rail reform program put forward by the Howard government. This involved privatising Australia National, selling different components of it, integrating the track with the Australian Rail Track Corporation and various other things. This was trumpeted as a $2 billion rail reform program. The inevitably gullible media swallowed this slogan whole. In fact, the amount of new spending involved was roughly $50 million, not $2 billion. The $2 billion figure included such absurdities as counting the fact that the Commonwealth had to take on board about $800 million worth of superannuation liabilities from Australia National, which it would have always been implicitly liable for in any event.</para><para>For many, many years, the rail sector in this country has been characterised by dilapidated track, speed restrictions in many areas, inability to double-stack containers, substantial delays and overall poor efficiency. Some progress has been made, and there have been some positive consequences of the changes that the Howard government made seven or eight years ago. For example, the time of the overland between Melbourne and Adelaide has diminished significantly. That has had a positive impact on patronage, and that is a good thing. There are still significant problems on the Melbourne to Brisbane leg—particularly dealing with congestion in Sydney—and, although the ARTC has done a difficult job very well, there are still major areas that need to be addressed. If we are serious about rail reform, transport reform and fixing the infrastructure problems that are starting to bedevil our economy, fixing rail has to be a very high priority—not flirting with projects of national vision, like steel equivalents of canals, very fast trains and all the other kinds of things that occasionally surface, but just getting the existing network up to scratch, economically efficient and doing a good job. Some progress has been made, but there is a lot more to be done. </para><para>The AusLink concept has been good initially, but it needs to be separated from misuse: misuse through petty party politics, misuse through pork-barrelling and misuse by National Party candidates in particular being seen to be delivering the goods to their local areas irrespective of the overall economic needs of the nation. Australia is more dependent on land transport than most countries. It is time we had genuine, rigorous reform and genuine investment in the projects that will improve the overall performance of the network and the overall economic outcomes that we all depend upon from our land transport network—not more short-term political gains. There is a big challenge for Labor in dealing with these issues, because we will have to clean up the mess. We will be the ones who have to get rigour, economic efficiency and objectivity into the funding of the nation's land transport infrastructure in the wake of the politically driven mess that is being created by the Howard government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>58</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Gorton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to comment upon the <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> and <inline ref="R2237">AusLink (National Land Transport—Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004</inline> and to reflect upon the motives that have driven the government to allocate money in the way they have over the last term and beyond. It seems to me, and it has been reflected in comments by my Labor colleagues—including two former shadow ministers for transport and the current shadow minister for transport—that AusLink as a notion is something worth supporting. However, there has not been the political will by the government to properly fulfil the notion in practice.</para></talk.start><para>I am happy to rise after the contributions by the members for Ballarat and Bendigo, because their electorates share with mine concerns with the Deer Park bypass, which is attached to the Western Highway. The member for Ballarat raised the issue of the Western Highway being properly attended to. The Western Highway runs all way through my electorate, and the other important transport spine in Victoria, the Calder, runs from Bendigo through my electorate down to Melbourne. Those two important highways in Victoria have indeed been neglected. Whilst there have been some winners as a result of the AusLink program announced by the Deputy Prime Minister before the election, there are definitely some losers. Unfortunately, the constituents of Gorton, Ballarat and Bendigo are amongst those losers. I rise to express disappointment on behalf of the many thousands of people who will continue to be inconvenienced as a result of the lack of commitment to construct the Deer Park bypass in western Melbourne.</para><para>To explain for those who do not know how important it is to that region, as the member for Ballarat has indicated, the Deer Park bypass was a critical piece of infrastructure that would allow for proper travel between not only Ballarat and Melbourne through my electorate but also Melbourne and Adelaide—a very important transport link indeed. As indicated earlier in the debate, it carries the second largest amount of freight after the Hume Highway and has enormous traffic in terms of both freight and commuters. With respect to the concerns that are raised in my electorate in terms of the need for the Deer Park bypass, we have major congestion and safety issues. In Deer Park, Caroline Springs, Burnside and those suburbs, the Western Highway in peak hour effectively converts to a car park. The movement of traffic slows to a crawl for a couple of hours in the morning and the late afternoon as a result of that congestion. If anyone understands the growth corridors of Melbourne in the west—and it is my hope that the government does—they will know this ensures that these problems will be compounded, because my electorate and a little beyond my region is the fastest growing area of Victoria. We have suburbs like Caroline Springs that did not exist six years ago, and now 15,000 people live there. There is exponential growth in those areas along the Western Highway, as there has been for some time along the Calder, which really demands some attention in the area of transport. </para><para>These areas are not wealthy areas; they are home to decent hard working Australians who deserve to get their fair allocation of transport resources as much as anyone else and more so now because they have been neglected for so long. I am sick and tired of seeing the government worry about the marginals; they might want to start worrying about the marginalised. The constituents of my electorate have felt marginalised in many services. Transport is top of the heap when it comes to the important things that the Commonwealth could do for my electorate.</para><para>As indicated earlier, Labor had given a commitment to fund fully the $294 million required to commence the construction of the Deer Park bypass. That would have commenced possibly later this year. Certainly, there was a commitment to commence it in the next 12 months or so and we would have had some idea when that important transport infrastructure would be complete. As it is now, the government has given an undertaking to put up $80 million of that $294 million, but with no time frame for the balance—the almost 75 per cent more—required to fund the Deer Park bypass. So it is not just a question of Labor committing to the bypass and the government committing to a later date. The commitment we made was that we would build it. Unfortunately, I cannot give any guarantee to my constituents that it will ever be built whilst this government is in office. That disappoints me because there is a dire need and it will be an increasing need as the population grows in the region. I hope the government attends to that quickly.</para><para>As was also indicated, I think by the member for Ballarat, it was amazing how quickly the government responded to the need for the Geelong bypass. No-one doubts the concerns that Geelong has and the need for that bypass but independent commentators and third-party authorities on transport in Victoria or indeed nationally—every authority that I have come across—indicate that the Western Highway was the priority for Victoria. What we saw was the Treasurer and the Prime Minister playing politics over public policy. We saw them putting the interests of the country ahead of the efficiencies and the transport needs to strengthen our economy. We saw them putting those priorities behind the electoral needs of the government. That is something, I think, that people are sick and tired of.</para><para>With respect to the Calder, there are some works, which are as important but far less expensive, that the government has failed to commit to. As the member for Bendigo has indicated we still have not seen the completion of the freeway from Melbourne to Bendigo. He is quite right to raise in this place again the concerns of those people in Bendigo—indeed, of anyone between Bendigo and Melbourne and beyond who uses the highway to get to and from their home, place of business and so on. He has raised those concerns. I would like to raise a number of concerns that impact directly upon my electorate. </para><para>There are a couple of unsafe intersections that cut across the Calder in Taylors Lakes and in Keilor. Robertsons Road was never meant to intersect with a freeway but it currently intersects with the Calder. As a result, we have had many fatalities and injuries at that intersection that should not have occurred. What was supposed to occur was that two other roads, Sunshine Avenue and Kings Road, were to have proper intersections so that people could safely exit and enter the freeway. As a result of the money not being forthcoming from the Commonwealth, we have not seen any work on those intersections. There is no doubt in my mind that we have seen tragic fatalities as a consequence.</para><para>Only last week, I met with a local who lives on Robertsons Road. His house is the closest house to the intersection with the Calder. He has had to come out on numerous occasions to find absolute carnage as a result of completely avoidable accidents if the Commonwealth were doing its job. He has found injured and deceased travellers as a result of that very dangerous intersection that abuts the Calder. It is indeed a RONI. I have to say that the member for Bendigo was correct when he said there are RONIs and RONIs-come-lately. The RONIs-come-lately—that is, those that sit in other perhaps marginal electorates that the government is interested in—seem to get attention before the ones with most need. In relation to these intersections on the Calder, I have written to the state government to ask for its assistance in ensuring the construction of safe intersections for Sunshine Avenue and Kings Road. The state government has given a commitment to half fund that work.</para><para>Originally I sought, as should be the case, full funding for those intersections, but now I seek funding to match the state government funding for those intersections. They are critical and the failure to construct these proper intersections is causing fatalities and injuries. The sum of money in transport costs is infinitesimal when compared with the tragedy that besets the families of these victims as a result of the failure of governments to respond.</para><para>I have had a commitment from the Victorian state government to fix the Kings Road interchange and associated access interchanges and to pay half the cost. What I ask of the federal government—and I will be seeking a meeting with the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads to talk about this critical issue—is to have the Commonwealth match the state government funding so that we can prevent any further unnecessary fatalities. I am not suggesting that transport accidents will not occur as a result of the improvements—of course they will. People make errors but they are more likely to make errors that lead to death or injury when roads are unsafe. I can assure you that living where I do very close to those intersections—I use them almost every day when I am in my electorate—they are unsafe and they are causing injury and death. The amount of money required to fix them is not large. It is therefore a travesty to see the constituents of my electorate treated in such a shabby manner and with such obvious disregard for the western suburbs of Melbourne. I beseech the government to respond to my concerns on this matter.</para><para>I hope that the government does reconsider the way it allocates its resources in the area of transport. There must be some capacity for governments to allocate money based on need and on the importance of the transport link and to try to remove the politics that goes on in this area. I know there is a great temptation—and other speakers have raised the issue of money coming from nowhere all of a sudden—to fund the transport needs of a marginal seat, but that is just not good enough. The constituents of my electorate deserve as much support as any others, and it should not be based on their margin as a voting body. It must be based on their needs. It must be based on the economic needs of the nation in the macro sense and certainly it should be based on removing danger and increasing the safety of travel at the local level. That seems to be a failing that I have witnessed. I do not pretend to be an expert in transport, but I do know, however, that the western suburbs of Melbourne have been in receipt of very little money from this government. </para><para>When third parties like VicRoads and the RACV have mentioned the absolutely dire need for improvements to the Calder Freeway and to the Western Highway, it has fallen on deaf ears. I ask the government to reconsider the way it has applied the funding to date; otherwise—and I do not like to dramatise these things but there is no doubt in my mind—there will be deaths that will be attributable to the failure of Commonwealth policy, or indeed any government's policy, where the needs of traffic users have been put second to the electoral interests of the government, which has the power to make decisions to allocate resources. To me there is something quite immoral about the capacity for decision makers to think that their electoral interests are more important than those of people who need improved safety on the roads. I ask the government to reconsider those things. I hope there can be a mechanism, as the member for Melbourne said, by which we can allocate resources on an efficient and economic basis rather than on one that is perceived to be a pork-barrelling basis. We are a vast country with a small population. We cannot afford to waste our limited dollars on an approach that is inefficient and not based on need.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>61</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2237">AusLink (National Land Transport—Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004</inline>. I want to add my voice to the many we have heard in the parliament on these very important bills, and in particular I want to give my support to the comments of the member for Wills, who has responsibility for the carriage of this bill for the opposition. I concur with his second reading amendment, which asks the House to call upon the government to:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	maintain funding responsibility for construction and maintenance of infrastructure on what was formerly defined as the National Highway Network;</para><para>(2)	establish a National Infrastructure Advisory Council; and</para><para>(3)	extend the criteria for Roads to Recovery projects to include public transport, cycling, walking infrastructure and regional airport runways”.</para><para>It is important to note Labor's view of these bills. We agree with the fundamental principle that the Commonwealth government needs to play a role in Australia's future land transport needs. It needs to do that using a coordinated approach and with a long-term commitment to those issues. We also need to have an approach that is based on commonsense and good planning. However, what we have seen is AusLink, proposed by the Howard government, which is nothing of the sort. AusLink is woefully inadequate. The government should be turning its full attention to the national land transport plan, and there is a lot of evidence that points to that need. If we look at the economic figures and data, at what the Treasurer has been saying in the last few weeks, at comments by the Reserve Bank of Australia and at reports by the OECD and so forth, we see that they point to a need for Australia to invest in the future through infrastructure. There is this great need because of the lack of spending on infrastructure over recent decades. </para><para>AusLink is not a nation building piece of legislation. In fact it is not in this nation's best interest to carry out all or some of the parts contained in it. It is in essence a pork-barrelling exercise in the finest traditions of this government and in particular of the National Party. You will not get any arguments from the National Party members about that actually being the case because they will often tell you how proud they are of their initiatives in this area. Above all it is a national disgrace, and the people of Australia deserve better from the national government. It should represent all people in all electorates, regardless of state boundaries or local government boundaries. If it is truly to be a nationally significant program—and it is often referred to by the Deputy Prime Minister as being somewhat equivalent to the Snowy Mountains Scheme—then it truly should be national. It should be based on principles of fairness and equity, on principles of delivering for this country's future.</para><para>If you were to take a map and colour code that map to show where funding will actually be going, if you were to take a green pen, a red pen and a blue pen and started highlighting where money will be going, you would find very little red and you would find a little bit of blue but you would find a hell of a lot of green in all the National Party areas. Instead of getting some national leadership from the government on some agreed priorities we see a piece of legislation that seeks to achieve what the government believe are political objectives, which is an agreement between the Liberal and National parties. The allocation of funds, rather than being based on sound principles of a nation's need, is based on the old-fashioned principles of pork-barrelling.</para><para>The Australian Labor Party, on the other hand, has a long tradition of delivering great outcomes in respect of the nation's infrastructure needs. The Australian Labor Party also has a long tradition of ensuring growth and productivity for the Australian economy. You would not have to look too far in recent weeks to hear the talk about strong economic growth—14 consecutive years of economic growth. That economic growth has not been built in the last nine years, when this government has been in, but was actually delivered and built upon for the future by the Hawke and Keating governments during the 1980s and the 1990s. I feel we have not spoken enough about this, and the Labor Party is not given credit for it. Those tough economic reforms and decisions made under those two governments, the Hawke and Keating governments, have paved the way for future governments, in particular the Howard government, to be able to enjoy the fruits of that economic reform, to enjoy the economic good times that it now has. Nobody with a commonsense approach could possibly say that 14 consecutive years of economic growth were somehow delivered miraculously in the last few years by this government. They were not. The foundations and the grounding were built during the eighties and the nineties.</para><para>What concerns me more than the historic perspective is the failure of this government to do something constructive and positive with those 14 consecutive years of economic growth. It has failed to invest in our future. It has failed to invest in infrastructure. It has failed to invest fully to capitalise on those reforms undertaken by past Labor governments, to take those steps that we needed to take to ensure our prosperity. AusLink certainly comes up short and it highlights the failure of the federal government to deliver some national leadership and some genuine policy. </para><para>Adding some more weight to what I have been saying about the economic growth that we have enjoyed and the concerns that are being felt now was the release late last week of the OECD economic survey of Australia, confirming that the government has been complacent about our economic future. The OECD's report card on Australia shows that economic reform under the Howard government has stalled—there has not actually been any. The government has gone to sleep at the wheel. The report highlights the failure of the government to invest in our nation's road and rail infrastructure, hence the need for this AusLink program to put some money back. As the Deputy Prime Minister will tell you, it is a bit over $11 billion. It is $11 billion not enough and it is $11 billion too late. We need more investment and we need that investment to happen quickly. Also just a few days ago the Reserve Bank of Australia highlighted the skill shortages and infrastructure bottlenecks that are hindering the future economic growth of our nation. These problems are again a direct result of the federal government's complacency and failure to plan for the future, to do something with those good economic times that the government is so proud of.</para><para>Unlike the government, Labor refuse to take our future economic prosperity for granted, and that is why we are proposing a number of amendments to this legislation which I highlighted at the outset of my speech. Many of you in this place will have heard me talk about the Ipswich Motorway, because it is a piece of road vital to Queensland's economic future and particularly important to the south-east of Queensland. It happens to go through the middle of my electorate as well. I will say something about that. Just because a road goes through somebody's electorate, it does not necessarily mean that it belongs to that electorate. It just happens to be geographically positioned there. It belongs to all of the people of south-east Queensland. It is important for the economies of Brisbane, Ipswich and Toowoomba, to further up north and west, towards Warwick and so on. That road is the vital link, the only link. It is the lifeline between a whole range of not only cities but major regional centres as well. So my concern and my desire to see this road fully upgraded is not just about my own backyard, though I certainly want to see some improvements there as well. It is about ensuring that the south-east of Queensland, the highest growth region in Australia, is catered for and looked after by the federal government. We all know about the serious neglect.</para><para>I want to put on the record quickly some issues which highlight the overall problem with road funding as well as some details about the Ipswich Motorway and the potential for a so-called northern bypass, which is a half bypass that would skirt around the Ipswich Motorway. Since it came to power in 1996, the government has completely turned its back and walked away from a whole range of federally funded national roads and highways. It has walked away from the people in those areas, not just in my electorate but in all manner of electorates.</para><para>And with each year that has passed the task has become more difficult. With each year the planning needed—and the sort of money you need to throw at it—for these projects has become a more complex task. So much so that after $6 million was spent to do an Ipswich Motorway upgrade report the government just said that it was too difficult. It has put this bitumen basket case in the too-hard basket and has said it cannot afford to do it and that it is just too complex and difficult. So it came up with the other strategy to have a look at—and that is all it is—a possible alternative. Of course, if that falls over and is not feasible, it is back to the drawing board. </para><para>All the while this has been going on nothing has happened. This is the whole point: the benefits of the 14 years of continued economic growth, year on year, are being squandered by the government. It keeps talking about investment, our prosperity and the huge tax revenues of these great economic times, but it is not using them in a way that is nation building. It is not using them to provide the basic infrastructure that the government should be responsible for.</para><para>Regardless of the outcome of the Goodna bypass study that will be delivered at the end of this month, in my view the federal government cannot walk away from its responsibilities to federally funded roads. It must deal with those roads, regardless of what the study says. I put on the record now that, whether or not this study says it is feasible to and that it should build a northern bypass, the federal government should put some money where its mouth is. If the report says, yes, there should be a northern bypass, fine; let it be so. I am not particularly a fan of it. I am not against it, but I think the money could be better spent elsewhere. If the government is determined to spend its money on alternative roads then it should do so. Do not just give us reports; go and spend the money, get the works happening and make it happen.</para><para>At the same time, the government cannot walk away from the responsibilities it has with respect to the Ipswich Motorway. We are yet to see the outcome of that and what the government will do. Let me make a prediction, though: no matter what the report says, there will be very little money spent. That has been my experience for the last nine years: the government talks about roads but does not spend any money on them. So we still have situations like this up and down the whole country.</para><para>A few weeks ago, the Deputy Prime Minister went to the Liberal electorate of Longman to open a new road that was federally funded. He talked about how much the people of Longman deserved to have that road. I agree with him. The people in the Liberal electorate of Longman deserved to have the upgrade and a couple of hundred million dollars spent in the area, but so do the people of Ipswich and so do the people of Brisbane. They deserve to have the federal government spend some money on their roads as well.</para><para>I am very happy today to announce that the federal Labor Party through Kim Beazley has again committed to the full upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway. It is back on the national agenda; it will not go away. It is a disastrous road. There are estimations now that for every vehicle on that road there is an extra cost to its owners of something like $2,670 because of delays, extra fuel, wear on brakes and tyres and so forth. At current figures that cost will grow to nearly $5,000 by 2015 if something is not done. What concerns me is that this government has left it so late in the piece to do something. Given the best possible time frames to construct a road and the difficulties that are associated with road building, it is going to be many, many years before we see it delivered—2015 may be an optimistic view. I will be holding the government to its word with respect to the outcome of the report that is due by the end of the month.</para><para>I also want to highlight some views about road spending and infrastructure. They are not just my views or the Labor Party's views but those of the RACQ in their annual red spots survey, which identifies trouble spots on Queensland roads. Also the road solution report, commissioned by the <inline font-style="italic">Courier Mail</inline> last year, found that commuters on the Ipswich Motorway had a 50-50 chance—a one in two chance—of striking an accident or experiencing serious delays on any particular day of the week. That is certainly a poor outcome for the people of south-east Queensland. </para><para>I want to comment also on the notion of road funding and the great nation-building scheme that the government trumpets. What I cannot understand is something very simple and I would like to see the government explain it: if this national land transport plan is so important for Australia's future, why is it conditional on the states agreeing to industrial relations reform? I know a number of states have agreed to these conditions, and that is probably very smart of them. They want the money to get on with the job. They are more concerned about delivering some infrastructure to the people in their states than about squabbling over the finer points that the federal government wants.</para><para>My real concern is that, if the federal government were truly committed to delivering something for the people of Australia through a great nation-building scheme like the Snowy Mountains scheme, why has it made the funding conditional? Why will the government hold back funding indefinitely until it gets its whims on a number of issues dealt with? To me this does not sound like a government that is committed to nation-building. If you want to talk about great schemes like the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme, it would have been a disgrace had the government of the day made that conditional, as it is a disgrace today to have the funding in a document like AusLink made conditional upon a government's personal ideology. Instead of delivering infrastructure, getting on with the job and putting some time frames in place, we are seeing something very far from that.</para><para>One of things that concerned me during the election campaign was the curious sums in the funding discussed by government members and ministers when they went from electorate to electorate. There is no question about the amount of money contained in AusLink because it is all in the budget papers and there for everyone to see. Some $627 million will be committed over the next five years to five projects with the Brisbane urban connectors and the corridor. But by the government's own calculations, for the life of that document, conservatively, they are short $2.5 billion. So they have put $627 million forward, but they have come up short by at least $2.5 billion. It is pretty easy looking at the projects, doing the sums and dividing the money over five years, that they cannot deliver all of them. That is the simple mathematics of this.</para><para>Curiously, what government members and the minister did, very deceptively I have to say, was to travel from electorate to electorate and reannounce that same bucket of money—$627 million for the entire five years for all of the projects. They said: `We have actually got the money on the table. The state just has to take the money. The state needs to grab the bucket, take the money and deliver the projects.' But they cannot do that with the same bucket of money for all five projects.</para><para>I know it may be a bit complicated for government members to understand this, but it is simple mathematics. You do not have enough money and it is not funded—not only over the next five years but also in the forward estimates. By my calculations of the forward estimates through to 2009, there is no funding either now or in those budgets. It means that either one out of the five projects will be delivered in its entirety or a range of projects will be fiddled with. This is a case of the government fiddling while Rome is burning.</para><para>It will be many years down the track before we (a) see the money and (b) actually get the roads that are promised to us in this AusLink program. The Brisbane urban corridor connectors of the five projects are particularly important. They are the duplication of the Gateway Bridge, the Brisbane urban corridor through Mount Gravatt, the Ipswich motorway upgrade, the Ipswich motorway-Logan motorway interchange, and traffic management programs through the Brisbane urban corridor. But, as I said, this view that the money is on the table is far from correct, because you cannot spend the same money in five different places. It is as simple as that. </para><para>It will be no surprise to people that within the AusLink document a little bit of trickery takes place in terms of funding. The government talks about a future commitment and maintenance of funding, but it does not tell you that it has actually capped the funding. In the forward estimates and future budgets, the dollars will continue to decline in real terms in relation to the CPI. Again, this is the federal government walking away from its responsibility to the nation for roads and infrastructure.</para><para>We in the Labor Party do not just talk about this. We actually want to see some change. We want to see some money spent. We want to see a commitment to a range of projects around the country. Just prior to the last election, as part of our commitment to this nation, we put forward a number of policies, including $700 million for the full upgrade of the Ipswich motorway, $25 million for the construction of a grade separated rail overpass at Acacia Ridge, a commitment to upgrade the inner sections at Kessels and Main roads, and a range of other projects in Queensland. We also made commitments in a number of other states. We believe that it was in the best interests of all people living in those electorates, regardless of whether they were Labor or Liberal, because the flow-on effects would benefit everybody, not just a few people.</para><para>There have been a number of years of neglect and there is certainly no money in budgets to reflect the nation's need for some serious infrastructure: some roads, some rails and some cycling paths—things that are important to a range of communities. Instead, what we have seen is a classic case of pork-barrelling from The Nationals, something that they are proud of and something they even talk about. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>66</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It gives me great pleasure to rise in the House in this debate on the <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2237">AusLink (National Land Transport—Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004</inline>. Reading the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and listening to government members opposite, one would be forgiven for believing that the national land transport plan was the grand product of the visionary minds of the Liberal-National parties. Historically, that is not the case. The Hawke-Keating Labor government actively implemented a strategic and integrated land transport plan when it was in office. That was part of a massive economic contribution that Labor in government made to the current economic prosperity that Australians enjoy. Indeed, it was Labor in government that set the growth benchmark of four per cent per annum for the four years before it left office. If you listen to honourable members opposite—the Treasurer and the Prime Minister—you would think that four per cent growth was something new. Sorry, but Labor left the Liberal Party and the National Party a growth rate in Australia of four per cent in the four years before it left office.</para></talk.start><para>It was Labor in government that broke the back of double digit Liberal inflation—reducing it to under two per cent and laying the basis for the low interest rate regime that we currently enjoy. It was Labor that brought unemployment below the historical 10 per cent levels that prevailed when John Howard had stewardship of the treasury bench, it was Labor that transformed this country's industrial structure to the innovative and productive economy that we see today and it was Labor in office that provided a proper infrastructure planning framework for road, rail, sea and air transport in this country. </para><para>My involvement in land transport issues and my pursuit of a strategic and integrated approach to funding of essential infrastructure in this area goes back to before I entered this parliament in 1993. I was a member of a Geelong community lobby group in the early 1990s that successfully lobbied the then Labor government to route the national standard gauge through Geelong, in my electorate. I have successfully lobbied state and federal governments for funding to integrate road and rail modes and provide links to the port of Geelong. I have actively promoted Avalon airport as a transport hub and an airfreight and passenger centre, with plans to integrate the significant transport assets of the Geelong region, namely Avalon airport, the port of Geelong, the national standard gauge line, the Princes Highway and the major state road networks. Since I was elected in 1993 to the seat of Corio, I have also been an active part of a successful lobbying effort to construct a third lane on the Princes Highway between Geelong and Melbourne. I modestly say I played a not too insignificant role in lobbying within my party's ranks for the Geelong bypass funding. This secured a bipartisan commitment at the federal level to funding this strategic piece of infrastructure in the Geelong region.</para><para>I mention these involvements because this is an area close to my heart. It is important to my electorate of Corio and the Geelong community and it is central to my shadow ministerial portfolio responsibilities in agriculture and fisheries. That is why I was absolutely dismayed today when I read the headline in the <inline font-style="italic">Geelong Advertiser</inline> `Ring road funds spat'. The article reported that the AusLink funding for key Victorian road projects, including the Geelong ring road, was not going anywhere unless Melbourne's Scoresby bypass became a freeway. That was the attitude of the federal government. I quote from that article:</para><quote><para>A spokesman for Federal Transport Minister John Anderson returned fire—</para></quote><para>because of this spat—</para><quote><para>and said the State Government had known since May 2004 that Scoresby would have to be a freeway to free up AusLink money.</para><para>“They're lying through their teeth, I'm sorry but there's no other word for it,” Mr Anderson's spokesman Paul Chamberlin said.</para></quote><para>Here we have the minister's spokesperson in the <inline font-style="italic">Geelong Advertiser </inline>today linking the provision of AusLink funding to the Scoresby project in Melbourne.

In fact, over the last year consumer sentiment has risen 3½ per cent to be 22 per cent above the long-term average, which is quite extraordinary.</para></talk.start><para>Why are Australian consumers recording such high levels of sentiment at the moment? Labour market conditions are the best they have been for 30 years, with unemployment down to 5.1 per cent. Household disposable income has been growing around nine per cent per annum, driven by strong employment and solid real wages growth. I do want to make this point: it is the government's view that we would like to see real wage increases, unlike Labor, which championed the cause of real wage decline during the 1980s, but we know that real wage increases can only be based on productivity. In addition, household wealth has grown quite significantly over the last two years.</para><para>As people start filing their tax returns, those eligible families that are on family tax benefit part A will also be receiving, again, a $600 lump sum, notwithstanding the fact that Labor's new so-called economic spokesman maintains the money does not exist. I was doing a radio interview last week and the commentator pointed out to me that, with four children, he got $2,400 last year. I asked him what he did with it. He said he bought a greyhound and he called it `Lump Sum'. The money was not provided so that you could buy greyhounds but it was the first time I ever heard you could buy a greyhound without real money—a lot of people have lost real money on greyhounds. Families will be eligible for a second payment once they lodge their income tax return. That is real money which parents throughout Australia are able to spend on things that they need for their children and that they need to look after their families. As I said, this government believes that it is important that we continue to drive economic reform, that we continue to keep unemployment low and that we continue to keep productivity strong. That is what economic reform is all about. </para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>71</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>71</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Order!

I have to say he is not the only one. We have quite a group of people who have been very keen to see Scoresby get up and to see the national highway through the north of Victoria upgraded. Indeed, under our transport plan for the nation, AusLink, we are proposing something in the order of a 120 per cent increase in funding for Victoria alone over the next five years compared to the last five years, reflecting the very real infrastructure needs up and down the east coast and in Victoria in particular.</para></talk.start><para>Australia does need better road and rail infrastructure, but we need to ensure that we get value for money. I recorded here yesterday that I was delighted that South Australia has signed up to our construction code, and I am delighted to see too that Victoria has agreed to important industrial relations reforms, by agreeing to our industrial relations construction code objectives. That code will deliver high-quality, efficient and economical construction of major road and rail projects. It will drive taxpayers' dollars further—and that is very important.</para><para>In relation to Victoria, all we need to get the ball rolling is for Victoria to sign off on the bilateral which we have been negotiating for a long time.

I want to stress that, whilst it is our position that where there was a written promise it ought to be honoured, we will not hold up AusLink in Victoria on this matter. We simply make the point: sign the bilateral and get the projects going. If you will not build a freeway for the people in that part of Melbourne, that is okay. We will not put any money towards it, but that is no reason to hold the rest of it up. We want to get those projects going. They are important for exports, they are important for jobs, they are important for amenity and they are important environmentally.

The member for Grey represents an electorate that covers a large part of South Australia, an electorate that makes a significant contribution to the economic wellbeing of Australia. The simple answer is that our export performance last year—in the calendar year 2004—was very good. Our exports rose, both in value terms and in volume terms. For the information of the House, in 2004 our exports rose by $11.7 billion, to finish the year at $152½ billion worth of goods and services exported out of Australia, earning much needed dollars for our economy.</para></talk.start><para>The growth was recorded in all sectors. Rural exports grew by 20 per cent—that is an important element of the member for Grey's constituency; resources exports increased by 13 per cent; services exports grew by 5 per cent; and manufacturing exports grew by 2 per cent. The House should recognise that, when analysing trade performance, you need to factor both merchandise and services into the equation. In volume terms exports rose by 7 per cent over the first three-quarters of last year—the figures are only available up until September. So in volume terms and value terms both merchandise and services achieved significant increases through the calendar year last year.</para><para>Our export performance would be even better if our exporters did not have to deal with some industrial action taken by some of the trade unions in Australia like the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union. It is interesting to note that in January both Toyota and Holden were forced to import automotive quality steel into Australia to keep their production lines going, because of industrial action being taken by the CEPU at BlueScope Steel. Can you believe it? Holden and Toyota were flying steel into Australia in Antonov aircraft. Our nation is the largest producer of iron ore in the world, and we are buying steel offshore to keep our manufacturing industries going. Kirby Adams, the Managing Director of BlueScope Steel, had something very instructive to say about this:</para><quote><para>It is an unfortunate truth, and not widely stated, that the irresponsible actions of a few union leaders and officials are creating real hesitation about new and large scale manufacturing investment in this country.</para></quote><para>That is not the government saying that; that is the managing director of Bluescope Steel. The Australian Labor Party should be cognisant of what industry is saying in this regard.</para><para>One of the reasons our government wants to reform the Australian workplace is so that our exporters of manufactured goods are not held to ransom by militant union leaders. If the opposition wants to make a contribution to this debate they should support the government's reforms in the Australian workplace to ensure that our exporters do not have to be confronted by this. But we do know that that is probably unlikely, given that since 1995 the Australian Labor Party has received something like $3.3 million in donations from the CEPU. So, if the Labor Party want to help the manufacturing industries and help Australia's export effort, they can get the unions off the back of the manufacturers. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Regional Services: Program Funding</title><page.no>75</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>75</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name><name.id>UK6</name.id><electorate>Wills</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is again to the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads.

This government believes that the No. 1 priority in school education in Australia is to raise the respect society has for teaching as a profession and also to ensure that the teaching profession is supported in setting and maintaining its own performance standards for both school leaders and teachers. To that end, the government has committed $10 million initially to the establishment of the National Institute for Quality Teaching and School Leadership at ANU, to both set and define nationally consistent standards for teacher education throughout Australia. In addition to that, there is a range of other initiatives, including the direct support of ongoing teacher training and $109 million, for example, for improving teacher undergraduate education and the higher education reforms.</para></talk.start><para>It was with a great sense of dismay and concern that I read the editorial of the Australian Association for the Teaching of English professional journal, which was published today in part on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>.

Unlike Labor, the Howard government recognises that an increasing number of older Australians wish to remain at home as they age, and their families are looking for more options and more choices for their older Australians. That is why the government has increased the number of community aged care packages—that is, low-level care delivered at home—from some 4,400 packages when we first came to office to over 31,000 packages that are available for community care today. That is an increase of about 700 per cent, yet the age group over 70 has increased by only perhaps 20 per cent during that time. We have also introduced the innovative extended aged care at home packages, which are an extension of community care, to cover situations where people require high-level nursing home care but delivered at home. We will deliver on our election commitment to provide a further 2,000 extended aged care at home packages which are dementia specific—targeted for people who have specific needs because they are suffering from dementia.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to community care packages, in January I was delighted to announce that a further 2,818 community aged care and extended aged care at home packages were subsidised by the Australian government and allocated across Australia.

This is a program riddled with rorts, one after another. That will become obvious as the days of this parliament proceed. This is kleptomania dressed up in the guise of public policy on infrastructure. In this particular case, it was the barrel before the pork, because the announcement was made before any conceivable consideration of it was given by any authority. But the conclusion, the denouement, was—and I was interested because there was one piece of information that we did not have and that was revealed by the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads in his remarks here—that in December there was a statement by the city engineer in regard to the opening of the creek which followed the various instructions by the minister's office to the council to change its mind and change its view. Some poor devil of a public servant in the Wyong Shire Council was dragged kicking and screaming into the conspiracy after he—no doubt the same official—had advised the councillors earlier on that they should seek to redeploy those funds because they were needed elsewhere and not at the mouth of Tumbi Creek.</para><para>Don't go on with this rubbish about the Labor Party supporting this. We supported this when the mouth of the creek was closed. What we are talking about is a situation where the mouth of the creek was open and what was required when the mouth of the creek was open.</para><para>Two documents suffice to demonstrate the culpability in regard to this fraud. One is from Graeme Hallett, special adviser to the Hon. Jim Lloyd, corresponding with his department. This is the document that launched the conspiracy, if you like, because it is a document that flowed from knowledge coming into the minister's office, no doubt from Mr Ticehurst and others, that the council was changing its mind and wanted the money for something else—that the department was indeed recommending that something else ought to happen and that the particular grant ought not to be proceeded with. What did Mr Hallett say to Giulio, who is obviously the chap in the department who receives these things? He says: </para><quote><para>In the light of this development ...</para></quote><para>That development is the councillor's motion that `some recent heavy rainfall has to some extent ameliorated the environmental problem identified at Tumbi Creek' and that one councillor Graeme had `mooted the view that the funds could be re-allocated for other upstream bank erosion works'.

Given the minister's closeness to Mr Ticehurst, the member for Dobell, and given his proximity to his own seat in the area, the notion that he himself would not be aware of what was going on in his office is absolute nonsense, and it is an excuse we will not accept.</para><para>This is the particular missive directed to Ken Ticehurst, Mayor Brenton Pavier, Councillor Greg Best, Councillor Ron Stevens, Councillor Doug Eaton and Councillor Robin Stewart:</para><quote><para>Subject: FW: Tumbi Creek project funding agreement with the Commonwealth</para><para>See the response below.</para><para>Any change means less federal money, so the Wyong officials should keep their counsel on this if we want the total allocated by the PM for Tumbi Creek.</para><para>regards</para><para>Graeme</para></quote><para>`Regards, Graeme' indeed! Understand the import of this. This is $1.5 million worth of Commonwealth dough. It is $1.5 million and not $750,000 because, no matter what was said by the government of the day—or the opposition for that matter in the course of the last election campaign—the NSW government says: `You have got to be joking. We are not going to join in this pork-barrel parade, thank you very much. We are out of this.' So what happened? The Prime Minister turned up and he said in the election campaign: `Not only have you got the $750,000 that came through, in the first instance, from the promise of the member and was subsequently endorsed by the council, but you have got $750,000 on top of it because I, John Howard, am stepping in where Bob Carr neglectfully fears to tread. I am going to make the dough available to you all. I am going to make the $1.5 million available to you all, as it turned out, whether you need it or not. We are going to rack out that $1.5 million for you and the minister's office is going to discipline any councillor or council engineer who dares reveal the fact that the mouth of the river is open, the boats are all going out and the $1.5 million might be usefully spent in smaller amounts elsewhere. </para><para>That is the nub of this particular matter, but it is surrounded by the whole panoply of malpractice and impropriety that has gone into this roads project. There has been no study of any of the propositions—in this case it is announced before it is asked for. The relevant authority, being the Wyong Shire Council, who has responsibility for public works in relation to local government expenditures in the particular area, has not even thought of the darn thing. But the member for Dobell and the minister are out there making this case and the now Minister for Veterans' Affairs is out there making the announcement. Desperately struggling to catch up is the council, 16 days later, saying: `Oh, yes, we will have it. Yes, we will have the money for this please. Yes, we will have it.' And that well-known process in Minister Anderson's department of detailed consideration by departmental officials, of rigid cost-benefit analyses, of determination of what the national interest is, of fundamental research into the economic needs of the people of this area all took precisely six hours before the grant was finally ticked off—immediately approved within 24 hours of the council putting in the request for it.</para><para>The simple fact of the matter is that every element of this program is a disgrace—every single element of it. You know darn well that this is a multimillion dollar slush fund—tens of millions of dollars which should be spent properly on decent infrastructure projects is going down the gurgler to save a dozen National Party members and half a dozen Liberals on top of that. This government, in its dotage, has lost its grip on what are public funds and what are theirs. It has finally got to the position where it is prepared to defraud the Commonwealth and instruct people they are to have the money whether they want it or not, simply to preserve the credibility of its members. One and a half million dollars worth of taxpayers' funds have been defrauded under the explicit instructions of the minister's office, over the objection of the minister's department and over the objection, when they were looking at it in clear-eyed fashion, of the local council.

Following the rain, the Tuggerah Lakes Estuary and Coastal Management Committee, comprising Wyong Shire Council, New South Wales government and community representatives, heard that Tumbi Creek was open and sought the reallocation of funding for the dredging works. A motion was put to the next Wyong Shire Council meeting in similar terms.

The opposition has obtained emails from Graeme Hallet, the special adviser to Minister Lloyd, demonstrating a very close involvement in the progress of the project in late 2004.

It gets even worse. In an email obtained by the opposition, the department told Mr Hallett that it was waiting for advice from Wyong Shire Council about the state of the creek mouth and, subject to that advice, contemplating a reduced Commonwealth contribution. Mr Hallett forwarded a copy of the department's advice, which was presumably intended solely for him in his capacity as special adviser, to the member for Dobell and the Wyong Shire Council's non-Labor councillors, including the Liberal mayor, and issued the following warning:</para><quote><para>Any changes means less federal money, so the Wyong officials should keep their counsel on this if we want the total allocated by the PM for Tumbi Creek.</para></quote><para>The Wyong mayor sent a note to two other councillors seeking to have that notice of motion changed, with the message: `no doubt you would be aware of the letter from DOTARS that has been emailed to us.' This special adviser to Minister Lloyd was telling the Wyong Shire Council to keep their traps shut. You may remember that John Cleese's character Basil Fawlty became famous for saying, `Don't mention the war.' Mr Hallett was saying, `Don't mention the rain.' The message for Wyong council was: `Don't come back to us saying we don't need to flush the creek anymore, because you'll lose the money if you do.'</para><para>This amounts to a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth to hand over taxpayers' money under false pretences. The minister should be censured and the people of Australia need to be provided with a full account of the roles that this minister and the member for Dobell have played in this conspiracy. It is bad enough and farcical enough that Minister Kelly was prepared to approve these grants and announce these allocations even before an application had been made to her. Even worse is that this minister and the member for Dobell want that money to be paid, even though the rain has ensured that the project is no longer needed.

Let us not underestimate the seriousness of the charge that members opposite are making. They are making the very serious charge that a minister in this government, his office and another member of this government have attempted, in effect, to defraud the Commonwealth. It is a very serious charge, and it should not be made without very strong evidence. I have listened to the extracts that have been read to the House by the Leader of the Opposition and by the member for Wills. All I can hear in the extracts from those emails is evidence that this is a government that does not renege on its commitments. That is the evidence that I have heard given to this House. I have not heard any evidence of any attempt to defraud the Commonwealth or of any conspiracy to do anything other than deliver on a commitment that this government made—a commitment which, I remind members opposite, was supported by them. </para></talk.start><para>Challenged by members opposite, the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads did absolutely the right thing. He said he would check the record with his department and with his office. That is precisely what a minister of the Crown should do when confronted with the kind of questioning that members opposite have subjected him to today. Members opposite could have waited for this minister, this good and decent man, to come back having checked the record. But no, they are not prepared to do that at all. They have jumped the gun. They have leapt into typical opposition tactics of smearing without substance, of rushing in with the most serious allegations, which certainly are not proven on the basis of the emails that have been selectively read to this House by the Leader of the Opposition.</para><para>Let us examine again exactly what the Leader of the Opposition is putting to this House. He is putting to this House not just that the minister, the minister's office or the member for Dobell have done the wrong thing but that Wyong council—not just councillors but the professional staff of Wyong council—have engaged in a grand conspiracy to try to defraud the Commonwealth of money that Wyong council did not need.</para><para>I remind members opposite of the material that the minister presented today to the House from the Wyong shire engineer, from December, which said that this dredging was still required. For the charge of the members opposite to be sustained, that professional officer of Wyong council would have to have been engaging in a conspiracy of deception and a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. It is a very serious charge to make against a professional. Let us rue the day that the Leader of the Opposition can come into this House and make that kind of allegation without substantial evidence to back it up, because it is a very serious smear not just against politicians or members of the government but against a professional officer of a New South Wales council. I hope he has the evidence. On the basis of what he has said today in this House, he does not have the evidence.</para><para>Let me remind members opposite that this grant that they are now so opposed to was something that they entirely supported during the election campaign. Let me remind members opposite that they supported during the election campaign a series of grants that they now claim to be corrupt pork-barrelling. There is not a single grant made under the Regional Partnerships program that members opposite criticised at the time those grants were announced. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition: if he is serious about his current contempt for the Regional Partnerships program, can he give us one example, just one, of a Regional Partnerships grant announced during the election that he and his team opposed? He will not be able to do it, because these were all perfectly reasonable grants made on a perfectly reasonable basis.</para><para>Members opposite are waxing indignant about grants made by this government under the Regional Partnerships program. Let me remind the House of some of the grants that would have been made by the opposition had they won the election. These are some of the grants that were promised by members of the opposition. I challenge members of the opposition to produce any scientific study, any serious cost-benefit analysis or any profound detailed examination of the promises that they made during the election campaign. Let me name just a few of them. There was $1 million for a national centre of democracy at the Eureka Centre in Ballarat. Where was the cost-benefit analysis for that? What rigorous examination did this grant announcement go through? There was $10 million for a national museum of Indigenous culture in Cairns. Again, where was the rigorous analysis? To what scrutiny was this promise subjected? Listen to this one. This was announced by the then Leader of the Opposition on 9 September: $1 million to whichever entity took over the vacant Austoft site in Bundaberg. They did not care who got the money; they just wanted to give the money to someone. There was $1.5 million to a turtle interpretation centre, $3 million for sporting complexes at Thuringowa and $6 million to upgrade the Rockhampton Showgrounds. </para><para>For all I know, they might be quite worthy projects. But the fact is that they were made by the opposition without any serious examination, and the opposition has the cheek and the hide to come into this chamber and condemn this government up hill and down dale for making grants under a perfectly regular federal government program which has gone through the usual kind of scrutiny that federal government program grants have applied to them.</para><para>The Regional Partnerships program has been perfectly, competently and properly administered by the Public Service of this country and by the government of Australia. Allegations of political bias simply do not hold up to scrutiny. The reason why—and it is quite simple—the majority of funds went to coalition electorates is because we have the majority of electorates. If members opposite won more seats, they could expect to get more money under programs such as Regional Partnerships. The fact is that, of the applications for Regional Partnerships funding, 78 per cent of those applications in Labor and Independent electorates were approved. Members on this side of the House have some reason to be disappointed—only 77 per cent of applications in coalition electorates were approved.</para><para>This is a good government administering a reasonable and necessary program to put the heart and soul back into country Australia. By contrast, it is the same tired old opposition, the same stale faces, spouting the same old message that we got before Christmas time. Latham has gone, but Labor has not changed. Not only that, the member for Brand has not changed—it is still the same old histrionic style that the Australian people have heard so often before and rejected so often before.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Mr Beazley's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>15:16:00</time.stamp><para>The House divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Speaker—Mr David Hawker)

The member for Hunter suggested that comments made by the Deputy Speaker constituted an intervention in debate on the motion of dissent.</para></talk.start><para>I have consulted the relevant <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and commissioned research into similar situations. <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice</inline> indicates, at page 565, that words critical of the character or conduct of a person—and this includes members of the House—whose actions can only be challenged by means of a substantive motion should not be included in the terms of a matter of public importance. The serious nature of such challenges is emphasised by the fact that a substantive motion allows the House to vote on such actions. A matter of public importance does not provide opportunity for the House to come to a decision by a vote.</para><para>The terms of the matter approved for discussion on 8 December did not specifically identify any persons. However, when matters of this kind are being discussed by the House, it is not in order to make comments that are critical, in a personal sense, of individuals during the course of the discussion. Matters such as that proposed for discussion on 8 December tend to provide challenges for self-discipline by members of the House. When this self-discipline is absent, it is incumbent upon the occupant of the chair to intervene. This has been the situation for some time, as indicated by the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 9 April 1974 in respect of Deputy Speaker Scholes, and of 28 November 1995 in respect of Deputy Speaker Jenkins.</para><para>On 8 November, on more than one occasion the Deputy Speaker requested the member addressing the House to desist from the terms he was using in speaking to the matter of public importance. The Deputy Speaker then ordered the member to resume his seat when he persisted. I believe that there were a number of options available to the Deputy Speaker in a situation that could have been construed as defiance of the chair, including naming and subsequent suspension of the member, and ordering the member to withdraw from the chamber for an hour. In withdrawing the member's call to talk on the matter, the Deputy Speaker could be seen to have applied a less harsh option.</para><para>In relation to the specific question put to me by the member for Hunter, I believe that, on a rigid application of the standing orders and <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice</inline>, the Deputy Speaker was not required to accept the motion of dissent stemming from his requirement for the member for Wills to resume his seat. Following the moving of the motion of dissent by the then Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Speaker, in making the statement which forms the substance of the member for Hunter's complaint, was simply placing before the House a summary of the statement on the practice of the House that he had made during the comments made by the member for Wills—namely, that it was not in order, in addressing a matter of public importance, to make personal reflections on and imputations against a member of the House in the absence of a substantive motion. The Deputy Speaker thus provided the House with a succinct statement of the proposition on which it was going to be asked to vote on the motion of dissent. This was an appropriate course of action, in my opinion. </para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>88</page.no></debateinfo><para>Mr ABBOTT (Warringah—Leader of the House) (3.32 p.m.)—Documents are presented as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members.

Let me say in response that essentially we were had and the Australian people were had. We were given the impression that there was an orderly, independent process of assessment of these applications and that these grants were being made pursuant to that due process. Subsequently, the truth has come out that applications were approved without an application even being lodged. Applications were approved without the support or recommendation of the local area consultative committee. Applications were approved for projects which were in competition with other, private sector projects—the doctrine of competitive neutrality was being flouted. Applications were approved in circumstances where there was such a flagrant conflict of interest that a representative of the applicants was working as a staffer in the minister's officer. So, all over the place, we have come across unsatisfactory, inappropriate, improper aspects of administration of this program, and we intend to criticise them. It would be irresponsible of us to do anything less than that.</para></talk.start><para>The other thing that the minister said by way of response to some of our concerns about Regional Partnerships was the claim that a similar number of applications from Labor electorates were successful compared to the number coming from Liberal and National Party electorates. Let me assure the House that the only reason there is any substance to that is that there is a very low number of applications coming forward from Labor electorates compared with those coming from Liberal and National Party electorates. The reason for that is that Regional Partnerships has essentially been operated as a secret society. I invite members on my side of the House to indicate to me just what advice they received from the government about the existence of this scheme. It was a scheme whereby the government appointed the chairs of the area consultative committees—they appointed their fellow committee members—and then set about assessing applications. Many of those applications have been essentially inside jobs. This is a program for those in the know. We have seen it degenerate into a $150 million pork barrel administered by the Leader of the National Party himself. </para><para>We are indebted to the Independent member for New England for first blowing the whistle in relation to this arrangement. He had the temerity to think that there might be some Regional Partnerships money for projects in his electorate—for example, the Tamworth Equine and Livestock Centre—and the message came back from the government: `No, we're not going to fund that project while the Independent member for New England is associated with it.' Their idea was that the purpose of this program was to benefit the National Party. So, if the Independent member for New England was associated with it, it certainly was not achieving its purpose at all. So they had to get rid of him. When we asked Minister Anderson about this, he said that the reason that they had demanded that the name of the Independent member for New England be removed from the application was that they did not want the program to be political.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition member interjecting—</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name></talker><para>—Yes, astonishing—a great sense of irony! When we started examining this program we found, as I have indicated to the House, applications being approved prior to applications being lodged, applications falling over and applications being approved despite the advice of the department. The Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee discovered in its hearings last week that principally Minister Kelly had departed from departmental recommendations not to approve a project and had decided to approve projects on 11 occasions. On a further three occasions she had given the projects 100 per cent of the funding sought, when the department had recommended less. On a further three occasions, where the department had recommended that a project be approved, she had not approved the project. The Auditor-General has made plain in his investigation of previous programs that he believes that where this happens there needs to be a paper trail, that the reasons for the departure from the departmental recommendation need to be given and that those reasons need to be made public.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is extraordinary that this government refuses to make public the reasons for those decisions and departures. Indeed, this government refuses to make public the recommendations from the area consultative committees. That makes a joke of the whole process of independent assessment. It makes a farce of the whole idea of public accountability—where the government goes before the Senate committee and says, `No, we are not prepared to tell you what the area consultative committee has recommended,' and, when it suits the government, it will say, `Oh, this project was recommended by the area consultative committee.' But it is not prepared to make available to the House and to the people of Australia the totality of recommendations coming forward from area consultative committees about these projects. </para><para>The other comment I would like to make about this idea that 78 per cent of projects have been approved is that it is almost an `everyone's a winner' situation. Some honourable members will remember the Centenary of Federation projects. All of us, as local members, had the capacity to go out and seek applications. I do not know what the general arrangement was, but in my electorate we ended up funding six or seven applications but knocking back 40 or 50, so it was not an `everyone's a winner' situation. There were many more applications than could be successful grants. But Regional Partnerships has been a program for those in the know and as a result there has been a relative scarcity of applications. It has not been advertised in the newspapers, on radio or on TV. Opposition members have not been informed of the nature of it; it has been kept in-house.</para><para>Since my speech in parliament before Christmas on this issue we have learned details of a further project where good money was thrown after bad. Some $660,000 of taxpayers' money was given to the Beaudesert Shire Railway Support Group through the Regional Partnerships program in a circumstance where Beaudesert Rail had gone into receivership back in May 2003. That did not stop this government committing a further $660,000 to get Beaudesert Rail out of receivership. But we know that this project is not happening, even though Beaudesert Rail came out of receivership late last year with creditors receiving just 19 cents in the dollar. I understand that this project ceased operating in August this year and is subject to continuing legal action by creditors. Taxpayers are entitled to much more prudent stewardship of their money than this.</para><para>Today we have seen a situation which just about takes the cake in terms of Regional Partnerships worst practice. Back in July and August 2004 the government announced two Regional Partnerships program grants totalling $1.5 million to facilitate dredging of Tumbi Creek, located at The Entrance in the marginal electorate of Dobell. Those grants, announced by the local member for Dobell and by the Prime Minister, were to fund the dredging of the mouth of Tumbi Creek and the relocation of spoil to the municipal tip. We matched the government's funding commitment during the 2004 election campaign. We were told this project had been approved under Regional Partnerships. We assumed that it had been properly assessed, so why wouldn't we support it? Like all other Australians, we have been misled in relation to this matter.</para><para>The member for Dobell announced the first Regional Partnerships grant of $748,000 on 8 June. That announcement preceded Wyong Shire Council's consideration of a dredging options report and a decision to lodge an application under the Regional Partnerships program. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> Central Coast extra edition on 9 June last year carried this report:</para><quote><para>Federal member for Dobell, Ken Ticehurst, yesterday committed the money to pay for 15,000 cubic metres of spoil to be dredged and dumped at Buttonderry Tip near Wyee under the Regional Partnerships program. Wyong Shire Council will meet tonight to decide how best to deal with the Tumbi Creek problem and whether or not to apply for the funding.</para></quote><para>What a bizarre process. How can the member for Dobell be saying that Minister Kelly has approved this project when Minister Kelly has not even seen an application? She has approved the grant; now all we need is the application. That reminds me of the Queen of Hearts in <inline font-style="italic">Alice in Wonderland</inline>, who sentenced first and the trial came later. In Minister Kelly's case, it is grant first and lodge the application later. According to advice from the Department of Transport and Regional Services to the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee regional funding inquiry, the first Tumbi Creek funding application was lodged on 24 June last year and approved on the same day—16 days after the member for Dobell announced the first Regional Partnerships funding allocation. This ought to be compared with other area consultative committees, who have been waiting months and months for a decision from this department. </para><para>We also discovered that there was a second application. The Department of Transport and Regional Services told the Senate inquiry that Regional Partnerships applications were lodged on 24 June and on 11 July. The Prime Minister announced the second Regional Partnerships funding allocation on 26 August, three days before the federal election date was named, and yet the Department of Transport and Regional Services says that just one approval was made, on 24 June—the same day the first application was received. Either no formal approval was granted with respect to the second funding application, or the full funding was approved prior to submission of the second application and the public campaign for state government funding was just a charade. It is important to understand that no part of this process fell within the election period and no action related to this process could be considered as an election commitment free from the rigour of standard administrative processes.</para><para>We have also discovered that the local area advisory consultative committee considers the project proposal a low priority and that the New South Wales government has expressed concern about the proposed expenditure of $2 million on remedial action unrelated to the Tuggerah Lakes estuary management plan. As I indicated to the House earlier, not only did we have that bizarre and farcical situation of grants being approved without applications even being made, let alone assessed, but we subsequently had a situation where rainfall last year washed out the Tumbi Creek mouth. We had a situation where Mr Graeme Hallett, a special adviser in the office of Jim Lloyd, Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, wrote to Giulio Cerasani, Mr Cobb's DLO, about the conditions for this grant, making clear his expectation that there would be no doubt about the way forward to deliver the commitment on Tumbi Creek. I understand that Mr Hallett had been working as one of the campaign team in the office of the member for Dobell, so he was in a position to know a great deal about the member for Dobell's views on these matters. He fired off an email to the department saying, `We don't want any doubt about the way forward to deliver the commitment on Tumbi Creek.' He said:</para><quote><para>The commitment by the Howard government to the electors of Dobell, in partnership with the Wyong council, is non-negotiable. It is the position of Mr Ticehurst that the money be delivered as agreed for the works in the schedule of agreement under Regional Partnerships.</para></quote><para>His message to the department was very clear. His expectation was that that money would be paid over, regardless of whether or not it was needed any longer for dredging works. When his email to the department did not seem to be hitting the mark, he fired off another email to the member for Dobell and the Wyong shire non-Labor councillors, issuing the following warning:</para><quote><para>Any changes mean less federal money, so Wyong officials should keep their counsel on this if we want the total allocated by the PM for Tumbi Creek.</para></quote><para>The import of that email is absolutely clear. The intention is to defraud taxpayers. The intention is to make sure that the grant goes ahead, whether it is needed or not. That is scandalous. We have the minister's office seeking to mislead his own department. We have the minister's office telling Wyong Shire Council, `You keep quiet about this; otherwise we will lose some of this money.' This is a disgraceful situation. It is time the Prime Minister faced up to his responsibilities under his ministerial code of conduct. It is time he faced up to his responsibility to make sure that Regional Partnerships becomes something better than a National Party slush fund. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>92</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I certainly welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance, especially when it is to make clear what an incredibly good program Regional Partnerships has been. While the input from the members opposite has been all about what it does for National Party people—they intimate that this is in regional and remote Australia—in actual fact today they have done nothing but talk about almost metropolitan projects. And that is what Regional Partnerships is about. It does not just look after regional Australia. Obviously it stresses the needs of regional Australia, but it also looks after outer metropolitan areas.</para></talk.start><para>This program was put in place some 18 months ago. It was done not because one day the government decided to see just what it might be able to do for regional Australia but because some five or six years ago the Deputy Prime Minister called a Regional Australia Summit. Quite obviously the members of the opposition do not like the fact that Regional Partnerships is an incredibly successful program. It is probably the most popular program in Australia today, perhaps second to or running in conjunction with Roads to Recovery, which is also something this government brought in. This area having been ignored by Labor for 13 years, Roads to Recovery, like Regional Partnerships, is out there expressly to help people who desperately need it.</para><para>Some five years ago the Deputy Prime Minister, who was then the minister for regional services, called a summit of some 200 or 300 people from right around Australia. As a matter of fact, I was there in the guise of an agropolitician, representing farmers from around Australia. I was one of those delegates. That conference, that gathering here in Canberra of people from right around regional Australia, looked at what was happening at a time when the efficiency driven rationalisation of farming in country Australia and unemployment were at their height and we needed to know what could be done about them. For three days those delegates were helped by people from government and from the universities of regional Australia to sort out their ideas. And they had ideas.</para><para>The government looked at the things that conference came up with that it, in partnership with the communities of regional Australia, could do to make things work, to get things going—to get the guts of regional Australia turned around and to help it go forward once again. There was a very strong call that there needed to be a mechanism that would enable our communities to build their own way ahead—a vehicle to help them help themselves and enable us to go forward and help them. It would be a leg-up, a new start, to address local needs.</para><para>What happened? The government listened to what 200 or 300 people from right around Australia said. We did not listen to bureaucrats; we did not listen to politicians; we listened to what the people out there said should happen. One of the many responses to the Regional Australia Summit was to develop a range of policies and programs, using examples of what people from Western Australia, northern Queensland, western New South Wales and places like Bendigo and Ballarat had been able to do for themselves. The particular areas that were addressed were health, education, jobs, capacity building and restructuring, where particular infrastructure had failed services or where particular industries were no longer viable in an area. </para><para>One of the key initiatives, one of the first responses, was the government's Regional Solutions Program, which enabled communities to apply for funds to work in community situations. Lo and behold, it was highly successful. It was the forerunner to Regional Partnerships. When the Regional Solutions Program reached the end of its life it became obvious that, in a partnership situation, we could help regional Australia rebuild itself—that we could make an enormous difference. Eighteen months ago Regional Partnerships was born. It brought together the government's key regional development programs, including the Regional Solutions Program, the Regional Assistance Program—RAP—the Rural Transaction Centres program and the government's specially targeted structural adjustment initiatives. The aim of it was to strengthen economic growth and help with services and regional planning—to give people an opportunity to help themselves. Major structural change was enabled by it. One of the major things to come out of Regional Partnerships is that it helps creates new jobs. People help themselves create new jobs.</para><para>I do not think it will come as a surprise, even to those opposite, to learn that this government is a huge supporter of regional development. We believe in it. We believe in supporting the regions. Agriculture, even without mining, is still responsible for creating nearly one-quarter of Australia's exports. Through Regional Partnerships and as a result of that original summit we continue to respond to what regional Australia wants—to the needs of country people in towns, in the bush and all around the country. The rationalisation that has occurred in the last 10 to 20 years has been absolutely enormous, with environmental change and major economic and social change. All we have done is respond to that, and we have responded very well.</para><para>I guess it is hard for those opposite, because they never tried to do anything about it. They never made any attempt to find out what the problems were in the first place and they certainly did not attempt to address them. What makes Regional Partnerships so successful? It is not just us on our own or the communities on their own. It is the local communities, the local government, the local councils, the Commonwealth and your friends the state government who are supporting Regional Partnerships. Every $1 that we put into a Regional Partnerships program is on average attracting $3 more. Some of that, I grant you, is state money. Your political colleagues, if I may call them that, around the country obviously see what a beneficial tool Regional Partnerships is, how necessary it is and what a heck of a good job it is doing. We are not only helping to create jobs, we are stimulating local economies. More than anything, what we are doing is working. I think that is what is upsetting you: it works, we invented it, we made sure that we listened to the communities and we pushed it forward. Even your own political colleagues are working with us to help make it work.</para><para>While those on the other side do not like it, the main reason that I think we are standing here today talking about this is that they would like very much to divert the government, the parliament and certainly Australia from their own problems. What better thing to do than try to attack one of the most successful programs any government has ever devised? So they start a Senate inquiry, which is quite obviously nothing more than a witch-hunt. It has tried to discredit the integrity of this program, which I have demonstrated is one of the more successful programs that has ever been created. </para><para>I heard the member for Wills not long ago talking about the fact that 78 per cent of these projects go through. So he is assuming that not enough are being applied for. What he totally misunderstands—he understands nothing about the whole program—is that the ACCs try to help people in their attempts to make applications. The department helps people in their attempts to make applications. Those that are wildly unlikely to get up never see the light of day, because it is pointed out that they are not appropriate. Seventy-eight per cent is a very creditable figure when you realise that a lot of people are being steered the right way from the start: 1,111 projects, roughly $202 million worth, have been submitted; 674, $150 million worth, have been assessed; 522, $125 million worth, have been approved; 152 have not been approved; and 169 have been withdrawn. Why have they been withdrawn? Why are they not part of the projects submitted? Because people were steered the right way in the beginning so that they did not waste their own time or the time of the department and the ACCs.</para><para>I seem to recall the member for Wills being astounded that the previous Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services who oversaw Regional Partnerships changed the departmental recommendation on 11 occasions. That is incredible. That is 11 out of 674 projects—something under two per cent. We are a government; we are not a part of a department. If departments got everything right all the time then we would not have governments. We are elected to do a job. The minister or the parliamentary secretary is elected to make an assessment. I think two per cent or 11 out of 674 is such a low figure that, given most projects and most ministerial intervention, it almost does not exist. The statement by the member for Wills would be one of the most ridiculous statements made in this House for a long time by anybody—shadow minister or otherwise.</para><para>I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the opposition—be it the new Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wills or anyone else—are simply trying to divert the attention of Australians from their own troubles by attacking one of the most successful programs around at the moment. It is also very sad that they choose to attack a project which is bringing so much help to so many people.</para><para>When local governments, communities, charitable organisations and corporate citizens are throwing money into projects around Australia at a rate of $3 for every dollar the Commonwealth puts in, I do not think that sounds like a program that is being rorted. That sounds like a program that is needed and that is doing one heck of a job around Australia. It is an active program; it is working; it is popular; and it is a proven process.</para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, let me tell you as someone who administers that process that it is exhaustive. The way that projects are given due diligence—given that we are very aware that we are dealing with tax dollars from people who obviously are not going to benefit from Regional Partnerships—is an exhaustive process.</para><para>I also think it is particularly sad that in this chamber we hear members of the opposition drag up the names of departmental officials who work their guts out and who do a hell of a job. The opposition could not care less whether that is embarrassing to a person who has done nothing but their job and who has done it well. It is very sad to drag up their name in the public arena; it is a shame. In fact, I think it is disgraceful.</para><para>We are talking about a program which delivers jobs and which helps restructuring, health and services. The member for Wills seems to have left us for the moment. He does not like to listen to anybody, except himself. I would like to challenge him on a few projects. The Flat Bottle project is in his own electorate, strangely enough. I would like to hear him tell those people that he does not support the $150,000 of Regional Partnerships funding for the Social Firm Management Group for the Flat Bottle Co. project. I would like to hear him go to the member for Grey's electorate in South Australia and say to PY Media that he does not support the PY Network project in one of the most disadvantaged areas in Australia. I would like him go to the town of Cobar in my electorate and tell the people there that they do not need a medical centre. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>95</page.no><name role="metadata">Kerr, Duncan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KERR</name><name.id>RH4</name.id><electorate>Denison</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have seen the purported defence of the indefensible. There is no doubt that the Regional Partnerships program was massively rorted. It is a disgrace of public administration. Look at the simple things that have been established. There is the conflict of interest in the office of the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Mr Crooke was employed in her office whilst also making representations on behalf of a beneficiary in the A2 Milk scandal. Look at the instances where the minister overrode the department, with no rationale being established. It is entirely contrary to the way in which the AuditorGeneral said these matters should be administered. Look at the absurd malapportionment and the inexplicable distribution of the funds across Australia.</para></talk.start><para>We have reached a point where, for the first time, Australian parliamentarians who travel to Papua New Guinea will not be able to adopt any superior airs when they look at the schemes that have been adopted in Papua New Guinea for discretionary funds—where each member of parliament is given discretionary funds to allocate as they will—because in this country the government is allocating funds as it will, with entire indifference to its opposition. Where the government spent money in Labor seats, it did so to secure victory in marginal seats—Bass is the best example. The government did not distribute funds fairly across the board to seats; it did it with an eye specifically to its own electoral advantage.</para><para>What about the extraordinary way in which the latest scandal has been revealed about Tumbi Creek? The member for Dobell announced that program about a fortnight before an application was made. I call that the Nostradamus defence—the capacity to look into the future and anticipate an application being made and the minister approving it. I suspect that the member for Dobell is actually the secret author of `Mystic Medusa',<inline font-style="italic"></inline>the horoscope that appears every weekend in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline>. He wrote his own horoscope in the last issue on 5-6 February. The member's birthday makes him an Aquarian. This is his horoscope:</para><quote><para>The usual old <inline font-style="italic">merde</inline> disguised as a New Deal. ...

The grant was to clear the blockage at the mouth of a creek—$1.5 million to dredge that sand out and take it to a tip. But what happens between the seeking of the grant and its request is massive rainfall, so the mouth of the creek is unblocked. There is no requirement to do the dredging—a problem because, plainly, the council anticipated that they would have to seek a reallocation of the funds. But what happens? The minister's office intervenes to tell them, `Don't do that because, were you to do that, we would have to reduce your funding or you might not get it at all.' So there is a conspiracy engaged in wherein the council is asked to provide false information about the state of the creek. </para><para>What is this akin to? Even assuming there was some propriety in the grant, is it not like the situation where a person discovers a theft of their property, makes an insurance claim and then, perhaps a fortnight later, discovers that he actually misplaced that which he had claimed—but there is a conspiracy between him and his friends not to disclose that to the insurance company? Is that not fraud? Of course it is. And it is fraud not only with respect to our common understanding. Plainly, were these facts to be established as we understand them—in a debate such as this we can only hypothesise rather than make direct allegations—there are a number of offences under the Criminal Code which appear to be apposite. Section 134.2, on obtaining financial advantage through deception, sets out the fault elements of that crime. The physical element is that the `Defendant induces a person to believe a thing is true'—that is, that the creek is still blocked. The fault element requires `Intention', and plainly there was intention. For the physical element that the representation is `False', the fault element requires `Intention or Recklessness'. The physical element is that `A third party obtains a financial advantage from a Commonwealth entity'. The fault element ultimately requires `Dishonesty'.</para><para>Assume for a moment that there was doubt about the applicability of that section; there could hardly be any doubt about the applicability of section 135.1, `General Dishonesty'. General dishonesty simply requires in the physical element of conduct that the `Defendant does something' with the `Intention (of dishonestly obtaining a gain from another person who is a C'wealth entity)'. When we speak of `conduct' and `doing things', remember that the Criminal Code defines conduct and engaging in conduct as either performing or omitting to perform an act. So remaining silent when you know that the department believes the creek is still blocked, or putting forward representations to the effect that it remains blocked when you know it is not, clearly comes under that heading.</para><para>Then you have provisions under section 135.2, `Obtaining a financial advantage'. Those provisions state:</para><quote><para>The following elements are for the offence of obtaining a financial advantage for <inline font-style="italic">another</inline>:</para><para>1. Physical Element (`conduct')<inline font-weight="bold">	Defendant induces the C</inline>'wealth entity to do something</para><para>Fault Element 	Intention</para><para>2. Physical Element (`result of conduct')	A third party received a financial advantage from the C'wealth</para><para>Fault Element	Knowledge or Belief (that the third party is ineligible to receive that financial advantage)</para></quote><para>Of course, there are other offences, such as conspiracy to defraud when conducted not by a single person but, as it appears in this instance, by a number of parties engaging together to have the Commonwealth make payments to which they are no longer entitled. Section 135.4(1), conspiracy to obtain a gain, and section 135.4(7), conspiracy to influence a Commonwealth official, would apply.</para><para>Then there are provisions in relation to false or misleading statements and applications. There are a number of different offences in relation to that. But, if you make a statement with the intention to do so, if that statement is false and misleading, if that statement omits a matter or thing and you have knowledge of that, and if you have made that statement in relation to an application for a claim for benefit or you are reckless with regard to that, then you commit that crime. Under section 137.1 `False or misleading information', there are a number of provisions about simply giving `information to another'. The intention must be to provide that information, where the information is `false or misleading' and omits a `matter or thing', you have knowledge of that and the other person is a Commonwealth entity. </para><para>There are serious matters that not only this House but no doubt law enforcement will be looking at to examine whether or not the matters described in this House today are made out. But the Prime Minister, like Diogenes, walking around the stews of the National Party seeking the honest man, seems blind to the obvious. Not a single sparrow will fall. Not a single minor minister will be drawn into a breach of the ministerial code.

Harold Wilson famously said that a week is a long time in politics. Well, if a week is a long time, what a difference four months make. Four months ago all members of this House would have been actively engaged on election day. In 45 minutes time, the first results would have come through from Tasmania. It was the day that the Australian people cast their judgment on who they wanted to lead Australia over the next three years.</para></talk.start><para>I remember the message at that time was that Labor was ready to lead. What I found during the Christmas break and over January was that one of the questions that constituents would pose was: `What if Labor had won?' It is worth thinking about: what if the Labor Party had won? Usually that question elicits chuckles and a little bit of mirth. Other constituents have said that one of the great joys in life for them is waking up, listening to the ABC news, lying in bed in the morning and just chuckling at the latest episode in the saga and soap opera that is the Australian Labor Party.</para><para>One of the key questions that was asked and answered during the federal election campaign was: `Who do you trust to manage an $800 billion economy?' Our message very consistently was: it takes focus; it takes discipline; it takes a good record to run a complex, large Australian economy. People cast their judgments. Politics is a competitive business and the job of the opposition is to mount the argument that they could administer the country and the economy better than the government. As I said, people actually stop and say, `What if the Labor Party had won?' As we have seen the last four months unfolding, it is worth thinking about how Labor would have responded to the tsunami, for example. How would Labor have dealt with some of the challenges that are facing the Australian government now?</para><para>During the election campaign I found, like all members, that there were a couple of conversations that really stuck in my mind. One came fairly early in the campaign when a gentleman rang me and said that his father had always told him that he would be quite happy to have a Labor government but they were no good on foreign policy and they were no good on finance. I thought that sounded like our campaign and I said: `When did your father say this? That's incredible.' He said, `My father died in 1952.' What it shows you is that there are some perennials in Australian politics that do not change. Labor, in the view of the population, is always suspect on those issues. The issues in 2004 were the economy and national security. </para><para>This is a MPI on the subject of administration. It is worth going back and looking at Labor's track record on administration. I found it an amazing conjunction of events when we had the devastation of the tsunami on 26 December 2004 and then on 1 January 2005 the National Archives released the cabinet records from 1974. Of course, one of the things in 1974 was Cyclone Tracy on Christmas Eve. John Menadue reported that Gough Whitlam was reluctant to return from an overseas trip. His quote went something like: `If I have to put up with the—expletive deleted—caucus, I will have my trips.' It was a reminder of how 30 years ago a previous member for Werriwa dealt with a natural disaster. It was a reminder of how a Labor government approached a natural disaster in Australia. People are welcome to draw their own conclusions there.</para><para>More recently, we can go to the Hawke-Keating years. Another one of the key questions—and Labor is trying to morph it into something else—was, as we asserted, that interest rates are always higher under a Labor government. That was what we said, and Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, is trying to say that we were talking about the movement of interest rates. All we said was that interest rates are always higher under a Labor government. That is because the trade union movement has too much influence in the Labor Party and because Labor governments spend more than they collect. Those are the principal reasons. Interest rates reached 17 per cent under the Labor Party and averaged 12 per cent. That was over the Hawke-Keating years.</para><para>Of course, the famous example of maladministration that everyone knows about was the whiteboard affair—the sports rorts affair—in which the administration was so slack that there were no records, and a channel of money was funnelled into Labor Party electorates. That was now 11 years ago. Centenary House is another example of a Labor rort where taxpayers' money has been channelled back into the Australian Labor Party to fund their election campaigns.</para><para>There have been some allegations about regional programs. The member for Wills made some allegations that the majority of funds flow to coalition electorates. There is a very good reason for that: the majority of rural electorates are held by the coalition. Out of 45 rural seats, 38 are held by the Liberal Party or by the National Party. If you add in provincial seats, almost three-quarters of them are held by the Liberal Party or by the National Party. I think an assertion was made that there was a very low number of applications coming from Labor Party seats. A very good question is why? We used to hear a bit from the Labor members for McMillan, Braddon and Paterson. They used to be trotted out as representatives of rural and regional Australia. Why were these Labor members not generating applications in their electorates? Labor used to hold seats in regional Australia. During the Hawke-Keating years from 1983 to 1996 I think they held as many rural and regional seats as the Liberal Party and the National Party did. People showed what they thought about that. People showed what they thought about their work level, their representation and their ability to deliver for their electorates when they tossed them out in 1996.</para><para>This shows that coalition members are much more in touch with the needs of their communities and they are much more active in supporting community-driven projects. Eight hundred applications came from coalition electorates compared with 205 from Labor electorates. What were the Labor members doing? I know that many members on this side who represent rural and regional areas go to a lot of effort to try to get their community groups to put in applications. We have heard a little bit about a creek in Dobell. We did not hear much in this MPI about the turtle interpretation centre which the Labor Party committed $1½ million towards. It had already secured funding from the state and local government authorities. No approach had been made to the Australian government, yet the Labor Party announced $1½ million to the turtle interpretation centre. Of course, they matched the funding for the creek in Dobell. They announced $150 million for a rail line in Richmond, $1 million for a national centre of democracy in Ballarat, $10 million for a national museum in Cairns, $1 million for something in Bundaberg, $3 million for Thuringowa and $6 million for the Rockhampton showgrounds. What applications were put in? What costings were done? In conclusion, it is the job of the opposition to hold the government to account, but the Labor Party's track record is very poor. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Officially opened in 1918, Australia House has served Australians at home and in the United Kingdom without interruption since that time.

Australia House is therefore a prestigious and centrally located asset well worth preserving.</para><para>While the building has been well maintained over its lifetime, changes in internal functions of accommodated staff and environmental effects over almost 90 years have rendered it inevitable that a substantial refurbishment is required.

The works now proposed are those priority areas remaining, comprising external works to the three building core light wells and internal works to the fourth-level accommodation of the Australian Defence staff. </para><para>The light wells are the most difficult areas of Australia House to access and the areas most in need of refurbishment to overcome water ingress and general facia deterioration. A substantial temporary structure will need to be erected to provide access. The level-four works are intended to occur concurrently in order to get the maximum use out of this structure. This not only achieves a reasonable construction synergy, but it also avoids logistic and security concerns that would otherwise be associated with having to access level four internally through Australia House. The scope of the proposed works will include the following:</para><para>	erection of a temporary scaffold and hoist structure outside Australia House, and inside the light wells, for movement of personnel, equipment and material;</para><para>	construction of temporary accommodation on the top building floors for Defence staff while their fourth level is refurbished;</para><para>	refurbishment of the fourth level of the building, including base building services and fit-out, after Defence staff have temporarily relocated;</para><para>	refurbishment of the light wells, comprising replacement of single glaze windows and frames with double glaze units of similar appearance, repair and replacement of damaged brickwork, face tiles and cast iron pipe work, and high pressure cleaning generally; and</para><para>	removal of scaffold and hoists after completion of refurbishment works.</para><para>The estimated cost of the new proposal is $11.98 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, these works are planned to commence in May 2006 and to be completed by mid-2007.

This is a critical piece of regional and national infrastructure. I simply say to the Howard government: quit playing politics with it and get on with the job. I have one other piece of advice for the minister and the government: good public policy outcomes and strong partnerships with other levels of government are never achieved in a lasting sense when one key party is motivated by vindictive ideological obsessions.</para></talk.start><para>It has been a strongly held belief of mine that Australia's transport infrastructure is a major determinant of its economic growth. That is why I have despaired at the wasted years of the Howard government in this very important area of public policy. In my shadow ministerial portfolio responsibilities I have often taken a particular interest in the struggle by rural communities for road funding. One such involvement in recent years was with the community of Ungarra on the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia to secure funding to complete a local road for that community. I note that the Eyre Peninsula was recently devastated by bushfires, with significant loss of life, and I wish the people of Ungarra well in their recovery from the bushfires. They are proud, resilient and decent country people, and I am sure they will come through this disaster with a stronger community.</para><para>In my own community in the Geelong region I am very proud of the achievements of past and present Labor governments, both federal and state, in ensuring that the region's transport infrastructure positions the Geelong area for future economic growth. It was a federal Labor government that contributed funding to the dual carriageway on the Bellarine Highway which now services Leopold, Drysdale, Clifton Springs and other coastal towns on the Bellarine Peninsula. It was a federal Labor government that contributed substantially to the dual carriageway between Geelong and the Great Ocean Road at Torquay, which has underpinned massive tourism and residential growth along the Great Ocean Road. It was the Bracks government and the federal opposition, led by Kim Beazley at the time, that made the public financial commitment to the third lane on the Princes Highway between Geelong and Melbourne, forcing the federal coalition to match our funding commitment. It was the Bracks Labor government that was the first to commit funding to the Geelong bypass. I commend the contributions of my state Labor parliamentary colleagues and their efforts in securing that commitment, which was the catalyst for the eventual commitment made by the Howard government. Transport issues have dominated the Geelong political scene over the 11 years I have been the member for Corio, and I have been pleased to play my part, on behalf of my constituents, in the lobbying efforts to secure funding from all levels of government for these important projects. </para><para>We on this side of the House will be supporting the broad intent of this legislation. Why wouldn't we? After all, we went to the 2001 election with a detailed proposal for a national land transport plan. There are several key proposals that have formed the core of Labor's policy in opposition since 1996, and we intend to insist on them again during this term—namely, the setting of national transport infrastructure priorities for road and rail, the pursuit of an integrated planning approach to the land transport task, the construction of genuine partnerships with other levels of government to achieve national outcomes, the pursuit of a long-term funding framework that exists beyond the half lives of governments at various levels and the integration of the transport task with other social and environmental objectives.</para><para>The past behaviour of the Howard government in this policy area gives the opposition grave concern about the administration of AusLink and transport policy. We are not convinced that the government is really committed to a national land transport plan and funding according to agreed priorities. We have little confidence that the government will not rort substantial slabs of the land transport budget for its own political ends, as has occurred in other regional programs—as, dare I say it, revealed by the Leader of the Opposition today in question time. Even a cursory reading of the minister's second reading speech indicates that there is significant potential for the government to rort the land transport budget again.</para><para>There is disturbing evidence of the government's intention to once again dodge its fiscal responsibility in the transport area and cost shift to Labor states in a systematic way. It is also disturbing to note that, in order to peddle its own ideological obsessions and prejudices, the government intends abusing the important partnership required with state Labor governments to undertake these projects. The Victorian government did not come to the table with over $190 million worth of funding for the Geelong ring-road project and make the federal contribution contingent on certain provisions if funding was to proceed, so why is the federal government seeking to do that with state Labor governments?</para><para>The government's use of its purchasing power to achieve its ideological objectives in the construction industry through its so-called code of practice is a case in point. This code of practice has no legislative sanction and can be changed at whim by the government. There is no independent review of the code's application within government and its potential impact on legally certified agreements struck under the Workplace Relations Act, and there is no independent review of the impact on employers who wish to tender for projects but have struck such legal agreements that may be non-compliant with the code. Yet the government has been prepared to put in jeopardy key infrastructure projects for the Geelong region—and others—for the sake of pursuing its own ideological obsessions and political prejudices.</para><para>With regard to Australian agriculture and fisheries, the efficiency of the road transport task is critical to the long-term prosperity of many of our key rural industries, such as meat, grains, sugar, dairy and horticulture, and to rural communities which depend on them for their ongoing viability. The nation's export performance and competitiveness in agriculture depends heavily on the achievement of greater efficiencies in the transport task. We do expect that in regional areas the government will fund key land transport infrastructure projects that will deliver over the long term the sorts of economic efficiencies that underpin our great rural and fishing industries and lead at the end of the day to greater prosperity for all Australians. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>106</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2237">AusLink (National Land Transport—Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004</inline> underscore Labor's concerns about this government's approach to management of the nation's infrastructure and to management of Australia's economy more generally. This is a government where political considerations take priority over considerations relating to Australia's national interest. It is a government where short-term fixes take precedence over long-term economic and social needs. It is a complacent government that wants to take credit for our current prosperity—which is the fruit of a long period of reforms—but has neither the vision nor the backbone to take the decisions that will build Australia's future prosperity.</para></talk.start><para>It is interesting that more and more often in the community now people are accepting the view that our long period of prosperity is in large measure a product of the decisions—controversial and difficult in their day—that were taken by the Hawke and Keating governments. This government has benefited enormously from that prosperity and now it has squandered it. In all the indices of those measures that we put in place when we were in office you can see that Australia is going backwards where we once went forwards. The figures associated with exports show under this government a rate of growth that is half what it was when we were in office. Research and development funding in the business sector collapsed for the first few years of operation of this government. It is only just beginning to trend upwards now, while all our competitors have been on a non-stop trajectory upwards. There has been a collapse in skills—and in traditional areas that has been worst of all.</para><para>As it is with infrastructure, so it is with training. This government loves the political atmosphere. It is tremendously good with words and political positioning but appalling with the delivery of outcomes. In the skills area, for example, we had the modern apprenticeship training system, which simply concealed the collapse of traditional trades. And now, if you go to the mining companies in my home town, they will not have a conversation with you about indiscipline in their work forces; they will say to you very directly, `We will not invest and we cannot invest because we cannot get a work force.' They cannot get it here and they cannot bring it in from overseas. It is not available—the welders are not there; the electricians are not there. An electrician in a Western Australian mining town now will earn between $150,000 and $200,000 a year. The mining companies have no capacity to do the work that they need to do, because they do not have the resources that need to be there to do it.</para><para>The other area is national infrastructure, and this comes back to this bill. The OECD report that was out last week simply repeats what I have had to say in my opening remarks on this bill. That OECD report was very critical of this government. It was critical of this government in two key areas: skills, which I have already mentioned, and infrastructure. It is not as though money is not spent; it is just how it is spent. Again, it is not part of a national plan targeted to real areas of need; it is part of a national scheme of pork-barrelling targeted at political concerns of the Commonwealth.</para><para>You cannot do this over a lengthy period of time without the nation paying a penalty. Day by day, we are hearing more about the crisis in infrastructure facing this nation. We hear about problems that are emerging in the crucial infrastructure networks that help make Australia efficient and competitive in the global economy—problems such as roads, ports, water, communications, energy and other crucial aspects of the nation's infrastructure. We are facing serious economic constraints; the long-term effects of years of short-term, politically driven policy making are beginning to hit home. </para><para>That is why I want to comment on this bill. Rather than coming to terms with the nation's infrastructure problems and the lack of strategic planning that has caused them, this government now plans to make matters worse. As the member for Wills said in his comments to this House yesterday, this is the latest instalment in a sorry tale of the progressive collapsing of the nation's infrastructure spending into a series of National Party slush funds. We have seen it before. In the environment we have seen it with the Natural Heritage Trust. In communications we have seen it with Networking the Nation. In roads we have seen it with Roads of National Importance. We have seen it with the Regional Partnerships program. And now we see a complacent government planning to entrench its self-interested political decision making in this bill.</para><para>Contemplate the programs I have been talking about—every one of them surrounded by verbiage of fine words and the right sentiments with the mobilisation of community sentiment behind them. Every one of them—to the tune of tens of millions of dollars—is targeted to support a short-term political outcome, not a long-term benefit for the nation. You cannot do that without damaging your country in the end. It is smart politics while it lasts—God knows the government is very rarely internally inspected through the accountability processes around this town—but sooner or later the chickens come home to roost, and they are cackling away in the yard now as we look at the bare bones of the infrastructure strategies of this government.</para><para>Distance has always been a critical element of the story of this nation's development. We have never enjoyed the advantage that many of our trading partners have—of large populations living in close proximity to other well-populated countries providing ready access to markets for their goods and services. We have always lived with great distances between our heavily populated areas and, of course, with great distances between our country and our friends and neighbours. This means that infrastructure planning has always been a crucially important element in our national development. Good planning and prudent investment can overcome challenges of distance. Without clear-sighted, long-term planning for the needs of growing populations and industries, we experience the bottlenecks and strains on our infrastructure that we now face.</para><para>What we need now is a process of objective, long-sighted planning of our nation's infrastructure needs. We need a government that is willing to work cooperatively with the states and act in the national interest. We do not need another slush fund to allow the nation's limited resources to be diverted into white elephant projects in marginal National Party electorates. But that is exactly what this bill proposes with the AusLink Strategic Regional Projects fund. People should learn to be fearful when they hear those sorts of words associated with any government proposition. This $150 million fund gives the minister wide discretion as to how to allocate those funds, on top of the AusLink Roads to Recovery program, which similarly gives the minister virtual free rein on spending decisions.</para><para>Make no mistake about it: this is a story in which there are more losers than winners. When crucial infrastructure funds are being diverted for pork-barrelling for National Party politicians, the people who bear the costs of those decisions are the families spread throughout the vast suburban areas of our major cities. These are the people who live in the exploding suburbs where a failure of long-term planning means that the infrastructure networks and services that they rely on from day to day are too often stretched to breaking point. They have to cope with the daily grind of battling through congested roads where the Commonwealth fails to live up to its national responsibilities. </para><para>People in areas like Campbelltown and Liverpool, which I visited last week, have to put up with overstretched infrastructure every day of their lives—their roads, transport links, hospitals and schools. They are the people who are losing out because this government is more concerned with National Party politicians than with ordinary families. They have to live with the inconvenience and disruption to family life that occurs when you cannot find a bulk-billing GP after hours, when the hospital emergency room is miles away and always overcrowded or when a failure to coordinate transport effectively means that they waste hours every week in travelling between home, work and schools. They are the people who are forgotten when this government is forking out millions of dollars on projects that would not get a look-in if there was a fair, objective process for funding our infrastructure needs. The people in areas like Campbelltown and Liverpool would at least get a fair hearing if we had a fair, objective process for deciding how to allocate our spending on crucial infrastructure. But they do not get a look-in because they are not located in a National Party electorate.</para><para>The government's neglect of those families is so great that with this by-election coming up in the seat of Werriwa it cannot even decide whether it will bother to field a candidate. `We do not need Werriwa,' said some unnamed Liberal Party official. Those opposite do not need an electorate where there may be a challenge to what they nefariously intend to do with the resources that are allocated by the Commonwealth. In Werriwa, people face a choked up M5 motorway each day. That road was part of the former national highway network—the national responsibility that this government is now walking away from. Under this bill the government no longer accepts full responsibility for maintaining those roads. Instead, the government proposes to cap its maintenance commitment to our national highway network at $300 million a year. This government is walking away from its obligations to families in Campbelltown and Liverpool while it sets up a $150 million slush fund for the National Party.</para><para>Our federal system requires national leadership and a national strategy that can ensure that our infrastructure supports our economic growth rather than constraining it. Infrastructure is a linchpin of economic prosperity. That is why Labor advocates a national infrastructure advisory council that can examine and advise on the nation's infrastructure priorities, free of interference from politicians, so that the nation can enjoy the best economic and social outcomes from its infrastructure investments. That is why Labor believes we need a cooperative approach to working with the states and territories to solve infrastructure bottlenecks rather than playing them off against each other, or using roads funding to impose divisive industrial relations ideology on states and territories by refusing to fund road projects unless they follow Canberra's edicts.</para><para>There are elements of this legislation that we support. We support its long overdue attempt to link road and rail planning and to develop integrated corridor strategies for our land transport infrastructure. But we regret the government walking away from its national responsibilities by disowning its full responsibility for what was once formally called the national highway network. At a time when a decade of failed infrastructure policy is now holding our nation back, we can ill afford further indulgence of this government's preoccupation with politics over good policy. We will live for years with the consequences of failing to plan for the needs of our growing industries and our growing families. In infrastructure, bad policy making cannot be reversed overnight. That is why we urge this government to put the nation's interests ahead of its own political interests and to waste no more time in putting in place a transparent, objective and fair framework for meeting Australia's infrastructure needs for now and our future. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>109</page.no><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name><name.id>8K6</name.id><electorate>Hunter</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to continue with the theme established by the Leader of the Opposition. If the <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> were a genuine attempt to improve and better integrate Australia's critical infrastructure it would have the overwhelming support of the opposition, and we would not have a second reading amendment before the House. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, the OECD report and the Reserve Bank statement, both of last week, have identified bottlenecks in our productive capacity as the biggest hurdle to our ongoing sustainable economic growth, as the biggest reason for our poor export performance and growing current account deficit and as applying the greatest pressure of all on interest rates in this country at the moment.</para></talk.start><para>Sadly, it is not the case that this bill represents a real and genuine attempt to integrate land transport infrastructure in this country, and that is very disappointing indeed. This bill is really about two things. First, it is to enhance the government's pork-barrelling potential. Second, it is to enhance the government's ability to shift many of its financial obligations and responsibilities onto the states and, in so doing, to provide themselves with an opportunity on every occasion to shift blame to the states, as they are so known to do. The government has long been frustrated by the constraints of the current road funding arrangements which, in addition to its contribution to the local road components of grants to local councils, leave it almost entirely responsible for the national highway network.</para><para>There is plenty of evidence around the place to back the allegation that this government has been slowly but surely siphoning funding for projects in marginal seats away from the national highway project. It has been taking money away from its key traditional responsibility and spending it on projects under the banner, in particular, of Roads of National Importance. This is not to say that the opposition does not see merit in some of the projects which have been funded under programs such as Roads of National Importance, but we still allege that there are many projects that, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, would never get a guernsey if they were exposed to proper scrutiny and competition from more worthy projects.</para><para>Let me share with the House just one example of the sort of skewed results that you get when you put politics in front of the economic and social needs of the Australian economy. I want to talk briefly about a project in my own electorate, commonly known as the Kurri Corridor, but more recently referred to as the link between the F3 freeway and the New England Highway just north of Branxton. When the Howard government won office in 1996, the F3 to Branxton project was on track and construction funding was expected by the end of that decade. Here we are halfway through the next decade and not one sod has been turned. Even worse, the AusLink proposal to broaden the Commonwealth's responsibilities for road funding at the expense of the national highway project will likely push funding for the F3 link out by another decade. </para><para>Let me share with the House the importance of this road project. It is a project that I have been fighting for since Easter 1988, long before coming to this place, when I was a councillor on Cessnock City Council. In Easter 1988 the then final section of the F3 freeway was opened to a little place called Freemans Waterhole. That became the dead end. From there all of that freeway traffic spilt onto the roads of the local government authority, causing both an economic and a social nightmare. So we as a community started lobbying for what is commonly called the Kurri Corridor. We were successful in getting the community's preferred route option for that project. We were very confident that the case had been made in economic terms to have construction funding allocated to that project by the end of the decade or by the year 2000. Alas, the Howard government was elected. In that first budget of 1996 in particular, it embarked on some massive funding cuts, which was of course very bad news for that project. And the bad news has been ongoing ever since, in particular as a result of the government's ongoing determination to siphon money away from the national highway project, which the Kurri Corridor would form part of, and onto other projects where it believes it can get a greater political benefit.</para><para>The Kurri Corridor would be of great benefit to the Hunter in economic terms, in social terms, in road transport terms and in safety terms. It would rid many towns in my electorate—including the major towns of Cessnock and Maitland and smaller towns like Greta and Lochinvar, which are long-term sufferers—of the heavy vehicle traffic and the noise it creates as a result of the government's failure not to fund this project. I note that numerous economic studies have been undertaken that confirm the fact that, in economic terms, the Kurri Corridor would be of great economic benefit to the Hunter region. It would bring our coal exports closer to the port and it would bring the whole region closer to Sydney. The benefits would also extend way beyond my electorate, indeed into the electorate of the Deputy Prime Minister and member for Gwydir, the architect of this flawed AusLink proposal; and into electorates to the west of mine, such Calare which produces much of the product other than coal that goes through the port of Newcastle.</para><para>So important is the F3 link to our local communities that in recent years a local community group known as `Link or Sink' has sprung up. It has been very active in lobbying both the Commonwealth and the state governments in an attempt to bring funding forward for this important project. Unfortunately, despite the fact that they have had a number of discussions with Minister Anderson and his underlings, they have been given no real hope that the government is about to change its attitude on this subject. The reality is that, under this funding proposal, an important road link such as the Kurri Corridor, which goes substantially if not wholly through the electorate of Hunter, which the government considers a safe seat, is not likely to enjoy priority over some of these other projects the government has in mind, which of course run through either opposition held marginal seats or government held seats. That highlights a major flaw in this bill, and conjures for us again the prospect of the National Party being ongoing in its attempt to allocate money not on the basis of economic or social benefit but on the basis of political benefit. If the government believes there is a better funding model for road funding, one that better delivers outcomes, then the opposition would be prepared to support it. If broadening the Commonwealth's responsibilities delivers better results, we would be more than happy to support the proposition. But such a plan is not contained within the bill before the House today. </para><para>Let me turn to some other bottlenecks that the Deputy Prime Minister has been making a habit of waxing lyrical about in this place in recent times: the bottlenecks involved in some of our important port facilities. AusLink is apparently about dealing, amongst other things, with local land transport links to ports. There is not much point getting the land transport links to the ports right if there is undercapacity at the ports themselves. These ports, like the port of Newcastle, are so critical to Australia's economic wellbeing and have been subject to some consideration in the Reserve Bank and OECD reports and by a range of economic commentators around this country.</para><para>The port of Newcastle is the lifeblood of the Hunter in economic terms. It is the nation's largest coal port, but one that is currently choked. It is choked to the point that it is not unusual to see 50 ships sitting off the coast of Newcastle—a problem that is costing the coal companies operating in the Hunter Valley up to $100 million annually in demurrage charges. To get the capacity of the port of Newcastle to a point capable of coping with the current demand for export coal out of the Hunter region—from the current 90-odd million tonnes to 120 million tonnes—would require expenditure of some $300 million, or just three year's worth of demurrage. Where is the economic sense in all of that?</para><para>I will not say that the port of Newcastle is unique, because similar problems exist off the Bowen Basin in Queensland, but it is a monopoly. The Leader of the Opposition just made the point that the Hawke-Keating reforms of the 1980s and 1990s, in particular the competition reforms of the 1990s, are what gave this economy the economic boost that has been sustained in all that time and which is now in its 14th year. It was competition reform that gave the Australian economy a boost over major economies like the US throughout the 1990s, and it is competition reform that has allowed the economy to better deal with capacity constraints and to better avoid upward pressure on interest rates. Unfortunately, there is not much competition in the port of Newcastle, and that is much to the detriment of the Hunter region's economy.</para><para>The monopoly port facility is run by Port Waratah Coal Services. Who owns Port Waratah Coal Services? Mainly, in majority terms, it is owned by the coalminers Rio Tinto and Xstrata. Despite the dramatic growth in demand for export coal in recent years, much of which was easily predicted given the growth in China in particular, no real expansion in capacity has taken place at that port. Instead, Port Waratah Coal Services has successfully secured authorisation from the ACCC to put a quota system in place which restricts competition by allocating a share of port capacity to each of the producers who seek to use it. This of course is a practice which (1) disadvantages the smaller producers, who are of course on all current predictions the producers seeking to grow fastest and (2) has the effect of allowing the big companies which control PWCS to stall capacity investment. It is obvious.</para><para>The quota system is an advantage to the big players for three reasons. One, the big players, subject to ACCC authorisation, effectively set the rules. Two, the big players can meet their contracts from other global projects. In a sense, they can sequence their projects and source coal to meet their contracts from other global projects. It is a luxury not enjoyed by the small players like Excel Mining, Centennial Coal, Donaldson Coal et cetera. Three, demurrage charges are a much greater burden on the smaller players than they are on the big players like Xstrata and Rio Tinto. </para><para>While this quota system has been responsible for reducing the queue of ships sitting off Newcastle in recent months, the quota system allows the monopolist PWCS, owned by the big players Rio Tinto and Xstrata, to defer investment to take advantage of the situation at the expense of smaller producers, the economy of the Hunter region and the national economy. The quota application provided the government, through its agency the ACCC, with an opportunity to secure commitments to that investment before issuing the authorisation. Smaller coal companies do not have a problem with the quota system per se, but they see it as an opportunity, a tool, used by the big players to defer investment, and they do not appreciate the fact that the government has failed to use the authorisation as an opportunity to at the same time get a commitment on investment. As I said, the Reserve Bank has identified these bottlenecks as being crucial to the ongoing economic capacity of our economy as a whole.</para><para>During question time, the Deputy Prime Minister in particular—and I think the Treasurer on one or two occasions—has been very quick to try to shift the blame for the problems in our port capacity onto the state governments. With respect to the Newcastle port, this is grossly unfair. The New South Wales government has done all in its power to improve the situation. The Deputy Prime Minister likes to remind us that ARTC has now taken control of the rail infrastructure that takes the coal to the port of Newcastle. I too think that that is a good thing and I look forward to this government, as the majority shareholder in ARTC, continuing to apply sufficient pressure on that organisation to invest what is necessary to get the rail infrastructure up to an appropriate capacity.</para><para>But there is no point in getting rail capacity up if the port capacity does not increase as well. The chain is only as strong as its weakest link. It is no good the Deputy Prime Minister coming in here crowing about what has been done in terms of the ownership of the rail infrastructure while refusing to concede any responsibility whatsoever for what is happening at the port of Newcastle. My message to the Deputy Prime Minister is this: `It's competition, stupid.' It is competition and it is only the Commonwealth government that can sort out the competition issues we are experiencing at the port of Newcastle.</para><para>We should not be surprised that the government is hesitant to do so. We have seen this government's attitude towards competition policy. We have seen its failure to take on another round of competition reform. We have seen its failure to embrace with any urgency the recommendations of the Dawson review, although it did not mind embracing pretty quickly those recommendations that suited the big end of town such as the softer merger laws. It has been reluctant to pick up the Senate committee's recommendations on a range of issues, but in particular on the strengthening of section 46.</para><para>I read a very interesting speech by Saul Eslake of the ANZ Bank recently—a speech he delivered to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission—in which he made the point, which I made earlier, that it is competition policy in this country that has given us our big lift in economic growth and capacity; it is competition policy that has given us a greater buffer against higher interest rates when we are reaching capacity in the economy; and it is competition policy that we must continue to pursue. It is now up to the Commonwealth government to have a good, hard look at what is happening in the port of Newcastle and act for a change to assist us in our problems there and to recover the $1.4 billion in sales we are losing annually as a result of its inaction. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>113</page.no><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WINDSOR</name><name.id>009LP</name.id><electorate>New England</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to support the <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> and the cognate bill, but there are a number of concerns I would like to raise in relation to infrastructure generally. Before getting into my speech, I would just like to comment on one of the things that the member for Hunter raised. I would agree with him in relation to the port of Newcastle. As a state member in the north-west and New England area, and as the federal member for New England, I have had quite a lot to do with the Newcastle Port Authority, the Newcastle Business Chamber and other groups in Newcastle that are interested in the development of the port and the relationship that the port has with the various areas around it. The member for Parkes is here, too; he would be well aware of the relationship between Dubbo and the central west area and Newcastle and also the Tamworth-Gunnedah area in relation to Newcastle.</para></talk.start><para>One of the things that really needs to be addressed is the infrastructure needs of the Newcastle port and the importance it has to the northern and western parts of inland New South Wales. One of the pieces of infrastructure that is not mentioned in the AusLink documents is the Murrurundi tunnel. I am sure the member for Hunter would agreed that that is a very important piece of infrastructure that needs to be addressed at both a state and a federal level if we are going to develop the port of Newcastle and the coal industry north of the Liverpool Range in the electorates of Gwydir and New England.</para><para>Having said that, obviously I think all of us in this chamber recognise that the AusLink white paper and subsequent legislation do an important thing. They attempt to integrate the road and rail networks nationally, and I think that is significant in itself. We will all argue that there is not enough money in there, and I would argue that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services has probably exploded the funding arrangements in terms of how many Snowy Mountain schemes are actually in this particular document compared with what is historical fact, but there is no doubt that there is more money and there is an attempt to integrate road and rail and, in some cases, to link in with the ports. I would say that there is not enough in relation to Newcastle, of course, but I congratulate the minister on having a national approach to this particular problem. It is a problem in that we are continually building roads and rail has been ignored, and I think we are seeing the added impact of some of the road building schemes without looking at integration totally.</para><para>I am a supporter of the inland rail link that has been talked about for some years, and I think that this document, particularly the agreement through the Australian Rail Track Corporation—the $872 million that was signed off between the state of New South Wales and the Commonwealth government—is an important move forward in relation to that particular agenda. But we really do need the government to put more in and react in a much more positive sense than it has in recent years to that particular project, because, if we are talking about infrastructure in inland Australia, we will have to have a rail system that can actually work right across the inland of Australia and take goods into Darwin and back to Sydney and Melbourne.</para><para>There are a few comments that I would like to make. Obviously I do not think anybody in this parliament would suggest that the funding arrangements in AusLink are sufficient. I do not think any member of the government would argue that the infrastructure needs of Australia are going to be covered sufficiently in AusLink, otherwise there would not be members of the government—and one of those members of the government, the member for Parkes, is at the table at the moment—arguing that there is a need to sell a very important piece of infrastructure, Telstra, to fund other infrastructure. I have very great concerns that an agenda is building up in parts of regional Australia—and Dubbo is one of those areas where that agenda is growing—where moves are afoot to actually push for the sale of Telstra so that road and rail can be sufficiently funded in regional Australia. That says to me straightaway that, even though this legislation recognises the need to integrate and the obvious benefits downstream of integration, there is not sufficient money. </para><para>I caution Mr Roger Fletcher, one of the major sheepmeat processors in Australia, about being used as a puppet in developing an argument to sell Telstra to fund other infrastructure. It is an insult to country people to say that they cannot have the infrastructure they require and that the only way they will get it is to sell some other infrastructure. I think all of us would know that in this century telecommunications is going to be the most important piece of infrastructure in regional Australia. It is the very piece of infrastructure that negates distance as being a disadvantage of living in a country area. It removes smallness as being a disadvantage in terms of size. If you get equity of access and equity of cost—and I believe you have to have government involvement to achieve that, because the private market will not provide that—only then will country people out-compete their city cousins in terms of their location. I think a nasty agenda is being developed—and I would caution the member for Parkes on his involvement in it—to promote the sale of a significant piece of infrastructure to fund another piece and to say to people that that is the only way they are going to get sufficient funds to provide the infrastructure that they require. We all know that there are other ways of achieving those outcomes.</para><para>One of the other issues that I would raise is the Roads to Recovery program, and I compliment the minister and the government on it. I think there is no doubt that that has been a successful program. I was very pleased—just prior to or during the election campaign, I cannot remember quite when—to see that the government moved back to a similar system, where the full $300 million was going to be treated on an equitable basis across all local government areas. The original proposal was that $200 million would be treated under a similar formula to that of the previous Roads to Recovery program—a successful program in my view—and $100 million would be opened up to the discretion of government.</para><para>We have had a debate today and there is a debate going on in the Senate about these sorts of discretionary lumps of money. There is no doubt that there is a politicisation of the process or, at best, that it allows possible tampering, even though that may not be going on to the extent that some people might like to think it is. Those sorts of schemes allow people to develop their own thought processes about transparency, whereas the original Roads to Recovery program was a very fair program. It went out to all local government areas. The locals made the decisions on the ground. There was no way that the bureaucracy or the state government—and I applaud the federal government for bypassing the states in that sense—or the minister could have an impact on the direction of that funding. I think Roads to Recovery is a successful program and should be looked at as a bit of a model for other programs in the future. </para><para>I remember being involved as a state member, again, in the campaign to get more money for local roads. I will just highlight for a moment the importance of unity. I note with great interest that the Australian Local Government Association is currently embarking on a program to achieve one per cent of income tax to go back to local government—a much more transparent scheme, again, that would allow some growth as the economy grows, as the income tax receipts grow, so that more of that money could flow to local government—rather than the very archaic system we have now. I congratulate the President of the Australian Local Government Association, Councillor Bell, for his initiative. I urge all members to support that initiative, because if it is supported through a whole range of organisations I have no doubt that it will be successful.</para><para>I will just take people back to the genesis of the Roads to Recovery program. A meeting was held from 5 to 8 March 2000 in Moree, in the current minister's seat of Gwydir. He was the minister then, too, I think. The meeting was under the auspices of the Deputy Prime Minister; he had encouraged the meeting to occur. It was about creating solutions: a National Rural Roads Congress. It was put on under the auspices of the Australian Local Government Association.</para><para>One of the things that disturbed me at the time in the advertisements for and promotion of the program—and the Deputy Prime Minister was involved in its promotion—was as follows. This congress was coming together to look at how road infrastructure was going to be funded in the next 20 to 50 years, at how this money was to be provided. That was a very worthy question. But one of the things that concerned me greatly, and I was critical at the time, was that in the documents that were circulated a statement was made: `It is clearly not going to be funded from current sources of funds.' That was suggesting to local government, from the federal level, that local government would receive no more money from the fuel tax receipts than they were getting, so the congress should look at other ways of achieving funding arrangements: private-public partnerships and those sorts of arrangements. The signal was sent from government at that stage: `Don't expect any more from fuel taxation receipts.'</para><para>I think at that stage something like $800 million of Commonwealth funds was being spent on roads. Obviously that was not enough. That is a bit over 2c a litre at the bowser, and I think we are all aware that we are paying 38c and then there is GST on top of that. It was a little bit over 2c a litre, and the government was saying at the time through the Deputy Prime Minister: `Don't expect any more.'</para><para>The Australian Local Government Association did not accept that. To their credit, they argued that more receipts should be made available, particularly for local roads, as there was a real maintenance problem developing in terms of infrastructure. To their credit, they were able to come out with what is now the very successful program called Roads to Recovery.</para><para>I raise that today because I think the Australian Local Government Association, having been successful in getting the Roads to Recovery program up, are now on the cusp of getting another successful program up if they really lobby hard and apply the political pressure that is required. I encourage them to do that to the best of their intent, because the one per cent income tax receipts that are being talked about are a very worthy goal. </para><para>When you start to look at the $11.8 billion included in this AusLink funding program, there are a number of things that suddenly jump out at you. The government is arguing that, because Roads to Recovery was not planned to go beyond this year, it is not in the forward estimates, and therefore it is new money if it goes on into the future. So the government is arguing that that is part of the growth in infrastructure funding. I would dispute that. I would suggest that that is clouding the issue somewhat.</para><para>Another thing that is clouding the issue is in relation to the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme. Most people would remember that the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme was put in place to alleviate the disparity between country and city fuel prices that would have occurred when the 10 per cent GST was imposed. The government, assisted by the National Farmers Federation and others—and the member for Parkes was involved at that time as a farmer representative—quite rightly argued at the time that country people should not be disadvantaged in any way by the imposition of the goods and services tax. The Fuel Sales Grants Scheme was put in place to neutralise the impact, by way of location, of a government tax.</para><para>The government has decided to remove that money. Although it is $270 million a year, it is accounted for in this document as $810 million over three years. That means that country motorists will in a sense be paying for that portion of the $11.8 billion. Country motorists will pay from one cent to 3c a litre more for fuel at the bowser because of the removal of this scheme. Even worse than that, out of the $810 million that country motorists used to receive, there is no guarantee at all that that money will go to country projects. There is no focus in the documents that suggests that country people will be advantaged by that $810 million.</para><para>In the few moments left to me, I will briefly run through some other infrastructure needs that I believe have an impact on the New England and north-west area and should be looked at in terms of future estimates of infrastructure requirements and costings. I spoke earlier of the Murrurundi rail tunnel and the Newcastle port. Bolivia Hill, south of Tenterfield on the New England Highway, has to be one of the major traffic hazards that is left on the national highway. I do congratulate the government for the work that it has been doing on the New England Highway. A lot of good work is being done there, but I do not see Bolivia Hill factored into the AusLink arrangements and I think it should be. There is also the inland rail initiative that I spoke of before. There is currently some examination within the electorate of a transport hub to be based at Glen Innes. If that is seen to be feasible, it may well require the extension of the rail line to be reopened above Armidale through to Queensland, which would be a major initiative for the electorate of New England but it would impact on other areas.</para><para>I would like to spend a moment on the strategic regional projects in the AusLink papers. There has been some adjustment of the total sums of money but, effectively, it is $30 million a year for five years and is there for various councils that may come together and decide they have a worthy regional project that needs greater funding than would flow through the normal Roads to Recovery or other government grant processes. I think it is a good idea, and I encourage the government. I think the Tenterfield Council is coming to this House next week to talk to the minister about the road from Legume to Woodenbong in my electorate. It is on the northern extremity. The Woodenbong point is 128 kilometres from Brisbane, but it has an enormous impact on a number of electorates in southern Queensland, the Darling Downs, the top end of New England and, very importantly, the Lismore and Casino areas on the coast of New South Wales. It is one of those classic cases where funding of this strategic project would advantage a number of councils, two states, and a number of members of parliament from different backgrounds. I would urge the minister to look very closely at that project because it is a very worthy one. </para><para>I spoke briefly a moment ago about the Australian Rail Track Corporation, the $872 million negotiation that took place between the state and the Commonwealth governments last year and the final sign-off. The AusLink documentation seems to suggest that the Commonwealth government is putting $872 million into that arrangement. In fact, it reads that way, but it is not strictly true. The federal government is only putting $150 million in; the New South Wales government, $50 million; and Pacific National, $50 million. The federal government is arranging for debt funding of $620 million. Although I recognise the importance of the agreement, I think the minister should be careful in articulating that there has been $872 million injected at a federal level. That is not the case at all. I am also aware that the ARTC is to manage the remaining lines—the non-Hunter, non-metropolitan lines—in New South Wales. I would like the minister to articulate in his reply what that will mean for some of the smaller lines that will not become part of the national network. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>117</page.no><name role="metadata">Livermore, Kirsten, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LIVERMORE</name><name.id>83A</name.id><electorate>Capricornia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In this debate on the <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> and related legislation there is really no debate at all about the crucial need for investment in land transport infrastructure in this country. Australia's vast size and its dependence on bulk commodity exports means that a safe and efficient land transport network is a central part of maintaining our productivity and our standard of living. In areas like the one that I represent, the condition of our road and rail infrastructure has a direct bearing on everyday life. The road and rail links between the coal and beef producers and their processors and markets are make-or-break for these industries. That is why it is so important for this government to understand the needs and the potential of these industries in regional Australia and to support their growth through strategic investment in relevant infrastructure.</para></talk.start><para>Just as important is the way that the state of roads impacts on the daily lives of people in my electorate and their access to services and opportunities. Whether it is for medical treatment, education or, in the case of many coalminers, the trip back and forth from their homes on the coast to their jobs at the mines, the state of roads is an issue of equity, safety and quality of life. As I said, there is no debate at all about the importance of infrastructure in this country. Rather, the debate on this bill is about how to achieve a strategically planned and integrated land transport network that delivers the best possible returns on the government's infrastructure spending.</para><para>Labor do not believe that AusLink as it is proposed in these bills achieves those aims. That is why we intend to refer the bills to a Senate committee for further investigation and why we have moved the second reading amendment, which calls on the government to maintain funding responsibility for the construction and maintenance of the national highway, to establish a national infrastructure advisory council and to extend the criteria for Roads to Recovery to include public transport, cycling, walking infrastructure and regional airport runways.</para><para>Australia's infrastructure needs have come into sharp focus in recent times, but it is for all the wrong reasons. The government, of course, wants to tell us about the bright new future for infrastructure planning and investment under AusLink, but it still has an awful lot of explaining to do about exactly what it has been doing—or rather not doing—for the last nine years. What has it been doing while capacity constraints have developed at our ports, holding back vital export industries like the booming black coal industry in Central Queensland? What has it been doing while bottlenecks have grown worse on our major rail freight routes? And what has it been doing while funding for the national highway has failed to keep pace with the need for upgrading and maintenance? </para><para>While we are debating these AusLink bills the Australian economy is starting to feel the results of this government's failure to invest wisely and strategically in the important transport infrastructure that our industries need to remain competitive and to make the most of opportunities that are presented by a buoyant world economy. It is not just the opposition that is making these points. Earlier this week the Reserve Bank warned about the risk of increased inflation and rising interest rates as a result of infrastructure constraints and skills shortages. Infrastructure constraints and skills shortages do not materialise overnight, so it is obvious that this government has been asleep at the wheel for the last nine years. It is a government that is happy to cash in on the hard and meaningful reform work that the last Labor government put in place—a government that is happy to take all the credit—but which is too complacent and self-satisfied to face up to the challenges that needed to be addressed in order to maintain the improvements in productivity and competitiveness that Labor achieved in the Australian economy.</para><para>While the government wants to sell its AusLink package as a sign of its commitment to strategic and integrated planning and funding of infrastructure, we in the Labor Party see plenty to be sceptical about based on the government's dismal performance over the past nine years, as evidenced by the pressure points in our economy that were obvious to everyone, it now seems, except the Howard government. The concerns that the Labor Party have about AusLink in its current form are reflected in our second reading amendment. For example, we are concerned that, for all its talk about integrated planning and funding partnerships with the state governments, is AusLink really just an exercise in cost-shifting and stepping back from the Commonwealth government's responsibility in the area of land transport? That certainly seems to be the case when it comes to funding for the national highway.</para><para>AusLink requires the federal government to determine a national land transport network consisting of nationally significant road and rail links, but it does not identify the national highway, nor does it specify federal government responsibility for construction and maintenance of the national highway network. So where is the certainty for the people of Central Queensland—who rely on the Bruce Highway as a lifeline to Brisbane for so many business and personal needs—that funding will be there for its maintenance and upgrading as population pressures increase traffic on that road? Instead of the Commonwealth accepting its responsibility for that vital piece of national infrastructure, it has now capped its contribution to maintenance of the national highway at $300 million per annum for the five-year life of the current AusLink agreement. The maintenance shortfall, which can only get bigger, especially in a fast-growing state like Queensland, is left for the state government to pick up.</para><para>Labor's election commitment to fully fund the national highway would provide much more certainty to the people of my electorate that the Bruce Highway would receive the attention it deserves as the major transport link along the Queensland coast. We are also concerned that this package builds in the same flaws and opportunities for pork-barrelling that we have seen demonstrated in the Regional Partnerships program. Funding for projects in key elements of the AusLink package—the AusLink strategic regional projects funding and a proportion of the Roads to Recovery funding—are left to the minister's discretion. Where have we heard that one before? Just a couple of hours ago in question time and in the censure motion debate. Prior to the last election $93 million of strategic regional projects money was already committed, and you can bet that the minister will be busy exercising his discretion in favour of his National Party mates in key seats in the lead-up to the next election. </para><para>Labor take the infrastructure needs of this country much more seriously. We actually believe that when it comes to investing millions, if not billions, of dollars in infrastructure it is the national interest, rather than narrow self-serving political interests, that should prevail. That is why Labor have taken the proposal for a national infrastructure advisory council to the last two elections. When it comes to building a strategic and integrated transport network in Australia we want decisions to be based on the best possible independent advice, free from political interests. Our plan for an advisory council would see infrastructure investments guided by objective advice from industry, consumer and expert representatives based on transparent social, economic and environmental criteria.</para><para>Given the way that the funding for the Regional Partnerships program was distributed, the people of my electorate of Capricornia are well entitled to ask whether the Howard government can be trusted to distribute the funding for AusLink equitably across all of Australia. Across the local government areas of Central Queensland there are 146 roads which have been identified as roads of regional significance by the Central Queensland Regional Road Group. The people of Central Queensland would like to be assured that these roads, which local councils have determined hold the key to future development in Central Queensland, will be given the necessary priority to ensure that they are upgraded to a standard which will support the opportunities we are creating in the mining, agriculture, defence and tourism industries.</para><para>In the Livingstone shire alone, 39 roads have been identified as vital to tourist development on the Capricorn Coast, as well as the much needed improvement of the access roads to the Shoalwater Bay defence training area. I particularly wish to dwell for a moment on these access roads to Shoalwater Bay. I am sure that all in this House are aware of the importance of this facility to our defence forces and our allies who use the Shoalwater Bay training area. We on this side of the House believe that the access roads to Shoalwater Bay are not only roads of regional significance but, in fact, roads of national significance, due to the critical role that Shoalwater Bay plays in our national defence capability. This is why prior to the last election we committed an Australian Labor government to spending the $15 million necessary to ensure adequate access to the military training area.</para><para>The Shoalwater Bay training area is widely recognised as one of the best military training facilities in the world. This facility is the only area in Australia where the Army, Air Force and Navy are able to engage in joint military exercises. This area is used extensively by Australian forces and those of our allies the United States and Singapore. Training exercises and joint manoeuvres are held at Shoalwater Bay regularly. </para><para>The Shoalwater Bay training area is serviced by four road routes. These are the Stanage Bay Road, better known as the grey route; Raspberry Creek Road, better known as the green route; Rossmoya and Canal Creek roads, better known as the brown route; and Farnborough and Byfield roads, better known as the blue route. It is worth noting that the blue route is a Queensland Department of Main Roads road and is sealed up to Byfield. So one could argue that the Queensland government has done its bit for national security and it is now up to the Howard Government to do its bit by attending to the other three entrance roads to this vital training facility.</para><para>Whilst it is true that the Department of Defence does provide some `make good' funding to the Livingstone Shire Council to assist with road repairs to Shoalwater Bay, undertaking the proposed upgrading works will result in long-term savings of approximately one-third of the annual maintenance cost of the existing gravel roads. This is particularly important with the prospect now of an expansion of military exercises in Shoalwater Bay following last year's signing by the government of a joint training agreement with the United States.</para><para>It is expected that by 2007 the Central Queensland region will be hosting as many as 10,000 US soldiers. It is not good enough for the Howard government to commit our country to such an undertaking without due consideration to the added demands it will place on the infrastructure in Central Queensland. Patch-up money for maintenance of these rural roads will simply not keep up with the demands placed on these roads, and it should not be the ratepayers of Livingstone shire who foot the bill.</para><para>As well as the Queensland government, the whole of the Central Queensland region has invested heavily in infrastructure to support and profit from Defence Force use of the Shoalwater Bay training area. Further infrastructure and development is required to keep Shoalwater Bay training area as a preferred training venue, with the resulting benefits to our regional economy. It is estimated that Defence Force exercises at Shoalwater Bay training area inject $10 million into the regional economy every year. This figure is significantly more every second year, when joint exercises with the US defence forces are conducted. In addition, there are significant multiplier effects to the wider economy of Central Queensland, including an estimated $7 million expended through military tourism in the region every year.</para><para>The people of Central Queensland ask the government to pick up the commitment made by the Australian Labor Party and fund these roads of national defence importance. We ask the government to seal the remaining gravel sections of the Rossmoya Road, Canal Creek Road, the Raspberry Creek Road and Stanage Bay Road to the entrance of the Shoalwater Bay training area. Members of this House may recall, as do the people of Central Queensland, that it was only after the commitment I and the Australian Labor Party made prior to the 1998 federal election to upgrade the runway at Rockhampton Airport that the Howard government finally provided the money to enable the use of Rockhampton Airport by jumbo jets. That was necessary for the continued development and use of the defence training facilities at Shoalwater Bay, and so too is the sealing of the access roads to the Shoalwater Bay training area.</para><para>It is not just in the area of supporting the defence industry and defence activity in Central Queensland that we need assistance from the federal government. As anyone reading the paper over the last couple of weeks would know, the coal industry is also crying out for immediate investment in infrastructure to support that industry. This is necessary for the prosperity of not only Central Queensland, which is the biggest coalmining area in Australia, but also the whole of our national economy. </para><para>That brings me to another important transport project in my electorate, the so-called missing link that would open up access between the whole of the northern Bowen Basin coalmining region and the Abbot Point coal-loading facility at Bowen in North Queensland. Construction of 70 kilometres of railway line would link the Newlands-Abbot Point line with the Goonyella-Moranbah line, providing an integrated transport link between the Bowen Basin coal industry and the port of Abbot Point. With an estimated construction cost of $72.2 million, it was determined by a Queensland Rail feasibility study in 1993 that sufficient benefit could be generated to justify investment in the rail link. There is no question, 12 years on from that feasibility study, that the time has come for the federal government to look very closely at this project, which would solve many of the problems facing the coal industry right now.</para><para>As I said, we have seen stories in the paper day after day this week on the capacity constraints that are becoming very obvious at the coal-loading facilities in Newcastle and, closer to my home in Central Queensland, at the coal-loading facilities of Hay Point and Dalrymple Bay. Coal production is booming in the Bowen Basin and there is huge demand for Australian black coal. The advantages of building this rail link between the Newlands-Abbot Point line and the Goonyella-Moranbah line are that it would open up the Bowen Basin to Abbot Point and that it would create an alternative coal export facility to those at Dalrymple Bay and Hay Point, which are constrained not only by their capacity constraints but also by weather. Abbot Point is much more reliable throughout the year and is not as affected by the weather as Dalrymple Bay and Hay Point are. There is capacity in the current design of Abbot Point to double the size of the Abbot Point coal-loading facility, and I am told by the Bowen Collinsville Enterprise organisation that that could be done at a much lower cost than an equivalent expansion at either Hay Point or Dalrymple Bay.</para><para>The constraints on export capacity are really holding back activity in the coal industry at the moment. It is crazy for the government to overlook this relatively minor infrastructure project—just 70 kilometres of rail line that could greatly expand the coal exporting capacity of Central Queensland. The Bowen Collinsville Enterprise organisation has, in conjunction with the Bowen Shire Council, done an awful lot of homework on this project, as has Queensland Rail. I think it is very much the time, when we hear about the constraints on our coal exporting capacity every day, to look closely at this project under the strategic regional projects element of AusLink, to see what can be done to support this project so as to open up not just the coal industry but also possibilities for other bulk commodities that could be shipped out through Abbott Point. The project would be of enormous benefit to the town of Bowen, which has done it tough in the last few years, and also to its neighbouring town of Collinsville, which is an important coalmining centre some 80 kilometres south-west of Bowen.</para><para>In conclusion I want to urge the government to take seriously the approach that the Labor Party has taken to this bill. We are not blocking the bill in any sense. We have moved the second reading amendment in very good faith, putting forward ideas that we have come up with for important infrastructure development in this country, proposing a way forward to make sure that infrastructure investment is done in a way that is not partisan in any way and is coherent and strategic—ensuring that it is not done to favour one interest over another. Our proposals for a national infrastructure advisory council are all about taking the politics out of infrastructure spending and I think that is very worthy and something that the government should look at very closely. Our other proviso on supporting this bill is to subject the measures to a Senate inquiry. That is also done in a very constructive spirit, because we realise at the moment that we have had too little focus on infrastructure spending in this country and that is now really creating bottlenecks that can jeopardise our economic prosperity into the future. We are supporting the bill, but I call on the government not only to look closely at the projects that I have highlighted in my electorate but also to consider carefully the recommendations that come out of the Senate inquiry, because the inquiry will be carried out in the national interest. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>122</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2237">AusLink (National Land Transport—Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004</inline> have the capacity to impact on the future prosperity of Australia. This can be seen from the contributions made by speakers on both sides of the House. From an economic point of view no issues are more important than those covered in this legislation. This package of bills provides for an integrated network of road and rail transport linkages of national importance and includes funding provisions for programs under a new national land transport network, black spot projects, a new discretionary fund for strategic regional projects and continuing projects under the Roads to Recovery program. In making my contribution to the parliament, I will talk about a number of those.</para></talk.start><para>It is imperative that Australia has the best, most effective and efficient transport system available. To achieve this it must embrace all forms of transport and of infrastructure supporting our transport systems: rail, road, sea, public transport, airport runways, cycleways and walkways. Some of those are not covered in this legislation. One of the glaring omissions from this legislation is any mention whatsoever of shipping and port infrastructure, because that infrastructure is vital for our nation. I find this most disturbing. After all, Australia is an island nation and shipping and our ports are vital to our future. I support the linkage of road and rail, but I believe it would enhance our transport system if the issues surrounding shipping—such as our ports—were also covered by this legislation.</para><para>I commence my contribution to this debate by highlighting the importance of our national transport system or network. Unfortunately, I believe the government has been negligent and has ignored the best options—the best practice—on the grounds of opting once again for a political approach and grubby politics. I do not believe that when it comes to something as vital as this we should be indulging ourselves in grubby politics. I come to this place having looked at roads from three different levels of government. I have been fortunate enough to be a representative at local government level, state level and now federal level. At each of those levels the issues surrounding roads and road infrastructure are amongst the most important issues.</para><para>Back in 2001-02, I conducted a survey of my electorate. I presented the constituents of Shortland with a list of items and asked them to rank them from the most important to the least important. Of all the items that people were presented with roads came out on top as an issue. The road infrastructure within their area was highlighted by 96 per cent of people as being of great importance. This legislation covers a number of areas, and I will spend some time going through them. </para><para>The purpose of this AusLink legislation is to limit the operation of the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 and to remove the ALTD special account. This requires that a national land transport network consisting of nationally significant roads and rail links be determined. This is fundamentally different from existing arrangements as it does not identify the national highway network, which has been an underlying principle in all previous legislation. I find that of great concern. It does not specify federal government responsibility for the construction and maintenance of our national highway network either. I know that many speakers on this side of the House have already highlighted that fact, and we have highlighted it because we see this as the Commonwealth moving away from one of its core responsibilities. The Commonwealth has always had responsibility for our national highways.</para><para>In this legislation, I see the government inching away from its responsibilities. One of the things that always concerns me, no matter what area I am looking at, is the tension between the Commonwealth, state and local government. Each level of government often tries to shift its areas of responsibility to the other. I do not think that is the best solution for the Australian people. I think the best solution is for the federal government to show leadership, and for all levels of government to work together, rather than having a situation where one level of government is seeking to abrogate its responsibilities. I fear that, by not identifying the national highway network and by moving away from its responsibilities for the construction and maintenance of the national highway, the Commonwealth is abrogating its responsibilities. The bill sets out eligibility criteria for different categories of assistance and the matters which may be considered in deciding whether a project or activities are to be approved or funded. It provides conditions for funding. Under the existing arrangements, state and federal governments identify the priorities for federal funding and provide project management. This will change under this legislation.</para><para>One of the things that really concerns me is the discretionary power that the minister will have under this legislation. I know I speak for my colleagues on this side of the House when I say that we believe in accountability and openness. I do not think you can achieve those things where there is a high level of discretionary power. The minister decides how to allocate funds for projects under AusLink strategic regional projects. I fear that can lead to pork-barrelling and the establishment of another National Party slush fund—another fund to re-elect the Howard government.</para><para>The Australian people deserve better than that. The Australian people deserve a government that makes its decisions openly and does not rely on discretionary power. Earlier today we were talking about the Regional Partnerships program. The thing that worries me about that program is that the area consultative committee can make a recommendation and then that recommendation can be overridden by the minister. I do not believe that is good government. I do not believe that is best practice in government. I find it particularly disturbing that one of the projects that has been discussed is Tumbi Creek, which is in the Wyong Shire Council area, which is also included in the Shortland electorate.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Baldwin)</inline>—Order!

But don't be too sensitive about it, because I am actually talking about discretionary powers—how discretionary powers work currently and how they will work under this legislation. I feel that, where there are examples of discretionary powers not working properly, it behoves me, as a member of this House, to highlight that fact in the parliament.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The process that was adopted in the development of this legislation was as follows. There was a green paper on 7 January 2002 and, once that green paper was tabled, it was open for comment until 7 February 2003. There were 550 written submissions, from government, industry and the community. The white paper was released in June 2004. The green paper that had a joint working group on AusLink priorities on the national network was established to assist in the development of a possible set of national infrastructure priorities for the initial five years. However, the thing that concerns me is that state and territory governments have complained that there was little or no consultation in developing the national priorities for the first five years of the AusLink national land transport plan. This is of great concern because, as I highlighted earlier, the best results are achieved by governments at all levels working together.</para><para>I would like to briefly turn to the white paper. In doing so, I wish to highlight that all the right words are used. The executive summary says:</para><quote><para>The Australian Government is embarking on a far-reaching transformation of the way Australia plans, funds and delivers land transport infrastructure.</para></quote><para>Planning is good. The words used in this executive summary are good, but what about the details that underline this? The executive summary continues:</para><quote><para>Under AusLink, the Australian Government takes a strategic approach to Australia's future ...</para></quote><para>A strategic approach is the approach that needs to be taken. The document goes on to say that it does this `by ensuring that the nation's land transport network meets future challenges'. But I really do not think that this legislation does that, and that is the sad part of it. It is a missed opportunity. The government had the opportunity to do that, to ensure the development of the type of modern infrastructure that would take Australia into the next century, that would ensure sustainable economic growth, and I believe it has failed. It has failed to a large extent by slipping into the mire of partisan politics yet again, just as it did with the Regional Partnerships program.</para><para>I would now like to highlight some of the issues that I see as important and some of the areas where I think the government has failed. I have highlighted the discretionary power of the minister. I do not like that. As I pointed out, that has been well established. You have seen the flaws in that today here in the House, particularly with reference to Tumbi Creek. The Commonwealth is also abrogating its responsibility—the cost sharing with the states for the maintenance of the highway. I feel that that is extremely flawed and a very bad step by the government. I think the government really needs to revisit that.</para><para>The Labor Party, as the member for Capricornia pointed out so admirably in her contribution to the parliament, has gone to the last two elections with a proposal for a national infrastructure council. That would get around some of the problems that I have with this legislation. It would be an open and accountable way to look at developing the priorities that are in the nation's interests. It would be a way to ensure that those statements that I read out from the white paper—about our need to plan and deliver the funds in the appropriate way—actually get put into practice so that we do get a land transport network that meets the future needs of Australia. We need this to happen without political interference. </para><para>We do not need any more National Party slush funds, we do not need any more re-elect Howard slush funds; we need good quality infrastructure. We need investment in the development of this infrastructure and we need that to be determined on a needs basis and in a way that will ensure that Australia has the best infrastructure—infrastructure that meets the needs of our nation. We need a cooperative approach that includes all levels of government, the community and business. I do not think that that can happen under this legislation. I did refer to the flaws in that process in relation to the first five-year AusLink national land transport plan and the fact that the states and territories were not happy with the consultation in relation to that and their ability to have input into that. We need quality infrastructure. We need this to work for the future of Australia. We need it for economic growth and sustainable regional communities. Unless we have the right sort of infrastructure and the right sort of transport system, that will never happen.</para><para>As I have already highlighted a number of times, we do not want any more National Party slush funds. We do not want any more pork-barrelling. We do not want a new Regional Partnerships program. We do not want any more partisan decisions: the kinds of decisions that have happened with the National Trust program or with the Roads of National Importance—or with Networking the Nation, in the communication area. We want that to stop. We want decisions made on merit. We want our infrastructure to be invested in and developed in the interests of the nation, not in the interests of partisan politics. That approach is not in Australia's interests. Parochial politics do not lead to a sustainable economic future. It is time the government moved away from that approach and developed an approach that is for all Australians and in Australia's interests.</para><para>Governments have choices. This government can choose to govern for all Australians and in the best interests of our nation or it can choose to adopt a small-minded partisan political approach: I fear that this legislation has the potential to allow the government to again make the second choice. We need quality infrastructure. We need infrastructure for the future—to ensure a strong future. We do not want to end up as a second-rate nation.

I hope that the comments I make might suggest some sort of way whereby we may get a process—and I think we have already got it with the Grants Commission allocating Roads to Recovery money—where money is allocated on a fair and reasonable basis depending on need, length of road, population and the actual need of the local government area in question. </para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> puts into place the mechanism for the government's new integrated approach to the planning and financing of a national land transport network. That is a very good thing. The plan outlined in the bill is the culmination, we are told, of three years of consultation and development and allocates some $11.8 billion in federal funding over five years for both road and rail and for an integrated land transport network. The government has identified a doubling in non-bulk freight, a doubling in interstate road freight and a 40 per cent increase in passenger travel to 2020.</para><para>I am happy to see the additional $872 million to be invested in the Australian Rail Track Corporation for the eastern seaboard north-south rail links over the next five years. I remember evidence given to the `Time running out' inquiry that I was a member of a couple of years back. That was an inquiry of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services. If I remember correctly, Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin, you may have been a part of that. Time after time, there was evidence of the parlous state of our rail network. I seem to remember a story about our main Brisbane-Sydney line where the guard had to reach out and manually trigger the signals at certain points along that link. This was in 1999-2000. The network has been Third World standard in many respects, and anything that can be done to bring that link alone up to world-class standard must be welcome. We must strike a balance between rail and road in this country and allow rail to catch up. It is way, way behind. I believe that this national land transport bill goes a long way towards improving that critical state of our rail network.</para><para>I want to concentrate my remarks on the aspects of the plan supporting local and regional infrastructure. In January last year, the minister announced the continuation of the Roads to Recovery program, which was due to expire at the end of financial year 2005. The 2004-05 budget provided for the allocation of another $1.2 billion to the program over four years. That consisted of $200 million per year to be allocated under the Roads to Recovery formula to fund local roads and $100 million allocated on a competitive basis for projects of economic and social significance.</para><para>The AusLink white paper released in June last year split this funding into two streams, providing $400 million for Strategic Regional Projects and $800 million for the AusLink Roads to Recovery program. During the election campaign, the coalition announced that it would top up funding available to councils under the Roads to Recovery formula to its original $1.2 billion over four years. Councils quite rightly saw the white paper's two-stream formula as cutting their guaranteed allocations by a third. This has been corrected. In the same policy document, `Building our national transport future', the coalition undertook to provide Strategic Regional Projects funding of $120 million over the same period. I am not quite sure whether this money replaces the $400 million allocated to the strategic regional projects in the white paper or whether it is in addition to it. I hope that the minister or his advisers might be able to clarify this situation.</para><para>Roads to Recovery has been an extremely important program for councils in my electorate, providing councils with much-needed extra road funding since its introduction four years ago. What is more, unlike other programs which have had a good airing in recent days, it has been allocated by an independent process, through the Grants Commission, according to a clear formula. It has enabled the replacement of old and dangerous bridges, the upgrading of intersections and the widening of narrow country roads. The number of signs around my electorate, and no doubt others, is testament to the worth of the projects to which that money has been put. </para><para>But there are figures that show that we are only beginning to catch up with the slow decline in infrastructure spending in this country over the last 20 years, particularly in roads since 1990. The figures in the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> quite clearly display the fact that in real terms—and I know the GST has become available to the states in that period—Commonwealth funding has slipped from $1,597.3 million in 1993-94 dollars in the 1990-91 year to $1,358.2 million in 2002-03.</para><para>It can be rightly said that, while very welcome and necessary, the Roads to Recovery program has but helped catch up, to a degree, with the clear falling away in funding over that decade and longer. It is welcome, and this national AusLink program will go further towards redressing that fall off in national infrastructure spending over the last two decades. The AusLink strategic regional project is designed to support local transport projects of regional, economic and social significance, as described in the white paper. In brief, the idea is to target local transport links that are significant to major transport corridors that are part of the national network that form an important part of the economic development strategies within a region, provide access to export related transport networks and enhance access for regional communities to services and employment.</para><para>I would hope this includes a serious examination of transport links from western New South Wales to the ports of Newcastle and Wollongong so that we do not put all our planning energy into the Sydney corridor, of which I will say a little bit more in a moment. There is a lot of evidence coming from and supported by gentlemen such as Professor John Chudleigh, who has had a lot of input into the government's regional strategies over the years. He and others are very concerned that we are thinking in terms of east-west development, particularly in New South Wales, and we are not looking enough at our north-south links, particularly in the tableland area just west of the Great Divide. There are links, such as that through Canberra, Goulburn, Bathurst and north to Mudgee, that have been improved significantly in recent years with Roads to Recovery and black spot funding. It is a bit like the Telstra network—it is a super highway in parts, a reasonable highway in parts and virtually a dirt track in others. It needs to be linked up into one major link so that we can deflect a lot of transport pressure from the Blue Mountains corridor to the ports of Newcastle and Wollongong. I note an earlier contribution—I think it was from the member for Hunter—which said that we must also be looking at integrating our transport and infrastructure strategies to include our port infrastructure.</para><para>That brings me to the national infrastructure report that was done by a parliamentary committee and delivered in February 2000. There were a couple of key recommendations. I believe the most important one in fact was recommendation 6:</para><quote><para>... that the Commonwealth Government establish a National Infrastructure Advisory Council with expertise from the public and the private sectors, to facilitate the efficient and equitable provision of national infrastructure by both public and private sector stakeholders. </para></quote><para>Many recommendations in that report referred to the need for the national infrastructure council to be set up as an advisory council to report, through the Council of Australian Governments, to ministers responsible for regional development on strategic infrastructure—where it is taking place and what the needs are—and looking forward 10, 20 and 30 years rather than succumbing to the temptation to look only at the electoral cycle. The AusLink program is the beginning of that sort of structure, but it lacks the vision that this report recommended following the input of Fred Argy and others, along with councils all over Australia, infrastructure experts and tax experts looking at the potential for superannuation funds to become involved in national infrastructure and so on. There is an element of that structure in the rail portion of this AusLink program, and I know the minister said that he did not want to have another advisory group involved in the process. But I and the committee, made up of members of this House from right across the political spectrum, saw enough evidence to suggest strongly that it should be a prime consideration in any transport policy in this country.</para><para>As others have said, there is far too much discretionary spending in this particular bill. There are real concerns in my mind about some of the approval of projects processes built into the bill. I notice under division 1, approval of projects, it is commented by those researching this bill that the minister's determination is not required to be tabled in each house of parliament and is not subject to disallowance. That may or may not attract the interest of the minister, but I would like him, if he would, to explain exactly why that process is in place. There is a comment at the end of the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> that details of projects approved under the national plan are not required to be tabled or published, with the exception of the Roads to Recovery program. Given that there is a large discretionary fund for competitive tendering, it does suggest that there could be a temptation—not necessarily with this minister or government but in years ahead—for any minister in a tight election process to use a discretion that is not in the best interests of regional or national infrastructure priorities and wise spending of scarce public moneys.</para><para>I would like to comment on a couple of the contributions that councils in my area made to the AusLink green paper. The Central West Regional Organisation of Councils, CENTROC, said amongst other things in its submission:</para><quote><para>It has long been recognised that transport will play an increasing part in the area's development.</para></quote><para>CENTROC stretches from Condobolin to Wellington, Forbes, Cowra and all the councils in between to the Blue Mountains. The submission continued:</para><quote><para>Intermodal points are now established at Blayney and Parkes and others are planned. Road conditions, as mentioned elsewhere in this submission, impeded the realisation of the area's potential. All of the local government areas in CENTROC have an umbilical cord to Sydney via the Great Western Highway and this road is the dominant form of transport and clearly needs the most focus.</para></quote><para>While the Dubbo-Sydney link is on the AusLink program, there seems to me to be a strong need to look at those links to the ports of Newcastle and Wollongong and to also see a greater commitment to the Mid Western Highway and those other links between Bathurst, Cowra, Parkes and the Blue Mountains.</para><para>In recent days a draft of the Blue Mountains highway proposal has been released. This is being conducted by consultants for a tri-government Blue Mountains access group, which is headed by the Hon. Ian Armstrong and includes members of all political parties, state and federal; Independents; and party representatives west of the Blue Mountains. It has detailed a four-lane divided highway which would commence south of Windsor and approximate the Bells Line of Road up to the Newnes Plateau then follow the plateau north of Lithgow and intersect with the Great Western Highway at the Mudgee turn-off. </para><para>Members may remember some suggestions that were pilloried by the state Labor government where tunnels under the mountains were suggested. There have been any number of suggestions of how this can be done and how the sand derived from those tunnels from the sandstone curtain could be used for Sydney's building boom in the years ahead. I think the money involved in such a project would absolutely preclude its completion on a cost-benefit ratio at this point. However, we now have—it will not be released in detail for another six weeks or so—an engineering and economic report that suggests that an above topography route, which is 94 kilometres in length, is feasible. It will run into some quite significant opposition through the fact that six kilometres of it will touch on the declared wilderness area of the Blue Mountains National Park. That is going to be a major hurdle, no doubt.</para><para>I put it to the House that unless there is a `decoagulation', if you like—it is the only word I can think of—of that link across the Blue Mountains, we are going to get gridlock within 10, 15 or 20 years. The central west of New South Wales, and all of those arteries leading into that route across the mountains, carry goods that contribute enormously to the production and the wealth of this country. We must find a route across those mountains that is better than the existing Great Western Highway.</para><para>The government assisted by declaring the Great Western Highway a road of national importance in the late nineties and I think they contributed something in the order of $100 million to help develop that improved access. But the more that route is being improved, the more it is resembling a glorified Pennant Hills road. I have travelled it several times recently. While there is an enormous amount of work being done, it strikes me that with its variation of speed limits—50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 kilometres per hour—it is never going to represent the sort of national highway link that will be required in the years ahead. That begs the question: why don't we look more at the Bells Line of Road option to see if we cannot reach some sort of compromise? The suggested route, as I understand it, goes behind the heritage villages of the Bilpin area. I think it is very much worth investigating. If it gets approval—and there is enormous support for it—then it should become part of the AusLink program and attract significant federal support, as should the upgrading of the rail linkages not only into Sydney but into those ports of Newcastle and Wollongong, as I have suggested.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>129</page.no><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LLOYD</name><name.id>IK6</name.id><electorate>Robertson</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I take this opportunity to thank all honourable members for their contribution to this debate.

They herald the most important change to national land transport policy in the past 30 years. The AusLink program has a generational commitment to transport infrastructure improvement. It will help deliver on the government's vision for a land transport system that can both meet the challenges of the transport task and make its contribution to a stronger economy. Since coming to office, the Australian government has already taken major steps towards positioning Australia to sustain long-term economic growth. It has significantly reduced public debt by some $70 billion and fundamentally restructured the tax system. High performing land transport infrastructure is a further prerequisite to ongoing improvements in our national productivity and competitiveness as our population ages over the next 20 to 30 years. </para><para>The AusLink initiative introduces a new, modern and innovative approach to land transport infrastructure planning, decision making and funding. It backs these reforms with a massive increase in funding which our sound economic stewardship has enabled us to provide. The overwhelming bulk of the AusLink investment—over $8 billion over the next five years—will be directed to the new land transport network. The new AusLink national network brings together for the very first time previously separated planned and funded road and rail networks into a single, integrated network which will be an essential foundation for a fully effective national transport system.</para><para>The government is providing the platform for the revitalisation of the national rail network. Without an effective interstate rail freight system, Australia's transport system cannot work. For the first time, the Australian government's transport infrastructure funding will be guided and underpinned by an announced five-year national plan. The five-year plan focuses on the highest priority projects that provide economic and social benefits from a national perspective. Importantly, we are also providing a five-year funding commitment which gives certainty to state and local governments, and to transport and construction industries. This is unprecedented and provides for certainty of investment.</para><para>AusLink provides the framework for a planned national system whereby all levels of government will be working to deliver the best transport investment. The Australian government has set out a clear strategic direction which governs the priorities it has established for the next five years. In brief, these priorities are: establishing long-term and integrated planning; improving the eastern seaboard's north-south corridors; improving interstate and interregional corridors; addressing urban congestion on key freight links; utilising technology where it can enhance and improve efficiency, safety and security on the national network; improving safety and security overall; protecting the Australian government's past investment in major links; and supporting regional and local economic growth. At the project level, the program provides for substantial investment in Australia's most important land transport links, including the F3 and Pacific Highway, the Hume Highway, the Sydney to Brisbane and Sydney to Melbourne interstate railways, and the Bruce and Calder highways.</para><para>The program enables many critical projects to be undertaken—the Geelong bypass, the Peel deviation in Western Australia, the Port River expressway in South Australia and the Bridgewater Bridge in Tasmania are just a few examples. It is absurd to suggest that investment in such projects will not yield major economic benefits at both the national and local level. This will be the first time that a national government will be putting in place arrangements that look beyond the current five-year program through a development of long-term corridor strategies developed against a 20-year time horizon. Corridor strategies will provide the basis for identifying shared government priorities and provide non-government stakeholders with the opportunity to contribute to the longer term planning and funding of national land transport infrastructure in Australia. </para><para>Corridor strategies will be supported by a range of rigorous studies to determine corridor needs, deficiencies and future priorities. They will focus on identifying the best solution to the transport needs of each corridor, irrespective of the transport mode. Industry and stakeholder consultation will be a critical source of information. Work on developing corridor strategies in conjunction with the state and territory governments will commence in earnest this year. Initially we will focus on a small number of pilot studies and expand into larger groups as we gain experience.</para><para>There will be a nationally consistent project assessment methodology to inform the development of corridor strategies and the assessment of future project priorities. This methodology has been developed in conjunction with the states, territories and local government and has now also been agreed to by Australian Transport Council ministers. This is a key reform. The government has set up the framework for evidence based national investment. AusLink is about ensuring the nation invests in its best projects.</para><para>The opposition has made a number of proposals in its second reading amendment. The first relates to the discontinuation of the national highway system. The opposition amendment is critical of the discontinuation of the 30-year-old national highway system funding arrangement. The bill provides for the government to move beyond the single mode-focused national highway system to a broader and integrated network of nationally important road and rail links. A number of opposition members made comments during the debate which were also supportive of moving on from the old national highway system to a concept of a single, integrated network.</para><para>Under the announced AusLink program, all states and the Northern Territory will receive large increases in funding for construction projects on the national network. It is therefore quite ridiculous to suggest that the Australian government is somehow avoiding its funding responsibilities. The AusLink shared funding arrangements recognise that many projects on the national network as well as having substantial national benefits will also have benefits that are more local in nature. In these cases, funding contributions at both the national and state level are appropriate. The AusLink shared funding arrangements also recognise that the national network now includes links that previously had been totally or partly the responsibility of the states to fund—links that the Australian government previously had no responsibility for. At the same time, the Australian government is continuing to fully fund many projects on the former national highway system, particular those in rural and remote areas. The opposition's position is now an outdated approach to transport funding and, accordingly, the government does not support it.</para><para>The second part of the opposition amendment proposes the establishment of an independent national infrastructure advisory council. Whilst the government's AusLink white paper lays considerable stress on the importance of long-term planning for national land transport infrastructure, it cannot support the opposition's approach. Labor's proposal, which is lacking in any firm detail, is to set up another bureaucratic talkfest that will not provide effective advice on national priorities. Our view is that such advice is unnecessary at this stage, given that the national land transport network is premised on infrastructure investment priorities identified by the state governments. An example is the Pacific and Hume highways. Indeed, our priorities were reached following quite detailed consultation and advice from departments at the state government level. These governments will continue to work closely with us to establish corridor needs and priorities on the national network. </para><para>The AusLink white paper does moot in the future the establishment of a National Transport Advisory Council. The Australian Transport Council, comprising Australian, state and territory government representation, has already agreed to further consider the establishment of the National Transport Advisory Council in the future. If the council decides to establish such a body, it will provide strategic analysis and advice on long-term planning for the national transport system involving all stakeholders, including the private sector.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition is completely wrong in his claims that AusLink is promoting tension between the Australian government and the states and territories. AusLink is intended to promote a cooperative approach between all levels of government in Australia for long-term transport infrastructure planning and implementation. The process that is already underway to establish agreed priorities on the national network is clear evidence of that. As a government, we will not abrogate our responsibilities to take decisions in the nation's best interests. We are setting priorities and making the investment. We work cooperatively with the states, territories and local governments, but we will not agree to Labor's amendment.</para><para>The third part of that second reading amendment is the broadening of the Roads to Recovery funding purpose. The AusLink bill also demonstrates the Australian government's continuing commitment to local communities through extending the very successful Roads to Recovery program beyond its initial time frame of 2005, a program that I recall the Leader of the Opposition called a `boondoggle' when it was first introduced, but it has been one of the government's greatest programs and well received, particularly with local councils throughout Australia.</para><para>I was also pleased to hear that many opposition members are convinced of the worth of this program, which has been, as I said earlier, of enormous benefit to local councils throughout Australia. Local councils know that it is a good thing, and opposition members also know that it is a good thing. In 2004-05 some $253 million is being provided for local roads in the final year of the current four-year Roads to Recovery program. By the end of this current program, some 12,000 local road projects will have been funded. In the four years from 2005-06, and 2008-09, a further $1.2 billion will be provided to local councillors on the basis of a similar funding formula arrangement that has applied under the current Roads to Recovery program.</para><para>That sends a very strong signal that this government is determined to continue to help achieve a vibrant economy and social outcomes for local communities. Councils will continue to have wide discretion in determining the projects to which their formula based applications are applied. The key condition is simply that it be spent on the construction and maintenance of roads. The government's firm view is that the planning and funding of public transport services is a state and, in some cases, local responsibility. That said, it is open to local councils to apply funding to road construction projects which might assist, for example, the efficient and safe operation of road based public transport. Honourable members might also like to note that the definition of a road in this bill already includes a path for the use of persons riding bicycles. We do not propose to extend the criteria beyond those for which we have currently provided.</para><para>Early passage of this legislation will enable local governments across Australia to be given certainty about the future of funding and the conditions applying to this important stream of funding to improve and maintain local roads. I urge the opposition to enable this legislation to pass not only through this House but through the Senate as quickly as possible so that this important program can again be funded for local councils. </para><para>In addition to the $1.453 billion, which will be distributed to councils on a formula basis, $150 million will be provided over the five years from 2004-05 to 2008-09 for local road projects of strategic regional importance. This will include funding for local roads in unincorporated areas. I emphasise that this is additional money. This is new money which is important to local councils. This funding for local roads under the Roads to Recovery money is in addition to the $2.55 billion over the next five years that will be provided to local councils as untied local road grants.</para><para>The government is concerned to see not only effective planning in investment decision making but also efficient project delivery arrangements. The application of the national construction code and implementation guidelines is a key part of the government's drive to improve the efficiency of the construction industry and eliminate uncompetitive practices. It is therefore an important element of the AusLink five-year funding agreements currently being negotiated with the states. I am delighted that the Victorian government has agreed to apply unchanged the national construction code to AusLink projects in Victoria.</para><para>Consistent with the government's longstanding undertaking to consult with the states and territories on any proposed changes to the code, the government will consult with the Victorian government on possible future changes to the code and implementation guidelines. A formal agreement is yet to be finalised where, for the purposes of the code, AusLink funding to Victoria would be considered as one project. Agreement to the code paves the way to settle the bilateral AusLink five-year funding agreement with Victoria. This development follows agreements being reached between the Australian and South Australian governments on joint implementation guidelines that will apply to major AusLink projects in South Australia. I strongly encourage the remaining states and territories to now follow South Australia and Victoria's lead.</para><para>In conclusion, I reinforce that the arrangements to be established by these bills will drive the development of our key road and rail links and ensure that they are forged into one single high performing and safe national network. They will move beyond the entrenched arrangements for separate road and rail funding which hampered rail development, recognise the critical importance of our links to our ports and airports in supporting a globally competitive transport system, and drive the upgrading of local road networks and the development of key regional links. The Howard government is investing in Australia's future. These bills will provide for the planning and evidence based investment decision-making framework which Australia needs. The government will also provide unprecedented levels of funding for our national road and rail infrastructure. I commend both of these bills to the House.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

<inline ref="R2173">Australian Communications and Media Authority Bill 2004</inline> and related bills and to respond on behalf of the opposition. I do so in my representative capacity, representing in this chamber the shadow minister for communications, Senator Conroy, who of course is in the other place. Labor supports this legislation as a necessary first step in addressing the increasing regulatory problems posed by the emergence of convergent technologies. It is a step towards addressing this issue—a much delayed one at that, but in the final analysis it is a step in the right direction.</para></talk.start><para>Convergence is the process whereby digitisation and other technological innovations blur the boundaries between the delivery mechanisms available for services. As a result of convergence, consumers now have a multitude of ways in which to access telecommunications and media services. Today a person wanting to speak to a colleague or friend can choose whether to dial from a fixed line telephone, pick up a mobile phone or have the conversation over the internet through voiceover IP. A person wanting to read the morning news could pick up a newspaper, turn on a personal computer to log onto the net or get up to date by using their mobile phone. The number and variety of such permutations on the delivery of traditional services will only continue to grow with the high pace of technological change inherent in these industries. </para><para>As the march of technological progress continues and the commercial markets for convergent technologies evolve, regulatory distinctions based on the methods by which services are provided will become increasingly antiquated and inefficient. As such, the current regulatory approach in which legislation distinguishes between services based on the methods by which they are delivered—and through which regulators operate along these increasingly irrelevant divides—is in need of reform. To delay, or to only go halfway in these reforms, will inevitably result in the inefficient distortion of the development of markets for services provided using convergent technologies.</para><para>Regulatory barriers may deter businesses from making some commercially viable services available to consumers. Disparities in the regulatory treatment of services may also result in businesses investing in technologies merely because they enjoy a regulatory advantage in the marketplace instead of being superior products or services. These are not good outcomes for the Australian telecommunications and media industries, and they are not good outcomes for the Australian economy or the Australian people. These risks are further exacerbated by the importance of telecommunications and media markets in the modern Australian economy and the rapid pace of change exhibited in these industries.</para><para>Unfortunately, the pace of reform pursued by the government in this area has been light years behind the pace of technological innovation. This legislation is the government's first legislative attempt to deal with these challenges. Not one, but two discussion papers on these issues have preceded its introduction: the first, <inline font-style="italic">Options for structural reform in spectrum management</inline>, in<inline font-style="italic"></inline>2002 and the second, <inline font-style="italic">New institutional arrangements for the Australian Communications Authority and the Australian Broadcasting Authority</inline>, in 2003. It is legitimate to ask why there has been such a delay in implementing a sorely needed and relatively straightforward reform.</para><para>Governments of other countries, governments which are interested in and committed to allowing their countries' media and telecommunications industries to develop free from inappropriate government interference, addressed these challenges half a decade ago. For example, the Singapore government, active in its desire to promote the emergence of strong, local, telecommunications and media industries, undertook a merger of its equivalent regulators in 1999. The United Kingdom commenced a similar process in 1999 and ultimately merged its equivalent regulators in 2002. It is disappointing that it has taken half a decade for the Howard government to even follow the lead set by others.</para><para>As a result of the absence of leadership from the government on this issue, the existing regulators—the Australian Communications Authority and the Australian Broadcasting Authority—have responded to the emergence of convergent technologies in a necessarily ad hoc and reactionary way. This has led to inefficient overlaps in regulation and regulatory responsibility in some areas and gaps in the regulation of others. In its submission to the Senate committee considering this legislation, the Australian Consumers Association stated that the current regime had produced `some weird interim regulatory responses'. The Competitive Carriers Coalition stated: </para><quote><para>The ACA has increasingly been seen as a follower rather than a leader in terms of regulatory guidance and oversight. This has caused significant duplication and regulatory burden on the industry as a whole.</para></quote><para>The Competitive Carriers Coalition went on to describe the regulators' responses to the emergence of a recent convergent technology, voiceover IP telephony services, as being `poorly coordinated' and requiring industry participants to respond to separate inquiries from the ACA, the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Communications Industry Forum. There has also been significant regulatory duplication in the regulation of mobile content, and unjustified inconsistencies between regulatory approaches to content provided over different mediums—for example, in the age verification requirements for adult content on mobile services compared with those of internet services.</para><para>However, after years of this ad hoc approach to convergence, the growing popularity of convergent technologies such as 3G mobile phones and voiceover IP have finally forced the government's hand. Now that these technologies are becoming commonplace, the government could no longer sit on its hands. And so we now have the Australian Communications and Media Authority Bill.</para><para>The bill is the government's first attempt to deal with these issues. The bill provides for an administrative merger of two existing regulators—the Australian Broadcasting Authority, ABA, and the Australian Communications Authority, ACA—to establish a unified communications regulator: the Australian Communications and Media Authority, or ACMA. As an issue of significant importance to the communications sector, Labor has referred this bill to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee for inquiry so that the adequacy of the legislation can be assessed in detail.</para><para>Having said that, I should add that the primary inadequacy of the bill stems from the government's decision that this merger should be of a purely administrative nature. In accordance with this decision, the bill makes only nominal changes to the existing regulatory frameworks for telecommunications and media. The problem with this is that, while merging regulators will result in a unified approach to the administration of existing legislation, in many cases it is the substance of the underlying legislation itself that is causing inefficiency and regulatory uncertainty. In order to effectively deal with convergence, we should be moving towards a situation in which, all things being equal, regulation is technology neutral. This will require legislative, not simply administrative, reform. While the majority of submissions in response to each of the discussion papers that have been issued by the government have called for a comprehensive review of the underlying regulatory regime in this way, the government has taken the easy option and dodged the hard work necessary to implement the reforms.</para><para>In addition to the fundamentally inadequate philosophy of the bill, Labor also have a number of concerns about how the merger of the Australian Communications and Media Authority will occur. Firstly, we are concerned that allowing the authority to organise itself into divisions and to retain the current bureau offices of the ACA and the ABA will mean that the new authority will be a merged regulator in name only and will in fact continue to operate as two distinct regulators divided in accordance with the delineations of the legacy regulators. We will be exploring whether the organisational and geographic division of the new authority permitted under the bill will undermine the objectives of the merger, and we will pursue this through the Senate inquiry. </para><para>Another of Labor's concerns is that the explanatory memorandum and comments from the former Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, indicate that the merger will be revenue neutral. This represents a significant organisational failure on the part of the government. We find it difficult to understand how the government could not manage any cost savings from a merger that would presumably integrate finance, human resources, and IT support functions of the ABA and the ACA. Telecommunications carriers who have made submissions to the Senate inquiry have rightly pointed out that this is a disappointing result for carriers, as under the current regulatory regime carriers bear the cost of the new authority's telecommunications functions through carrier licence fees. In light of the government's obligation to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent in the most efficient manner, the failure to achieve cost savings from this merger is a poor outcome.</para><para>Finally, I note that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has stated on a number of occasions that the government intends to engage in a review of the effectiveness of the telecommunications regulatory regime in conjunction with the performance of a scoping study for the full sale of Telstra. While it may suit the government's interests in maximising the share price of Telstra prior to sale to hold a private inquiry into the efficiency of the regulatory regime, a far better outcome could be achieved if this review were held in public and enabled interested parties to make submissions on the record on this matter. The government has missed a perfect opportunity to hold such a review as part of the consultation process for this bill.</para><para>The government is creating a new regulator for the communications sector six months before it intends to fully privatise Telstra. Why doesn't the government investigate whether the powers it is providing to the new regulator are appropriate to enable it to achieve its aims in the context of a fully privatised Telstra? Does the introduction of this bill at this stage mean that the government is satisfied that the new authority's powers are sufficient to regulate a fully privatised Telstra, or will we have to go through yet another review in order to ensure that the new authority is able to effectively deal in a regulatory sense with a fully privatised Telstra? The failure of the government to address these issues as part of the introduction of this bill again demonstrates the short-sightedness of the government in this area. Having said that, I also say that Labor supports the package of legislation. The package of legislation represents a modest improvement on the status quo, and I commend the package of legislative measures to the House.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>137</page.no><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TUCKEY</name><name.id>SJ4</name.id><electorate>O'Connor</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I apologise to the House.

We thought that you might have wanted to come down. I thought that the spokesman for the Labor Party, the member for Perth, would have had more to say but he spoke for only 10 minutes. This is major legislation—legislation that I recollect was called for by the opposition who were highly critical of some aspects of the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the major regulator. This legislation amalgamates the Australian Broadcasting Authority and the Australian Communications Authority. They will become the Australian Communication and Media Authority, the ACMA, by 1 July 2005. </para></talk.start></continue><para>During the election campaign the government committed to ensuring that the merger of the ABA and the ACA to form the ACMA is completed efficiently and does not disrupt the ongoing performance of the key regulatory functions of the existing regulators. The <inline ref="R2173">Australian Communications and Media Authority Bill 2004</inline> provides for the establishment of the ACMA on proclamation on 1 July 2005 or, if no proclamation has been made, by that day. Let us look at the history of this particular legislation and the need therefor. The ACMA will be responsible for regulating telecommunications, broadcasting, radio communications and online content. A combined regulator will be better placed to make coordinated responses on conversion issues. In the converging telecommunications and broadcasting environment the maintenance of two separate regulators, both dealing with similar or overlapping issues but focusing on different sectors of the communications industry, is neither practical nor effective.</para><para>New digital technologies allow previous distinct sectors to compete across increasingly convergent markets using a range of different delivery platforms. An issue such as regulating content which can be delivered on 3G mobile phones is a prime example of convergence. As the government has previously stated, it will be an administrative merger and will not be accompanied by changes to the existing regulatory spectrum and planning frameworks for telecommunications and broadcasting. The government is committed to ensuring that the merger is completed efficiently and does not disrupt the ongoing performance of the key regulatory functions of the existing regulators. The existing authorities have in place administrative arrangements to plan for the merger and are well advanced in planning for change. There will be no cost to industry as a result of the merger since there will be no change to the regulatory framework or regulatory functions. There will be no significant saving to government as a result of the merger because all of the regulatory and reporting functions of the ACMA will be the same as those which currently exist in the ACA and the ABA. Staff numbers will remain fairly constant since the new regulatory services to the public and to the industry will remain the same.</para><para>The issue that arises here is that nothing stands still and, of course, in the electronic media today we have this speed of change which is quite outstanding. On the government's initiative, we are more closely approaching the day when analog distribution of television, for instance, will cease and it will all be digital. I think people are gradually coming to terms with that. If I read the newspapers correctly, there have been quite massive sales of plasma and other state-of-the-art digital television equipment during recent times. This was a major contributor to the buoyancy of the retail sector over the Christmas period. The government looks to and welcomes the fact that Labor will support this policy but I think there are some fundamental differences with our policy. The government has indicated on numerous occasions, including during the election campaign, that there will be no immediate savings from this initiative. This is because all regulatory functions will be much the same. Labor has said on several occasions that this merger would result in savings of $70 million, presumably in an effort to fill its budgetary black hole. We say that there will be no savings because the job remains the same. Of course we are well aware that, when you have things like Medicare Gold, there are many other responsibilities that the government has to the community in this regard that were brushed aside to find money. </para><para>I am supportive of a role for government as a regulator. I think that is a significant responsibility of government, be it in competition or in what our media present to us. I think people expect that of us. I am less inclined to government being a physical provider of many services. I have never been able to work out, in the instance of having a private sector as a service provider in education and health, why government also need to be a physical provider of those services. I think we kid ourselves that we do it better and that, in fact, we would do much better to make sure that the money was available to guarantee equity of access and things of that nature, which can be done without setting ourselves up as a major manager in these areas of service. When it comes to the media, to competition policy and to standards and the quality of things that people eat and buy, I see a role for government. I think government is there to ensure fairness and quality, and all the other things that people expect and have to have confidence in government to deliver. So this new body will quite sensibly cover both of those arrangements, and I think that is important.</para><para>I also think that we have some great challenges as a parliament in looking at how the communications system will operate. I for one have been quite saddened by the loss of the individualisation of electronic media that existed when I first became the member for O'Connor. We had a television station in Geraldton, one in Albany and other services dotted around. Then of course we had progress and it all became GWN, a satellite distributor that covers all of rural Western Australia, and in a later period we got WIN television. They provide good services but they are barely localised. I have always wondered why in my electorate, the Kalgoorlie electorate in particular, and I guess the Forrest electorate—the big rural electorates surrounding Perth—when a third licence was considered we could not have had the opportunity of going back to a series of smaller services that were distinctly local. That is, local services which did not give us <inline font-style="italic">Neighbours</inline> and all that soap opera stuff. What is the latest—`Dissatisfied Wives'?

They would still of course have the opportunity to watch `Dissatisfied Wives' or <inline font-style="italic">The X Factor</inline> or, if you really want to get down to the lowest of things, <inline font-style="italic">Big Brother</inline> or something like that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>These are the things that government looks at from time to time as a regulator. We certainly have changed our attitudes over the years, and today we approve things on television that one would not have dreamed of years ago. I am open-minded about that, but there is always going to be a time when we expect of the media that they deliver a product to a standard that is acceptable to the Australian people. Therefore, I am totally supportive of this particular proposal. There is huge growth in radio and new entrants are coming on in the immediate future, and there will be a great battle for advertising revenue.</para><para>We are yet to see how the cabinet will eventually approach the idea of more deregulation throughout the entire media, between print and electronic media. That is an interesting challenge and, again, I think it is appropriate. I am not sure that it is going to change much. We worry a bit about media domination, but I have yet to see any huge influence by media proprietors on their journalists. They seem to be able to run things much as they wish. I think that that professor missed out, as quoted by the minister for education this morning, in complaining about school teachers not doing enough. I thought maybe they should educate a few journalists to have a broader view of how politics operate in Australia. But I do not think that pressure comes from media owners. Of course in this day and age a lot of the ownership is with the fund managers and, as a consequence, the role of government is to see that reasonable standards are maintained in terms of the quality of the product, not the opinions of the journalists who work there. Having made those points and having taken the opportunity to describe to the parliament again what the purpose of this legislation is, I will conclude my remarks. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>140</page.no><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name><name.id>YU5</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition support the merger of the ACA and the ABA into a single body and did so prior to the election, so we broadly support the legislation before the House. It reflects a pattern that is occurring in other parts of the world—for example, the creation of Ofcom in the United Kingdom as a single regulator spanning an even broader remit, including telecommunications and various other things that are not necessarily going to be within the ACMA remit. It certainly spans the bulk of what is going to be within the ACMA remit as part of the legislation that is before the House.</para></talk.start><para>There is an underlying issue I wish to address that I think has caused some concern in sections of the broadcasting industry and which will ultimately have to be addressed. It has been put to one side as a result of this legislation being put to the House, but nonetheless it is something that we have to think about for the future—that is, the open contestability of spectrum. At the moment we operate spectrum in this country on the basis that particular sections of spectrum are set aside for certain purposes, in this case for radio and television broadcasting. So, in effect, that spectrum is quarantined from broader market forces, and the prospect of other players—such as people in telecommunications, mobile telephony and wireless internet—being able to potentially outbid broadcasters for that spectrum does not arise.</para><para>The resistance to the merger of the ABA and the ACA that has been in the industry for some considerable time was ultimately sourced in this concern—that, by merging the regulators, you would end up with an effective merger of the way that spectrum is dealt with and ultimately an open market for spectrum use. Broadly, I have some sympathy with that view, but I think it will be some time before our society is ready for that—indeed, some time before the various sectors are ready for that. I believe that we should continue to support the notion of a separate role for broadcasting in our society—and, in particular, for radio and television broadcasting as we have known them—and I believe that spectrum should continue to be set aside for those purposes.</para><para>It is extremely important that all Australians be able to continue to have access to services that are delivered to them for free, effectively—although they pay indirectly through advertising—through radio and television. It is very important that we continue to guarantee that those services will be able to be provided and that we ensure that those industries can grow and diversify, that there is more competition and there are more services and different products. Ultimately there will be genuine convergence and what we today know as television, in particular, will cease to exist in the form that we currently know it because of technological change. But that is much overhyped and will be some distance away. For the foreseeable future, we as a society need to maintain a separate regulatory arrangement for broadcasting to ensure that spectrum will be there. </para><para>It is important that we have a genuinely expert nonpolitical regulator. One of the things that I would urge upon the government, once this legislation is passed and once the boss of the new organisation is appointed, is that we do not see any more David Flints—that we do not see any more political stooges who are there to run their own political agendas—and that we do not have an organisation that is unduly soft in the application of its regulatory and administrative roles. We need an organisation that will clamp down on miscreants and actually enforce the rules. In some respects, I felt that the former Australian Communications Authority was a bit soft in its administration of consumer protection provisions in telecommunications, for example. There are a number of lessons that we can learn from what has occurred in the recent past to ensure that the new authority has integrity, strength and impartiality and that it is genuinely an expert based authority making decisions in accordance with the legislation and the wishes of the parliament, on the basis of the merits of the issues and not on the basis of political bias—as was the case with Professor Flint—or on the basis of any other extraneous matters.</para><para>This legislation does point to the early stages of a wave of quite revolutionary change that is going to hit broadcasting in this country, and we are seeing only the very early stages of it. The transition to digital has been painfully slow in this country. It is really not gathering serious momentum and there are some major new decisions that the government will have to face up to at some point. There are questions about whether there should be further competition in television broadcasting and whether multichannelling should be allowed. There are questions about whether we should allow, in what is supposedly a high-tech industry, the kind of competition and open entry to the marketplace that is now taken for granted in virtually all other industries or whether we should continue to stick with an antiquated regulatory framework that reflects a bygone world.</para><para>If you think about it, we have seen very little change in television for 25 years. The last major change in Australian television, in true impact, was the entry of SBS—and I acknowledge the presence in the parliament today of the member for Kooyong, who had a significant role in the creation of SBS. That was the last major development in Australian television—25 years ago or thereabouts. It is a sector that has not changed very much since that time, yet the technology has changed enormously and is going to change even further. I believe that, unless the technological change wave that is starting to gather momentum is adapted to by television as we know it, it will ultimately disappear. There are really major challenges emerging for the broadcasting sector—for radio as well as television—and, yes, they are entitled to a continued place in the broadcasting spectrum. They are entitled to a continuing role in our society, but they are not entitled to undue protection from competition or from the implications of technological change.</para><para>So whether it is the transition to digital in radio, the prospect of satellite radio, the question of additional licences in television or the question of multichannelling, there is no question about where I stand on these issues: I am in favour of reform, I am in favour of progress, I am in favour of allowing technological change and market forces to give better products, more choice, more diversity and more jobs for Australian consumers and for Australian society. There are some difficult micro issues to be dealt with, but it is about time the government started to front up to those issues instead of ducking and weaving, which it has done for a number of years. It is about time the government started to front up to those issues and to institute a serious reform agenda in Australian broadcasting. </para><para>There are lots of things that we could do. There is significant change occurring in other jurisdictions. If you look at what is happening with digital television in Britain, for example, you will see the impact of pursuing a progressive mechanism for introducing digital TV there, whereas it has been a dismal failure thus far in Australia, in spite of all the hype that has been put forward. We have got to take these issues and move with them and move with technological change and allow the broadcasting sector to flourish, to genuinely innovate and to build on and improve what it delivers for Australia. Some of that has happened in radio. More competition has led to more activity, more jobs, more revenue and much greater diversity of product for Australian consumers—and much more choice in radio. I believe that we need to follow that pattern in television as well and then we will have a better sector and a better society.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>142</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Frank was born Francis Clive Churchill in September 1931 in Melbourne. He grew up in Port Melbourne and attended the Albert Park Primary School and South Melbourne Technical College, before undertaking a butcher's apprenticeship. Frank was married at 19 to Ellen and, to quote Frank, he has `completed 54 years' of marriage, no doubt a significant achievement in itself. Ellen and Frank had five children, one of whom is now deceased, and they are now the proud grandparents of 13 grandchildren and three great grandchildren. I have met one of Frank's grandchildren, Steven—who is studying the VCE at Gladstone Park Secondary College. Steven Churchill is a fabulous young man with a brilliant mind, and I have no doubt that he will go on one day to achieve great things.</para></talk.start><para>Frank Churchill moved to Broadmeadows in 1957 and has continued to reside there since, educating all of his children in Broadmeadows. Typical of members of the local community, Frank is a proud Broadmeadows resident. Frank has been a member of Freemasonry Victoria for the past 40 years and during his career he has worked as a butcher, milkman, painter and docker, truck driver and firefighter.</para><para>In 1956, Frank joined the Metropolitan Fire Brigade. He retired after 32 years in 1988. During his time at the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, Frank was an active life member of the United Firefighters Union, for whom he served as a shop steward. He was a member of the committee of management before becoming president and then being elected as secretary. In 1975 Frank was appointed commissioner on the inaugural occupational health and safety commission, representing the Victorian Trades Hall Council. Along with other commissioners, he received a WorkSafe Victoria Award in 2004, in recognition of this work.</para><para>Also in 1975, Frank became the foundation director of the Firefighters Credit Union and was an active participant on the credit union's steering committee. Frank completed 27 years continuous service as director and was elected in October 2004 for a further three-year term. He was made an Associate Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Credit Union Directors in 2004. In addition to these positions, Frank became a director in 2001 on the inaugural board of Northern Support Services—formerly the Helping Hand Association for people with disabilities—a position he still holds today. </para><para>In December 1982, as a senior fireman, Frank was honoured with the National Medal for diligent long service to the community in hazardous circumstances, including in times of emergency and national disaster in direct protection of life and property. On Australia Day this year, Frank was honoured with the Medal of the Order of Australia for services to the community, through support for social welfare organisations for people with disabilities, particularly through the Northern Support Services group, and for services to the emergency services, through the United Firefighters Union and the Firefighters Credit Union. A search of the Australian honours list shows that Frank is only the second person from Broadmeadows to receive such an honour, the only other being Stephen Collins in 1984. We in Broadmeadows are very proud of Frank Churchill for that achievement.</para><para>I attended the Australia Day presentation ceremony at the Broadmeadows Town Hall and it was an absolute delight to see such a deserving recipient awarded the honour of the Medal of the Order of Australia. At the congratulatory luncheon held the following Sunday and attended by a great number of Frank's friends and well wishers, I extended my personal congratulations to Frank and presented him with a certificate of congratulations. Tonight, I would like to formally record my congratulations to Frank Churchill OAM, a proud Broadmeadows resident whose achievements are to be commended. I congratulate Frank for his many achievements and I particularly congratulate him for being honoured this year with the Order of Australia medal. Frank, you are a very deserving recipient, and I am proud to be your representative in the federal parliament.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Mr Andy Hall</title><page.no>143</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>143</page.no><name role="metadata">Georgiou, Petro, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GEORGIOU</name><name.id>HM5</name.id><electorate>Kooyong</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This House is extremely well served by members of the House of Representatives staff—by their advice, by their assistance and, more than occasionally, by their simple human kindness. Sometimes our colleagues are unkind to us and the staff actually fill the gap. I think this observation is true of all House of Representatives staff, from the people who say hello in the morning to the people who give us glasses of water—for some obscure reason we seem to be incapable of getting them ourselves. Tonight I would like to pay tribute to Andy Hall. Andy has notified the Department of the House of Representatives of his intention to resign as an employee, effective from the middle of this month.</para></talk.start><para>Of all the jobs in the parliament, looking after members of parliament across the range of their equipment, printing and IT needs—not least of which is the dreaded hand-held computer—must be a bit like undertaking the labours of Hercules. The task is usually enhanced by the astonishingly good manners of members of the House of Representatives—not least when they are under pressure or computers go down. To do the job with grace, patience and concern you need the qualities possessed by Andy Hall. No wonder Andy's hair has gone prematurely white.</para><para>As a member of parliament, I have known Andy Hall for a decade. He has been the epitome of two things: firstly, can-do professionalism and responsiveness, and, secondly—and this is worth underscoring—a gentlemanly kindness. Andy has always bent over backwards to discharge the substance of responsibilities rather than merely the form of them, and I think most of us have benefited when he has tried to help us make things work—rather than just saying that it cannot be done. </para><para>Andy commenced work with the department in August 1986 as a sessional attendant. In September 1987 he moved into the transport office and then to the stationery store in 1988. In 1991 Andy was promoted to the position of printing manager—and I think some of us have had first-hand experience of his enormous capacity to get things done against astonishingly tight deadlines, often imposed upon him by unreasonable members of parliament. Since 2000 Andy has been involved in the support of IT equipment. I am not sure that that exactly made his day, but he was astonishingly good at it. Andy received an Australia Day medal in 1993 and was also awarded a medal for his contribution to the Australian Public Service on its centenary in June 2001. I still remember that ceremony.</para><para>Andy exemplifies the qualities that are found in all recipients of the Australia Day medallion, especially those relating to advancing the quality and the perceptions of House of Representatives services and caring for the welfare of his colleagues. The type of work he has been doing so energetically in respect of member services in a number of fields and his activities above and beyond the call of duty have made him a very important part of the lives of members and friends. On behalf of all members, I would like to wish him and his wife Pam all the best in the next phase of their lives—I hope it is the best phase of their lives too—and to thank him genuinely for all the assistance he has given to members.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Walter Construction Group</title><page.no>144</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>144</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Australian building workers and small businesses are being forced to grapple with yet another corporate collapse—that of the Walter Construction Group. The administrators have described the group as `hopelessly insolvent'. They have warned retrenched employees that there is little prospect of receiving their full entitlements as a result of this collapse. How could such a major construction company be `hopelessly insolvent' during a sustained building boom? Didn't anyone in authority see the collapse coming? And does anyone in authority really care?</para></talk.start><para>The Walter Group owes $18 million to permanent employees. Since the group's realisable assets are valued at between $17 million and $26 million and it has only $10 million in liquid assets, and since it also owes creditors $90 million, the employees look like ending up high and dry. The government promised years ago that it would legislate to rank employees above creditors but has never fulfilled that promise. So the employees will be left to the mercy of the government's General Employee Entitlement Scheme, otherwise known as GEERS. If you believed the former Minister for Small Business and Tourism, the employees would get 100 per cent of their entitlements through GEERS. During the election campaign, where truth seems to be an early casualty, in an interview on Radio 2UE's Steve Price program on 30 August the following exchange occurred. Minister Hockey said:</para><quote><para>Well, we already have a fund that covers employee entitlements and we do that, we have that fund because we've done the hard yards on managing our budget and we have the funds available so that we do not have to increase taxes.</para></quote><para>The member for Sydney, Ms Plibersek, asked: </para><quote><para>Do they get a hundred per cent of their entitlements, Joe?</para></quote><para>Mr Hockey replied:</para><quote><para>Yes, they do. Yes, they do.</para></quote><para>That is what the minister for small business at the time said—that, under GEERS, employees receive 100 per cent of their entitlements. The fact is that GEERS does not pay 100 per cent of employee entitlements. GEERS is capped at eight weeks redundancy pay and does not cover any unpaid superannuation. These limits are publicised on the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations website—www.workplace.gov.au—on the employee entitlements webpage.</para><para>Documents obtained through freedom of information reveal that these limits on GEERS and other limits have left working Australians more than $35.3 million out of pocket. The FOI documents reveal that the Howard government is pretending to protect employee entitlements but is short-changing one in five claimants—that is, almost 4,000 working Australians—by an average of $9,000 each. So you have the minister for small business at the time saying that 100 per cent of employee entitlements are paid, yet the FOI documents reveal the truth—that almost 4,000 working Australians have been short-changed by an average of $9,000 each.</para><para>The only employees who have received 100 per cent protection of their entitlements are those of the Prime Minister's brother Stan. As a result of that scandal, Labor and the general community were able to shame this government into introducing a limited employee entitlements scheme known as GEERS. In contrast, Labor took to the election a proposal to cover 100 per cent of employee entitlements, including superannuation, and it was that scheme that the former minister for small business was criticising in that 2UE radio interview on that day. That is why he was on radio: because he was criticising Labor's proposal to protect 100 per cent of employee entitlements while pretending that the government's own scheme did just that, and of course it does not.</para><para>The government claims it is the party of small business and it wants to protect contractors. It has foreshadowed legislation about that. But what about the subcontractors to the Walker Group working on its 30-odd projects? They will take a big hit, but of course they will try to stay solvent. They will not be entitled to GEERS, since they are not the employees of an insolvent company. Who is going to look after the subbies? Not the Howard government, which pays lip-service to protecting contractors. Here is an opportunity for the government to put its money where its mouth is, to take an active interest in the plight of both employees and subcontractors. It is expected that at least 500 employees will be retrenched on Friday. I call on the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to involve himself personally and not wait for the gears of GEERS to grind slowly forward, eventually paying part of the entitlements owed. If the government were interested in anything but pre-election political rhetoric, it would involve itself in this unfolding disaster.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Nuclear Science Technology Organisation</title><page.no>145</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>145</page.no><name role="metadata">Vale, Danna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs VALE</name><name.id>VK6</name.id><electorate>Hughes</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I would like to increase awareness in this House of the new and forthcoming capabilities of the Australian Nuclear Science Technology Organisation, ANSTO, our country's nuclear research and development organisation and the centre of Australian nuclear expertise, which I am very proud to say is located in my electorate of Hughes. In a recent announcement in my electorate, the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, named ANSTO's replacement research reactor `OPAL', which stands for Open Pool Australian Light-water reactor. OPAL is a name designed to give this $330 million scientific investment a recognisably Australian name. I would also like to acknowledge the students in my electorate from St John Bosco College who helped with suggestions that influenced the new name. </para></talk.start><para>The minister also launched the new state-of-the-art $3.2 million Small Tandem for Applied Research particle accelerator, otherwise known as STAR. STAR offers Australian researchers, particularly universities, world-class ion beam and accelerator mass spectrometry capabilities to conduct studies into the environment, archaeology, heritage, biology and materials. STAR will also be able to do important work such as carbon dating and forensic analysis. It will help to accommodate increasing scientific demands and also encourage innovative Australian research in fields where this was previously problematic.</para><para>Of even more significance is OPAL. The new reactor will be a world-class neutron source capable of supporting up to 17 neutron beam instruments. The first eight of these instruments are currently under construction. The scope of research that these instruments will allow is tremendous, from research on advanced materials through to molecular biology and using technologies that were unknown at the time the first reactor was built.</para><para>As well as opening up new areas of research, ANSTO is well known as the principal producer and supplier of radioisotopes for medical diagnosis, treatment and pain relief in Australia. Last year approximately 550,000 patient treatments were transported from ANSTO to hospitals all around Australia, and increasingly in South-East Asia as well. Nuclear medicines are chiefly used for diagnosis, but increasingly also to treat disease and for pain relief. For example, bone scans can detect the spread of cancers six to 18 months sooner than X-rays can.</para><para>With the replacement research reactor, ANSTO will have sufficient flux to be able to produce not just diagnostic nuclear medicines but a great range of therapeutic medicines as well. We can go on to actually treat cancers and tumours by injections with nuclear medicine. ANSTO also conducts new research aimed at developing new radiation treatments for different types of cancer and other medical conditions. Of course, ANSTO's expertise in these fields will increase as the replacement research reactor comes on line.</para><para>With additional capacity, ANSTO will also be able to expand its support for the Australian manufacturing, minerals and agricultural industries. The estimated gross benefit of support for the minerals industry, for example, currently exceeds $100 million annually. The replacement reactor will give us significantly more. This modern facility will attract eminent foreign scientists to work in Australia and provide Australian scientists with greater reciprocal access to complementary first-class research facilities around the world. As people can see, the return to Australia from this reactor will indeed be significant.</para><para>In terms of general everyday uses of radioactivity, examples include radioactive materials that are used to test the quality of steel in automobiles; aircraft manufacturers using radiation to check for flaws in jet engines; and mining and petroleum companies using radionuclides to locate and quantify mineral deposits. Manufacturers use radioactive materials to obtain the proper thickness of tin and aluminium; pipeline companies use radioactive materials to look for defects in welds; and oil, gas and mining companies use radioactive materials to map geological contours, using test wells and mine bores, and to determine the presence of hydrocarbons. By showing how plants absorb fertiliser, radioactive materials help researchers to learn when fertiliser should be applied and how much is needed. This helps prevent the overuse of fertiliser as a major source of soil and water pollution. Radioactivity is also used in sterilisation techniques to control insect pests such as fruit flies, which is very important in agricultural Australia. Smoke detectors rely on a tiny source of radioactivity source to sound the alarm when they sense smoke from a fire. Irradiation of silicon for the semiconductor industry is significant business for ANSTO. Cosmetics, hair products and contact lens solutions are sterilised with radiation to remove irritants and allergens. And this is to name just a few applications. </para><para>This marks the beginning of a new phase in Australian science. I can proudly say that, in my electorate, this reactor is really an Aussie gem. I will be speaking to the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads regarding a pressing need for a serious upgrading of the road used by ANSTO and its employees. This is the Illawarra road, and I have every confidence in the minister. He will address this important local issue.

Given the increasing involvement that Australia is now having with the Pacific—I would suggest far too late—under this government, it is a particularly interesting area to spend time in. Next week I will be looking for an opportunity to give a much more detailed account of the visit, the things that I learned and some of the suggestions that I would make arising from the visit. But in the very limited time I have this evening, I want to touch on two matters.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, I want to add to the contributions of others in this House by offering my condolences to the relatives and friends of Adam Dunning, the fine young Australian policeman who was murdered in quite cowardly circumstances in Honiara just before Christmas. Being in that place brings home to one the sacrifice that some people have to make to achieve the objectives that on a bipartisan basis are supported in the Australian parliament. Adam's sacrifice needs to be remembered in Australia forever.</para><para>Shortly after Adam's murder, I publicly suggested that it would be appropriate for the Australian government, in consultation with his family, to find some ongoing way of commemorating his service. I suggested that one possible way would be to endow a scholarship for a young Solomon Islander of great promise to allow him or her to be educated in Australia. I am still not aware of any decision by the government on that matter, and I look forward to a government decision.</para><para>Given the scale of Australia's commitment, and particularly given the scale of resources from our police that are now required in the Pacific, including the Solomon Islands, the morale of police is critically important. I have to say that the young Australian men and women serving in the Solomons are very fine people, and their morale is high. However, there are some matters that need attention fairly promptly in order to maintain that.</para><para>In visiting the Australian base just out of Honiara—GBR as it is called—I found that there were some problems with Australians maintaining contact with loved ones and friends back in Australia. At that base there are only four public phones available to our police personnel to call back to Australia, and there is no real privacy associated with the use of those phones. That is something that I think is going to adversely affect personnel unless it is addressed very quickly. There are over 100 police—not just Australians, but Australians are probably the largest contingent—at that location, and they are expected to maintain contact with loved ones back in their homeland from four very public phones with, as I say, no privacy. Moreover, there are only six internet connections available for that place. </para><para>I sincerely hope that the people who are responsible for these matters will give prompt attention to upgrading the capacity of young Australians and young Pacific Islanders who are serving together, to maintain connections. They need to do that in order to continue the support that they get emotionally and otherwise from friends and relatives in Australia. I will have more to say about that and a couple of other matters on an occasion when I have more time.</para><para>The other matter I want to briefly comment on is the pride I had in being an Australian present when the Australian under-20 soccer team won the Oceania championship in Honiara last Monday week. It defeated the Solomon Islands 3-0. However, the Solomon Islands were not shamed. They did extraordinarily well to get into the finals. They defeated New Zealand, Fiji and Vanuatu to get there and they played very well.</para><para>Unfortunately, the occasion was marred by some rowdy and bad behaviour by some people in the vicinity of the match. I gather there was some doubt about whether the international soccer authorities would agree to allow the Socceroos to play in the Solomon Islands later this year for qualification for the World Cup—the Oceania qualification. I understand that the soccer authorities have now, with conditions, agreed to allow Honiara to be used for that important event later in the year, and that is a very positive development for soccer and for the Solomon Islands.

Over the months prior to the Christmas and New Year break I received hundreds of emails, faxes and phone calls about problems associated with the pressure placed on payers of support following broken marriages. As a result of all of those particular faxes, emails and calls, I am very much aware of the failure of successive governments and ministers of the Crown to detect and rectify the anti male culture endemic in the Child Support Agency.</para></talk.start><para>More importantly, since then I have been getting additional faxes, emails and phone calls to the point where I now have three files containing hundreds and hundreds of cases of what can only be described as the disgraceful results of actions by the Child Support Agency. I believe that in most cases it is abusing its powers and is misusing the act under which it operates. The information that I have proves conclusively that the actions of the Child Support Agency have had a significant impact on male suicide. It has certainly had an impact on bankruptcies. It has caused breakdown, heartache and pressures for new families where payers of support have tried to get on with their life and create new relationships. It has pursued the illegal and abusive use of its powers by accessing people's bank accounts, which I have referred to in the past. </para><para>These stories, from people from all over Australia, have reinforced and confirmed to me that the thing I feared is in fact operating. Institutionalised sexism is endemic and operating in the Child Support Agency and, to a lesser degree, in the Family Court. I have been so concerned about this particular issue that I have had preliminary talks with the commissioner who deals, within and outside the government, with issues of sex discrimination. I have asked the commissioner to sit down and give me an overall brief on what her role is, how her charter operates and how she, as the commissioner, is required to operate it. I did that on the basis of forewarning her that I am going to lodge an official complaint, as a member of parliament, about the anti male bias in the way the Child Support Agency operates and its obviously institutionalised sexism against males.</para><para>I will do that because I can no longer tolerate and bear to read about and absorb the pain and suffering that is occurring because of the way in which they operate. Publicly, they declare that their task is to provide child support but it is, in fact, spousal maintenance, which is destroying lives and careers. I can no longer allow that to happen and I am going to pursue this issue. If it takes this and the next term of government to get a final conclusion—such as the Child Support Agency being restructured or removed and replaced with some other form of child support that lives and operates within the realm of reasonableness in the Australian community—then that is the way it is going to have to be. Unfortunately, that may not go down too well with some of my parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the House, and it certainly may not go down too well with some of the ministers of the Crown in this place. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ministerial Reply</title><page.no>149</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>149</page.no><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LLOYD</name><name.id>IK6</name.id><electorate>Robertson</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I note comments by the member for Hughes earlier in the debate and I want to make a statement to the House in reply. Earlier today, I gave an undertaking to the House to make some inquiries on particular matters relating to the Tumbi Creek Regional Partnerships funding. I am advised of the following. On 9 June 2004, the Wyong council in New South Wales voted to adopt on-land disposal of dredge spoil from Tumbi Creek. The dredging and associated works were required to prevent potential flooding of nearby houses on Tumbi Creek, and to prevent some 15,000 cubic metres of silt from Tumbi Creek being deposited on the floor of the Tuggerah Lake system. This problem had been the subject of correspondence between Wyong Shire Council and the New South Wales government as far back as December 2003, and between the member for Dobell, Mr Ken Ticehurst, and the NSW and Australian governments. There were proposals for assistance from both governments in resolving this issue.</para></talk.start><para>Wyong council's June 2004 proposal was predicated on the state and federal governments providing matching grants—some $680,000 in addition to council's $680,000. Council's decision to propose this project was based on detailed study by its director of engineering services and after consideration and agreement by the full council. On 10 June 2004, the Department of Transport and Regional Services, DOTARS, received an application from Wyong council. The department commenced assessment of that Regional Partnerships application. On 23 June 2004, the department provided briefing to the then parliamentary secretary, the Hon.

The grant was announced by the member for Dobell on 1 July 2004. It will be recalled that Wyong council's application was predicated on matching funds from both the federal and state governments. When it became clear that the New South Wales government would not provide matching funding, Wyong council gave further consideration to the issue. On 1 July 2004 Wyong council lodged a revised application seeking an additional $680,000 from Regional Partnerships. On 11 July 2004 the then parliamentary secretary approved the additional funding request because the project was regarded as sufficiently important to justify the additional funding. On 26 August 2004 details of the total grant were announced.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There was considerable rain in October 2004 and subsequent media reports, such as the <inline font-style="italic">Central Coast Advocate </inline>of 12 November 2004, reported that the rain had `flushed' the silt blocking the mouth of Tumbi Creek. This led to some local speculation, including by a councillor, that funds might be used for other projects. On 17 November 2004 Mr Hallett of my office sought advice from my department on the implications of the flushing of the creek. The department's advice was that:</para><quote><para>The two projects agreed by Mrs Kelly regarding Tumbi Creek are yet to be contracted and will be impacted upon by the recent removal of the blockage at the mouth of Tumbi Creek.

Wyong council has provided a verbatim transcript of the advice tendered by the Director of Engineering Services, Mr David Cathers. This advice was tendered at the ordinary meeting of council and would have been easily obtained by the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues before they made the false allegations raised in the House earlier today. Any of the three Labor representatives on the Wyong council could have provided it. The substance of his report was that, while approximately 1,000 cubic metres of soil had been disposed of by the recent rains, they were dealing with a situation in which 15,000 cubic metres needed to be dealt with. The Director of Engineering Services concluded:</para><quote><para>In terms of raising the issue about `is there any need to do any further work?' It is a very valid question and it is indeed worthwhile identifying and that is what we've done but further work does need doing. </para></quote><para>I table that report from the Director of Engineering Services from Wyong council. At all times this matter has been dealt with properly. To date no money has been paid. Funds cannot be used for purposes other than those approved, and any funds that are not required will be retained by the Commonwealth. I am advised that contracts are yet to be signed and can assure the House that funds will only be provided for a proper purpose. The claim that there has been a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth of funds is ridiculous and the Leader of the Opposition should immediately apologise to all those people he so lightly slandered earlier today.

The first is Jean Kent. Jean wrote to me in November last year to let me know that she had been awarded a grant of $20,000 by the Literature Board of the Australia Council for the Arts to work on her fifth collection of poetry. She has a book in the making which has a working title of `Mangoes and Madeleines'. She says this `will explore and celebrate places where a variety of contemporary Australians feel at home'. She has lived and worked in Lake Macquarie and the Hunter Valley since 1983 and says `you can be sure that these places will have starring roles!' Jean writes:</para></talk.start><quote><para>This grant will be invaluable for my writing of the poems. Making any sort of living from literary writing is very difficult and funding from the Australia Council provides both an acknowledgement that this is valued work <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> time to concentrate on that work, without the distractions and stresses of other employment. I am very grateful for the support of literature through this program.</para></quote><para>Jean grew up in Queensland. She began publishing poetry in 1971 and, as she said, she has lived in Lake Macquarie since 1983 and is currently a lecturer in creative writing at the University of Newcastle. The subject of this new collection of poems, as I said, will range from Lake Macquarie and the Hunter Valley to Paris and Lithuania in order to explore and celebrate places where a variety of contemporary Australians feel at home. I pay tribute to Jean Kent.</para><para>The other creative young person in my electorate that I would like to speak about is Nikki Wilson-Smith. Nikki arrived in Canberra on the weekend along with another 36 young Australians for the Heywire Youth Issues Forum. This forum enables 16- to 22-year-olds to discuss issues relevant to them with Australia's political and cultural leaders. In about 20 minutes time, I am going to have a chance to meet with Nikki Wilson-Smith. Nikki produced a radio story for our local ABC radio in Newcastle as part of the Heywire program, focusing on the issue of Sudanese refugees who have settled in Newcastle and who have recently been the subject of a disgusting racist campaign. However, she speaks of befriending Sudanese refugees and how she experienced racism herself. When in Vietnam buying guitar strings, she was kicked out of a shop because she was white. Experiencing that racial hatred has inspired this 21-year-old to embrace multiculturalism and to embrace other cultures in our community. I congratulate her for it and look forward to speaking with her. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Master Butchers Cooperative Centenary Book</title><page.no>152</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>152</page.no><name role="metadata">Draper, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DRAPER</name><name.id>0L6</name.id><electorate>Makin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On Saturday night I had the great honour and pleasure of representing the Hon.

I want to pay tribute today to one of the three authors, Rada Turner, who lives in Pooraka in my electorate of Makin. It was a great pleasure on the night to pay tribute to her work, along with that of the other two authors. </para></talk.start><para>I want to congratulate the board of directors for commissioning this book to chronicle the events in the history of the meat industry in South Australia from its beginnings in 1905. The authors have done an extraordinary job. The book was a year in production. Not only have the authors contributed to the Master Butchers Cooperative historical record, but they have made an immensely important contribution to South Australian history and the history of our great nation. From the very beginning of the book the authors take us through a delightful journey of facts, anecdotes, mateship and yarns that trace the struggles, hardships, diligence and devotion of the many and varied members of the MBL, who worked to continue the foundation of one of the most successful cooperatives to operate anywhere in the world. Of course, there are too many to be named individually, and I must leave that to others.</para><para>The journey also takes us through the battle for hides and skins, drought, World War I, the roaring twenties, the Depression years, World War II, our relationship with the Empire, the advent of the butchers picnic and the annual ball, Hyde's Patent Bar and women in the meat industry. At this point I would like to acknowledge the special tribute paid by the authors in chapter 4 to women in the meat industry. As the authors stated, there were two groups of women around which the meat industry revolved: those who were married to or were children of members and those who were not. Wives were often accorded great respect, such as in the article written by spyglass in the <inline font-style="italic">Master Butcher </inline>on 5 June 1939. He wrote:</para><quote><para>There are hundreds of present day butchers who owe all to their wives: who amongst us has not seen them wielding the chopper, wrapping up parcels, answering the telephone, chatting with customers and being forced to listen week in and week out to the same old anecdotes of what happened to some of their customers at their last operation.</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australia Post: Services</title><page.no>153</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>153</page.no><name role="metadata">Byrne, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BYRNE</name><name.id>008K0</name.id><electorate>Holt</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this morning to talk about the provision of a fairly basic service—an essential service, you would think—in a suburb called Narre Warren South, which some members may know has about 14,000 residents. It is an area full of young home owners and young families, and one that is filled with enormous community spirit. On weekends these people and families visit Strathaird Reserve and the Amberly Park Shopping Centre—a fairly innovative shopping centre that was opened in about October 2003 and has been incredibly well supported by the community. The shopping centre has a supermarket, a newsagent, a bank and financial services office and other shops. In April, it will even have a fully bulk-billing medical office, which will have about nine professional suites. It is a growing shopping centre which is actually a community hub.</para></talk.start><para>It may surprise those present to know, having provided this fulsome description of the shopping centre, that one thing it does not have is an Australia Post box. That is a rather absurd situation. This shopping centre has been open for 16 months and has roughly 25,000 people going through it per week using the facilities and the businesses. Aki Giorgio is a young small business owner who personifies Narre Warren South. He lives there, he is a battler and he has established a newsagency in Amberly Park Shopping Centre. About 200 people a day use Aki's newsagency and many of them say the same thing: `We pay our taxes. We work hard in the community. We are going to have a fully bulk-billing medical centre, but we're not going to have an Australia Post box!' </para><para>We have made numerous representations to Australia Post with respect to this issue, and they say there is postbox in the Casey Central Shopping Centre, which is roughly 2.6 kilometres away from the Amberly Park Shopping Centre.

Aki Giorgio has been lobbying for 16 months to get something as basic as one red Australia Post box. He has written letters, we have tabled petitions and he has not got it.

There are a number of groups that I would like to acknowledge in particular for their generosity.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, the Western Port Oberon Association, inspired by the work of Wendy Kelly, a woman of Sri Lankan descent, gathered together enormous amounts of food, clothing and other items as well as some funding to assist victims of the tsunami in Sri Lanka. They gave many hours of their time. Led by Wendy, they put in an enormous effort and have dispatched a huge quantity of desperately needed materials to the people of Sri Lanka. So I very specifically want to say to Wendy Kelly and to the Western Port Oberon Association, led by Max Bryant: thank you for the generosity and the time you have given. It is a wonderful demonstration of common humanity, compassion and the generosity which is always within the community.</para><para>The second group I want to acknowledge is the Rotary Club of Phillip Island. The Rotary Club on Phillip Island put together what you might call a coin table, where people were encouraged to put down a gold coin. Through that process, where the table was in the main shopping centre of Cowes on Phillip Island, they filled the table four times. Each table had approximately $8,000 worth of coins on it, so through that one simple process of coin donations they raised $32,000 over a couple of weeks. It was an extraordinarily simple but effective process. Similarly, both Rotary and Lions in Westernport and Hastings raised a significant amount of funds and also materiel for tsunami victims throughout the Indian Ocean region. They are tremendous groups with tremendous volunteers who made a wonderfully important contribution.</para><para>Finally, the Clean Ocean Foundation, rather than raising funds for itself, used a public rally about the Gunnamatta outfall to raise funds for people in coastal villages who had hosted and taken care of surfers—because there is a common link—and they did a tremendous job in so doing. I want to thank not just these groups but also all the groups and individuals throughout the electorate of Flinders who have given generously and without hesitation.

I will make some specific comments about the situation in Sri Lanka; however, I will begin in general terms. No-one could remain untouched by the tremendous devastation from the tsunami in a number of countries, particularly Indonesia but also Sri Lanka, India and Thailand, and in many other countries to a much smaller extent—though, nonetheless, for those communities there is still a sense of real devastation from what has occurred. People cannot fail to be touched by the work of the international community and of ordinary people throughout the world, particularly here in Australia. Australians have opened up their hearts and their pockets to provide support.</para></talk.start><para>I think it is also very proper to acknowledge that the efforts of the Australian government on behalf of the Australian community have been more than significant and are certainly to be commended as a real commitment to providing the necessary assistance to communities. It sets a benchmark for the future for dealing with international disasters, and I urge the government to maintain that sort of commitment to these sorts of problems. Hopefully, we will not face something of this nature again, but history tells us that we will.</para><para>Having made those points and commended the activities that the government has undertaken, particularly in relation to Indonesia, I would like to say a little about the situation in Sri Lanka. Many members, including the previous speaker, the member for Flinders, have expatriates of the Sri Lankan community living in their electorates. I certainly have a large expatriate Sri Lankan community in my electorate. It is a very diverse community. We often use that word `diverse' in this chamber, but in the context of the Sri Lankan community it most certainly is diverse. It has been defined to an extent by the civil war that has been going on in Sri Lanka for many years. Significant communities of Sinhalese, Tamils, Burghers and Muslims are all part of what makes up modern Sri Lanka.</para><para>In the context of what has occurred there in recent times, we are seeing a very desperate situation. It is a country with a population that is just under the population of Australia's, yet we are talking about over 31,000 people who have died. We are talking about nearly 80,000 families who have been displaced, and over half a million people have been involved in that. We are talking about over 320 camps that have been set up to deal with the issues being faced there. Certainly, there are problems that need to be dealt with by the Sri Lankan government and there are concerns that have to be dealt with by the community. I support all efforts that can be done to assist in Sri Lanka. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>South Australia: Bushfires</title><page.no>155</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>155</page.no><name role="metadata">Richardson, Kym, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RICHARDSON</name><name.id>E0B</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I rise to speak about an issue which is close to my heart—the tireless and ongoing work of emergency service personnel in a crisis.

South Australian volunteers placed their lives on the line on 11 January 2005, and they did so not to protect their own livelihoods or loved ones but to protect the lives and property of friends, neighbours and in some cases strangers for the one simple reason that these people needed their help. That help has continued beyond the battle to put out the fire and it will continue long after the clean-up is finished.</para><para>Aid organisations and a whole new band of volunteers have gone into the area to help those left to rebuild their lives. South Australians have again dug deep and donated anything they can spare to help in the rebuilding process. I stand before you today as a very proud South Australian, reflecting and acknowledging the people around us in times of tragedy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Past policies and programs constrain new departures and the inertia inherent in defending existing commitments is always a brake on progress. Nonetheless, an important test of a government's vitality is its ability to keep innovating.</para></talk.start><para>The Governor-General's speech and the policy substance of the election campaign demonstrate that the coalition is meeting this challenge across a wide band of areas. The foundation of this ability has been the strength of the Australian economy that has resulted from the coalition's stewardship. The Australian economy has been made into one of the world's strongest. The results of the economic reforms over the period of the Howard government are manifest: increased productivity and economic growth at a long-term average of 3.5 per cent per annum; the increase in the wealth and incomes of the Australian people; the fall in unemployment from 11 per cent to 5.1 per cent, the lowest level of unemployment since 1976; and inflation and interest rates have been kept low. This economic performance, produced by effective management, has given the government the capacity to innovate in positive and constructive ways in many areas. </para><para>When I was young I was struck by an academic paper with the title `Necessity is the mother of invention, or the devil makes work for idle hands: two theories of innovation'. In more prosaic terms the question posed was whether innovation was dictated by scarcity or liberated by plenty. As is usually the case with academic propositions, neither is entirely true. There is, to steal a phrase, a `third way'. Innovation is driven by both need and by opportunity. Under the Howard government effective economic management has meant that innovation to meet real needs has taken place amongst favourable settings. Scarcity ultimately cannot be banished; choices do have to be made between different needs. Overwhelmingly however, the coalition has been able to meet needs by creating a positive sum game. I want to exemplify this proposition by looking at two of the areas covered in the Governor-General's speech—Medicare and school education.</para><para>I take Medicare first. As I have said before, there is not much point in pretending that the coalition has always been wholeheartedly committed to Medicare or its precursor, Medibank. That is simply not the case. Many of us recollect, and some of us participated in, the constant change to Medibank under the Fraser government. During our opposition years promises were constantly made to fundamentally change the basic components of Medicare. This changed in the aftermath of Fightback when John Howard as Leader of the Opposition gave an unequivocal commitment that the coalition would fully retain the Medicare system. That commitment has been honoured and exceeded. Governments are never free of blemishes but I think it is a great tribute to the coalition that we eventually recognised one of the major Whitlam reforms and embraced it. The reality is that one of the Howard government's great success stories has been strengthening Medicare. It is the coalition government that has ensured the viability of Medicare.</para><para>The government has ensured that all Australians have improved access to affordable medical services. The centrepiece of the government's new Strengthening Medicare package is the safety net. This protects individuals and families often coping with chronic illness or injury who confront significant out-of-pocket medical costs. In my electorate of Kooyong alone some 6,500 people benefited from the safety net in the first three months of its operation.</para><para>The government has also moved to underpin and expand the rate of bulk-billing in Australia. It did so prior to the election and during the campaign when it announced the introduction of the 100 per cent Medicare measure. From 1 January 2005 the Medicare benefits schedule now pays 100 per cent rebate on scheduled fees for unreferred GP visits. The high level of reimbursement applies to all unreferred GP visits not just bulk-billed consultations, as Labor proposed. The national bulk-billing rate has risen by 5.3 percentage points, or eight per cent in relative terms, since the Strengthening Medicare package was announced. The national bulk-billing rate for Australians aged 65 or older is even higher. In that age category 82.1 per cent of all medical consultations are now bulk-billed. </para><para>The question of philosophy lies at the heart of any debate about health policy, and I am afraid that I have to say that Labor has a very blinkered view about health and, in particular, the role of the private sector in delivering what is a quality health care system by any international standard. Fortunately, the government has come to understand that a public and private sector mix and balance is essential to the delivery of quality health and education services in this country. Lifetime Health Cover and a 30 per cent private health insurance rebate have relieved pressure on public hospitals and improved access for people who do not have private health insurance. It has enhanced the likelihood of early and appropriate hospitalisation whenever and wherever it is required. The interests of all Australians are best served when we have viable, efficient and successful private, as well as public, hospitals.</para><para>There must be a commitment to support those Australians who make the sacrifice to take out and maintain private health insurance, and optimise their treatment options. The government's 30 per cent private health insurance rebate does support these Australians and, during the course of the election campaign, the government announced a plan to increase that rebate to 35 per cent for Australians aged 65 and 40 per cent for Australians aged 70 years or older. I look forward to that change coming into operation in April following the passage of the enabling legislation, which is scheduled for debate today.</para><para>Finally, I am pleased that this government has directed attention, planning and resources to some of the unsung areas of need in our community—to the problems of mental health and dementia. The government will invest $110 million in mental health and ensure that Australians with mental health problems receive effective care. This government can be rightly proud of its achievements across a broad spectrum of policies and programs and health is a perfect illustration of that position.</para><para>I would like to take a few minutes now to mention the very significant steps that the government has taken and will continue to take in the area of education. The Howard government is committed to providing record sums of money to the nation's schools. Over the coming four-year period, 2005 to 2008, the government has allocated $33 billion for schools education. This includes $10.8 billion supplementary funding for state schools, $12.8 billion general recurrent funding for Catholic schools and $7.8 billion for independent schools. Funding for all non-government schools in Australia will in future be based on the socioeconomic status funding model which means that every non-government school will receive funding based on the same transparent and objective funding formula, based on independent data, consistent for all schools.</para><para>It is one of the government objectives in adopting this funding model that private investment in education in Australia should not be discouraged and therefore the model does not take into account a school's private income from fees or other resources, or its assets. Rather, the level of government support to each of the children in any given non-government school is determined by reference to the socioeconomic status of the families in the areas from which the students at that school are drawn. This is in stark contrast to the plans that the Labor Party had in store for non-government schools—which I do not think have been revised—should it have been elected on 9 October. The Labor Party planned to slash the funding of 67 schools in Victoria and New South Wales by $520 million over the next four years. Thirty-two of those schools are in Victoria and seven were in my electorate of Kooyong. Another five Kooyong schools would have had their funding capped at the present level. This would have affected over 13,500 students, almost half the number of students who attend school in my electorate and would have resulted in a loss of $40 million of funding over the next four years for the schools which were targeted. </para><para>I am proud to be a product of the government school system and I am fully supportive of that system. I was very proud when the Prime Minister announced, as part of the current funding commitment to school education in Australia, a further $1 billion to support infrastructure needs, libraries, computers et cetera at government and under resourced non-government schools. I believe this is innovation at its best, which is permitted by a strong and growing economy.</para><para>As I have said, innovation and change are important. I want to raise one area where I believe innovation and change are necessary and possible, and that is in the area of refugees and asylum seekers. Our policies towards asylum seekers were premised on concern about vast numbers of undeserving and potentially dangerous people landing on our shores. Today, unauthorised boat arrivals have all but ceased and the great majority of people they carried have turned out to be genuine refugees. There were no terrorists hiding amongst the asylum seekers. Globally the number of refugees has nearly halved during the last decade. Of particular significance to Australia is the fact that refugees have stopped flowing from Afghanistan and Iraq, two of the main source countries of asylum seekers coming here without visas.</para><para>If a crisis situation justifies severe measures and the crisis passes, on what basis can the severe measures be perpetuated? In brief, I believe that we need to release asylum seekers in detention, of whom there are only a couple of hundred, who have passed health and security checks and place them in the community until their applications have been processed. I believe that thousands of genuine refugees who have temporary protection visas should be given permanent residence in a one-off amnesty. But today I want to focus, albeit briefly, on the policy of indefinite detention. The average prison sentence for people convicted of rape and other sexual crimes in Victoria and New South Wales is just over four years and it is between two and three years for offenders guilty of robbery, abduction or kidnapping. In Australia's immigration detention centres there are people who have been locked up for more than four years, the longest being for more than six years. These people are detained indefinitely, potentially for life, because they have been found to be ineligible for an Australian visa and we cannot find another country to accept them.</para><para>In the US the nation's courts have recently drawn upon the bill of rights in the constitution to question the government assertion of complete authority to indefinitely detain immigrants who cannot be deported. The Australian Constitution has fewer provisions for the protection of human rights. In 2004, by a 4-3 majority, the High Court decided that the government had the legal power to indefinitely detain people it wished to deport even if it is in practice impossible to deport them. In the relevant case, Al-Kateb v Godwin, Mr Justice McHugh, one of the majority, said:</para><quote><para>As long as the detention is for the purpose of deportation or preventing aliens from entering Australia or the Australian community, the justice or wisdom of the course taken by the Parliament is not examinable in this or any other domestic court. It is not for courts, exercising federal jurisdiction, to determine whether the course taken by Parliament is unjust or contrary to basic human rights. </para></quote><para>The result of this policy is illustrated by Mohammed, or Peter, Qasim, who has spent more than six years in immigration detention and may be imprisoned for life. Mr Qasim and the department of immigration disagree about some of the circumstances of his situation. But what is beyond doubt is that Mr Qasim is not detained because he has been charged or convicted of any crime, nor is he suspected of terrorism nor is he in any respect alleged to constitute a danger to the Australian community. Mr Qasim has been detained for a period longer than the average sentence of imprisonment for robbers and rapists because he is ineligible for an Australian visa and we cannot find another country to take him. To put it simply, I believe that the policy of indefinite detention of people who have committed no crime—and I think this is a position actually supported by both sides of the parliament—and who pose no threat to the Australian community should not be sustained.</para><para>I would like to conclude by acknowledging the work of my many loyal supporters in Kooyong who have contributed time and effort year after year to my re-election campaign. I owe much to the chairman of my electorate council, Bill Clancy, and to his vice-chairman, Paul Davey, who filled in at the last minute so effectively during the conduct of my campaign. I say a heartfelt thank you to them, the team of volunteers—who organised fundraising events, who walked with me in all weather through the streets of the electorate and who dropped pamphlets in letterboxes—and all those Liberal Party members and friends who manned the polling booths on election day and during the pre-poll periods and visited so many hospitals and nursing homes and risked everything by displaying my posters on their front gardens, astonishingly attractive though they were. My staff deserve particular mention, and I am always grateful to them.</para><para>I am pleased to be back in this place and I recommit myself to serving the people of Kooyong and this parliament. I would like to welcome the new MPs from Victoria: Russell Broadbent, who had the only victory in a Labor seat in Victoria—and it is really good to see Russell back again—Andrew Robb and Jason Wood. I would also like to say farewell to Bob Charles and David Kemp, who served the government and the parliament well. I would like to congratulate Senator Judith Troeth, who had a stunning and deserved victory in the doubtful third Senate position in Victoria.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>160</page.no><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GRIERSON</name><name.id>00AMP</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The address-in-reply affords us the opportunity to reflect on the election of the 41st Parliament of Australia. Like my Labor colleagues, I am disappointed not to be in government and not to have the opportunity to deliver for my electorate of Newcastle policies that would have united us under shared opportunity, policies that would have encouraged individual and community achievement to prosper our collective economic fortunes, and policies that would have promoted our safety and security and restored our international reputation as a nation that uses its capacity to aid global harmony and prosperity. But that is not to be.</para></talk.start><para>In his election victory speech, the Prime Minister committed to govern for all Australians. The people of Newcastle intend to hold him to account for that pledge and we look forward to benefiting fairly from the Prime Minister's commitment over the next three years. Novocastrians too made a choice in that election. They registered their strong support for Labor's agenda, and for that I sincerely thank them. In fact, I am wonderfully proud that the people of Newcastle exercised their vote to deliver me the greatest pro-Labor swing in the country. I am the first to acknowledge that I represent the best electorate in Australia, where people vote not just for the good of themselves but also for the good of their community. In Newcastle we have a saying that there is only half a degree of separation between us. We know each other well because we band together in our neighbourhoods, our community and sporting clubs, our volunteer organisations and through those marvellous networks and associations built up over time, living lives that value the place we live in and the people who live there. It is a place where people still smile and talk to strangers, where generosity abounds and where pride and encouragement are extended to everyone who has a go. </para><para>Labor's election agenda was so strongly supported by Novocastrians because it offered shared economic progress and success. In Newcastle, that agenda would have seen $20 million in funding for our Energy Australia Stadium, the home of the Knights and Newcastle United Jets football teams, but also the home of parochial pride and celebration. Unfortunately the Prime Minister offered no contribution to this project which would have allowed our city to better compete for international sporting and entertainment events and gain the economic and employment benefits of increased tourism. I encourage the Prime Minister to have a fresh look at this issue, with a view to facilitating growth in regional economies—forming genuine regional partnerships in all regional economies and not just in seats the coalition holds or wishes to hold at elections.</para><para>Newcastle voters also favoured Labor's commitment to restore regional status to our university—something we sorely miss. It is important to understand that in regions universities are very special places. Unlike the sandstone universities, regional universities depend on good regional partnerships for their success, and regions depend on universities for their success as well. In this partnership, research and entrepreneurship are facilitated, student needs are understood and responded to locally, sponsorship is assisted and the purpose of the university is embedded within the community. The Department of Education, Science and Training recently sponsored a regional engagement forum at our university, which suggests that they see it as a regional university. It is logical, then, that the outcomes and strategies from that forum could best be enacted if regional status and attached funding were available in 2005, particularly when our outstanding research record is viewed against regional business linkages. Minister Nelson, we would welcome your sensible intervention to reinstate regional status to the University of Newcastle.</para><para>Labor's election commitment to provide 40 additional medical places at the University of Newcastle to respond to the GP shortage in our region was also understood and appreciated by the voters of Newcastle. As our university specialises in training GPs, it could accommodate those places instantly. As doctors who train in regional universities generally end up practising in the regions, this would benefit electorates, both Labor and coalition, throughout the Hunter, New England, Central Coast and North Coast regions. Given the attrition rate of GPs in regional Australia, I again urge Minister Nelson and Minister Abbott to confer and bring additional places on line at the University of Newcastle with some urgency. Additional places in central Sydney do not make much sense, given that the majority of medical work force shortages are in regional Australia.</para><para>Providing after-hours GP services was also a Labor priority, with a commitment given by our shadow minister for health to maintain funding at current levels to our highly successful GP access after-hours service. This service originated in the Hunter and its trial and expansion was supported by the coalition. That was welcomed by all of us. In fact, this excellent model has become the benchmark for similar services around the country. However, Minister Abbott was dragged screaming and kicking to support ongoing funding by the hard work of the people of the Hunter and Newcastle who made it clear, through media, letters and petitions of support, that they expected any government, Labor or Liberal, to fund what works and works well to manage the emergency health care of communities. So we look forward to adequate and continuing funding to the Hunter GP access after-hours service. </para><para>This week already we have heard much about the national skills shortage crisis. The Reserve Bank of Australia have identified it as a major factor in restraining our export performance, particularly in non-commodity exports such as manufacturing. In Newcastle we have been trying to tell the government about the skills shortage for quite a long time. In fact, the millennium skills report prepared some years ago by our region pointed to this looming shortage, but unfortunately this was not responded to by the Howard government. In the election Labor well understood the need to overcome the skills shortage in Newcastle and the Hunter. Labor's commitment to providing special skill-up and youth link-up initiatives in our region appealed to our community, ever concerned for the future of our young people, who continue to face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country. Special support is needed to increase school retention rates and to use the talents of our youth to the best advantage for this nation's productivity. In Newcastle we would welcome a hand up for our young people from this government.</para><para>Unfortunately, it seems that all the government has offered is a new technical college for regions with skill shortages. As a former principal I have some major problems with this initiative on several grounds, but particularly because it ignores existing initiatives by TAFEs and schools to advance vocational education in collaboration with local industry, according to local needs. It is already happening in prosperous regions, in regions that are willing to find their own solutions. For example, in my region a highly successful call centre training program was initiated in response to growing industry demand. Similarly, hospitality partnerships have also been successful in overcoming skill deficiencies. In the traditional trades areas, where there is a major gap, our local group training companies have had some outstanding successes through their partnerships with industry and TAFEs. If government had listened to them, and responded to their advice earlier, then we would not have had the skills crisis that currently hampers growth and compounds our current account deficit. But the political reality is that the Howard government has neglected the great manufacturing regions like Newcastle and the Hunter. We would wonder whether there is a selective disregard for Labor held areas. Only now that we have the largest current account deficit in the nation's history is the government taking notice.</para><para>As for the new technical colleges, I applaud the local solution being put forward by HunterNet—the manufacturing industry cluster group—the Hunter Institute of TAFE and the Australian Industry Group in my electorate to work in partnership with local schools to deliver this program. It is a model they are putting forward to the government in response to their request to get these colleges going. Only local approaches with efficient use of existing local resources will be able to adequately respond to resolving the skills shortages. But, at best, this solution, with only 300 students catered for, will be only a token measure given the scale of the problem. </para><para>Affordable child care and predictable financial support when raising children were seen as vital to the economic prosperity of Newcastle families. They are right. Data released recently shows that fertility decline in the regions is five times greater than the average across the state of New South Wales. That should be worrying to all members of parliament. Does that mean the end of rural communities? I repeat: the rate of fertility decline in the regions is five times greater than the state average. Voters supported policies that increased resources to child-care centres and recognised the need for child-care workers to be trained and rewarded. They rejected the taxation concession approach put forward by the government that meant the more you paid for child care the more you could claim on your tax return. Again, that is another selective policy that favours those on highest incomes. I thank Sharan Burrow from the ACTU for supporting this social area of need, and certainly for supporting my campaign in Newcastle.</para><para>When it comes to taxation and incomes, Newcastle voters did not forget that in Peter Costello's last budget he chose to overlook 90 per cent of them—those people who actually earn less than $52,000 per year. I do not think that those of us on comfortable salaries look around enough and see how much ordinary Australians earn. Perhaps low-wage earners have not forgotten just how hard the government resisted increases to the minimum wage over the past three years.</para><para>Had Labor been elected, 64 out of 65 schools in my electorate, be they public or private, would have received more funding, and more students seeking places at TAFE and university would have gained entry because of Labor's increase in funded places. We would also have seen the 25 per cent HECS hike removed, and perhaps our university would have not faced reduced enrolments this year—what has turned out to be a national trend, predicted by Labor. If you are going to keep burdening young people they will turn away. That is exactly what has happened. They have turned away from the economic burden of being a tertiary student under a government that increases the user pays approach to gaining higher education in what we like to call `the clever country'.</para><para>Newcastle's support for Labor's health policies, supporting Medicare Gold and retaining bulk-billing, remained as strong as ever. We have a proud public health tradition in Newcastle and the Hunter, and we understand the economic health and social dividends that result from investing more into the public health system. Sadly, only in the last few weeks, another GP has closed his doors in my electorate. I say `sadly' because this GP faces a health crisis of his own. He is only a young man and it is going to be a very difficult time for him. He had to abandon his practice; he could not find a locum. He could not find any GP to take it over. Why was that? Because he bulk-bills. It is a bulk-billing practice with a mostly aged population. That is just tragic. What does it say about the success of Minister Abbott's rescue efforts for Medicare? Just more failure and more distress to an overworked profession and to their patients. It remains the biggest shame in this nation that we cannot provide GP services to all Australians.</para><para>I have now fought two election campaigns in which I have been the candidate. Having been a member of the Labor Party for well over 25 years, I can say that it is certainly different when you are the candidate. In the first campaign, in 2001, I benefited a great deal from Newcastle's traditional support for Labor and from the good efforts of my predecessor, Allan Morris. But this campaign was one where, even though national issues and campaign tactics had a major influence, there was an element of appraisal of my own performance. That can be very challenging. But I was a very fortunate candidate to have had the support of so many Labor members and friends, not to mention a wonderful family and staff. They are too numerous to name individually, but I wish to formally thank my entire campaign team and all volunteers who supported our belief and determination to provide a better government. </para><para>I also thank my caucus executive colleagues and our national campaign directorate for their support of my campaign. They were very obliging in visiting Newcastle, listening to the people and developing policy that really responded to Newcastle's needs. They genuinely understood those needs and did their best to incorporate that into policy and election activities. I again pledge my devoted service to the people of Newcastle and give my assurance that, while ever I hold the seat, the government will be well aware of our needs and reminded of our contribution to this great country. I also assure the people of Newcastle that under my representation Labor will never be able to take them for granted nor will they ever be able to take for granted the loyal support that Newcastle has shown to Labor for 104 years.</para><para>Election campaigns also bring sadness and regret. The results can show a randomness that sees talented people of compassion and dedication leave this place. For Labor, we lost some wonderful caucus colleagues, and I particularly pay tribute to my friend Sharryn Jackson, the former member for Hasluck, who constantly inspired me—I do miss her—with her love for her electorate and her constant championing of their concerns. She is sorely missed.</para><para>Since the election there have been other losses too, in particular for Labor the loss of our former leader Mark Latham due to ill health. I express on the public record my gratitude and respect for his efforts to provide a real alternative for the Australian people. Mark was a man of big ideas and bold visions, but he was also a man with the common touch who valued the contributions of all Australians. His pride in this country and his passionate belief in Labor's principles were evident for everyone to see. He saw a wonderful link between Labor's policies and the strength and goodness of the Australian people—a link I know he wished to nourish and sustain with policies that he believed would lead to greater prosperity, security and national achievement within a social framework that valued the spirit of fairness and generosity to others. He also is missed. I extend my gratitude and best wishes to Mark, particularly for the challenges he faces with his health. I thank him very much for his dedication to Labor.</para><para>The leadership baton for Labor now rests with Kim Beazley. I am not quite sure if Kim will return as patron to the Knights and be seen running up Red Hill in his Knights jersey but I know that, like the Knights, our local football heroes, he is hungry for victory in our political version of the grand final. I am proud and privileged to once more be part of this parliament and I am proud and privileged to be part of the Labor opposition leader's quest for government of this great nation. We are a great nation with a great spirit.</para><para>I pay tribute to the overwhelming generosity displayed by Australians to our neighbours in the tragic aftermath of the tsunami. It showed that we have a commitment to helping others. We have a collective strength in that way. Australians have matured to the point where we now see our neighbours in a more global sense. We know that part of the responsibility of living in the lucky country is giving aid and comfort to our regional neighbours. The majority of financial aid that leaves these shores in normal times comes from the pockets of ordinary Australians. We truly are generous and caring. </para><para>I want to draw attention to comments by a young doctor. I tried to find his name, but I have not been successful. He was awarded an Australia Day national honour for his assistance as part of medical teams who treated the victims of the Bali bombings. In his interview he said something very special. He said that he had been humbled by the experience of treating Australians. He said that, to a man and woman at that time, everyone he treated told him to help another person first, as that person's need was greater than their own. In my role as a parliamentarian I have learnt that the greatest inspiration comes from the extraordinary feats of ordinary Australians.</para><para>Sadly, in my electorate we recently saw the worst of the human spirit, when a small group of racists sought to vilify our new Sudanese residence. Newcastle has almost 500 Sudanese refugees who have been sponsored by the Newcastle community. In response to this attack by a few—I think dangerous—people, Newcastle rose up and supported our Sudanese community and celebrated our multicultural diversity. It will live with me for a long time that 600 people came together in a massive celebration. Having just heard the member for Kooyong talk about Qasim, who has been in a detention centre here for over six years, I can only say that it was very sad to hear a Sudanese man of approximately 40 years of age say that he was born in a refugee camp, that he had lived his entire life in a refugee camp and that his children were born in a refugee camp. It is wonderful that we can offer these people some hope. The celebration was a very moving experience, and I pay tribute to the people of Newcastle. It is a privilege to represent them.</para><para>In conclusion, I want to raise a sensitive matter. I have a great deal of respect and appreciation for the professional way in which the staff in Parliament House—political, electorate and parliamentary—support the government of this country. However, in the past three years I have been alarmed at times by the treatment of interjectors in the public gallery. Although this is an infrequent occurrence, on too many occasions the response to interjectors has in my view been excessively physical. On those particular occasions no warning appeared to have been given. No attempts seem to have been made to explain the consequences or actions that would have to be taken to remove the person from the gallery. Unfortunately, at times the force applied seemed excessive relative to the actions of those causing the problem and to the restraining power needed to escort the offenders from the gallery.</para><para>As a member of parliament I am always grateful for the vigilance of our security personnel and acknowledge that they are placed in the front line of potential risk and, consequently, do respond with the thoughts of possible worst-case scenarios uppermost in their minds. But this remains the people's house and, as we watch those walls being built around our perimeters, we have a responsibility to ensure that Australia's democracy is visible and accessible to the people we represent. It is therefore essential that our security staff members are each given the best training possible to respond to critical incidents appropriately. I urge attention to this matter by those charged with this responsibility. We are fortunate in this House to have an open, inclusive government. It must continue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>165</page.no><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name><name.id>CK6</name.id><electorate>Moreton</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Vocational and Technical Education and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am greatly honoured to be able to stand here as the member for Moreton and to reaffirm the commitment I have made on each occasion, at the commencement of the now four parliaments to which I have been elected, to maintain my focus, my attention, on matters within my electorate as my first call of duty.

I am always conscious that people are never afraid to walk up to me in local shopping centres and at community events and remind me that I attended school with them, their daughter, their son or, in more recent years, their parents. As a local lad I am very greatly honoured to be in this place to do my best to represent the views and concerns of the good people of this part of Australia.</para><para>I want to briefly report upon the 2004 election campaign and work my way through a number of issues that are of importance to the local electorate. The No. 1 issue in my electorate was very clearly a lack of faith in the alternative that was presented. Economic management was a point of reckoning for people. Interest rates became an example to people, particularly in those fast-developing suburbs of Calamvale, Parkinson and Drewvale and through Eight Mile Plains, Runcorn, Stretton and Sunnybank Hills. In those suburbs, where people have invested in themselves and their families, people were very—and rightly—concerned about the lack of clarity, the lack of ability and the lack of experience that was being offered by the alternative. They spoke very loudly and very strongly in that regard. People were saying to me that clearly the Australian Labor Party are not the party that they had once voted for and that they do not represent real people any more. There is an enormous amount of work that those opposite have got to do. They have to look within themselves to realise that they are the custodians of what is now a failed party that has a lot of work to do to try to restore some sense of faith in average Australians. I am sure that they will do that and I guess, from the point of view of a solid political debate, one would hope they get on with that task.</para><para>I had people say to me that they had concerns about some aspects of the tough decisions the government made. At Calamvale College one man said, `I wasn't happy over the war in Iraq, but I do not trust and do not believe the Australian Labor Party can properly represent me or, indeed, would be a safe bet for this country, so I am voting for you.' I thank that gentleman, because I think it is important that people do express those sorts of views in that sort of way. It is a positive gesture from that man, whose name I do not know, but I was very pleased to receive his support last October.</para><para>But the key issues, apart from the Australian Labor Party and people's genuine concerns, were the infrastructure and transport issues in my electorate. The Australian Labor Party promised a quick pot of money to try to deal with some of these issues. There was no plan that underpinned it, though. Labor essentially wanted and still want—I noticed the member for Wills, the Labor Party spokesman on these things, in the House yesterday—to put more trucks through my local area. They actually want to direct more interstate trucks down the Brisbane Urban Corridor, which is Kessels Road in my electorate. The alternative that the Howard government has planned is the AusLink proposal. It is a way around this important issue, and now even the Queensland government are acknowledging that AusLink has something to offer. </para><para>The Queensland transport minister, Paul Lucas, understands my passion. He campaigned against me in the last election. He and I have traded a few blows over the past 12 months, but I have to say to you that I have had meetings with Paul Lucas and I am very satisfied that, since the election, he knows that people want an end to the sense of jurisdictional battles on these issues. I applaud his commitment, along with that of Minister Jim Lloyd and, before him, Minister Ian Campbell, in dealing with these issues in a proper, planned and coordinated way. I do not apologise to Paul Lucas for standing up strongly to him on behalf of my constituents. I can assure him and the House that I have given stick where needed to my ministerial colleagues for exactly the same reason—and I certainly will not stop doing that.</para><para>So what have we done? The Australian government are now financing a removal of the toll on the Southern Brisbane Bypass at night. They are doing that because 40 per cent of the trucks that go through my electorate would use the alternative if the toll was not there, and we want to get some real data. The Queensland government are now cooperating and taking the million or so dollars that we are putting on the table for this. That toll trial will start at the end of this month of February. This is fantastic news.</para><para>There is more that I want. I want to see the Persse Road toll plaza taken out completely. This toll plaza impedes the good progress and the good use of local road assets. We see too many cars on Gowan Road through Stretton and Calamvale as people from south of my electorate motor around that toll plaza and go up Warrigal Road at Eight Mile Plains and Runcorn. I want to see an end to that and I have spoken to Paul Lucas about this. We are in the business of working together. The Queensland government are making a contribution as well. I acknowledge that a numberplate recognition technology being installed now along the Kessels Road corridor will mean that trucks that are using this road instead of using the toll road in the toll-free trial period will be asked why they are there. Their numberplate will be photographed and the driver will be followed up—I see no problems with that.</para><para>I have to say to those who have listened to my comments in this place and publicly over the last eight years on this subject that my consistent approach has now been vindicated both by the Australian government's AusLink plan and by the cooperative actions of the Queensland government. I welcome that.</para><para>There is also a federal and state feasibility study to look at the engineering solutions for the Kessels-Mains roads bottleneck, and I welcome that. But again we saw yesterday that the Australian Labor Party have learnt absolutely nothing from the federal election campaign, because the Labor Party are still saying, `No, let's just dig the ditch; let's put the overpass in.' That is a signal for more trucks through my electorate. I will not stand idly by and allow the Labor Party to put more trucks through my area. We need a proper plan. There is no need to build that overpass until we know that the big trucks are off the local roads. The overpass can come but not before the trucks are gone.</para><para>Then there is the overpass that is needed on Beaudesert Road at Acacia Ridge to replace the level crossing on the Sydney-Brisbane rail line. Beaudesert Road is a state road, the rail line is in fact owned by the Queensland government, and yet Queensland state members and the federal Labor Party are saying the federal government should build this overpass. I say we would if the state government would cooperate with the Australian government's AusLink proposal and lease that rail line from Brisbane to the border. We are trying to bring the Brisbane freight equation into the 21st century and provide a rail line that actually works on 21st-century standards. The New South Wales government has signed up on the Sydney-Brisbane rail plan, but the 130 kilometres from the Queensland border to Brisbane is going to wallow in early 20th-century technology at best unless we get the progress that we are calling for. I am hoping that, in the spirit of cooperation that now seems to be there from the Queensland government, Minister Lucas and Minister Anderson will get a satisfactory result. That last 130 kilometres needs to be in that form of agreement because then, under AusLink, we will plan and build infrastructure improvements, including that overpass at Acacia Ridge. </para><para>As the local federal member and as a long-term resident I have always supported the use of that rail corridor—which is only used for that interstate rail operation—as an extension of the Brisbane city rail service. It is outrageous to think that, in 2005, suburbs like Algester, Calamvale and Parkinson and, indeed, places as far south as the electorate of my colleague from Forde are not served by a rail system. It is one of the reasons why local roads in my electorate are being choked with cars, because people are in cars rather than on trains. Those are big-ticket items. They have been part of my efforts over the last eight years or so since being elected as the federal member in this place and they will continue to be part of my activity until we get the results that local people expect of me.</para><para>My electorate is now the most culturally diverse electorate in the entire state of Queensland. My previous portfolio of Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs meant that I learnt a lot from my local community which I could then use, not by way of judgment, but as a point of comparison with the conduct of communities in other places. My community has lots of people from lots of places. It means that while we are a fairly small pond by comparison with places in Western Sydney we, nevertheless, are a very happy pond.</para><para>We will, as is always the case, have infectious Chinese New Year events. We have already been to a couple. They will happen all through this week, and probably this month, throughout my electorate. Many of the local Islamic community have come from places like South Africa and Zimbabwe. They are professional people who have brought enormous skills; 96 per cent of the Muslims who have come from South Africa and Zimbabwe to Queensland have come as business migrants. They have brought investment opportunities and skills.</para><para>In the last few weeks they have been involved in the business of raising enormous amounts of money for the tsunami appeal. I was pleased to attend a function which, with other efforts raising funds from local mosques, pulled together some $200,000. Last weekend we saw children on a walkathon. It was kids for kids, raising funds under the organisational auspices of Crescents of Brisbane, getting kids to understand that they can make a difference. These are great examples of a local community digging deep and doing good things. It is also a good testimony of a community, particularly the Islamic community, that has had a difficult time in recent years. It has affected me as a person. It has affected my conduct as a member of parliament. I am very, very proud to know these people.</para><para>We also have many people who are new to Australia and have come from the Horn of Africa—from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia. An enormous number of people have come from Sudan. We know that they are there because the <inline font-style="italic">Courier Mail</inline> discovered that in the last seven days. I have talked proudly about these people wherever I have gone around the country and will continue to do so. They are people who understand what it is like to have nothing. When they come to a country like Australia—where freedom is a given and where liberty, the right to do everything that is permitted by law, is something they have never known before they have come to this place—it really reminds us about exactly who we are and where we come from. I am very proud to be part of the Liberal Party of Australia, which, from the founder on, has always said that no racial or religious caveat applies to its sense of respect for the rights of an individual. I am pleased to maintain that approach. </para><para>One of the ways in which we have been able to bring citizens of long standing and citizens of new standing together has been through the infection of locally based community citizenship ceremonies. On Australia Day this year I was pleased to preside on behalf of Peter McGauran, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, at the first ever university based citizenship ceremony, at Griffith University. I praise the Griffith University Lions Club for their efforts in convening it. The Brisbane Macgregor Lions Club, whose community service knows no bounds, sponsored the event at Macgregor state primary school hall. On that day there were also the Moreton community awards—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Hatton)</inline>—Does the honourable member seek to intervene?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Danby</name></talker><para>—I do.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name></talker><para>—I would like to continue my speech on behalf of my electorate.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The intervention is declined.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name></talker><para>—I would like the member for Melbourne Ports to take it up at another time.

Ivan drove Iris to every event. He was rightly awarded. John Allen, of Ekibin Lions Club, who lives at Yeronga, has had 16 years involvement there fundraising in every possible way. He was a torchbearer for the Sydney Olympics. John Allen has always made it possible for young people to see the uniform he walked in and the torch he carried.</para></talk.start></continue><para>John Corless, of Yeronga, is perhaps an unsung hero of the Australian Football League in Queensland, in that he has been dedicated to this sport and its development through local schools such as Yeronga state school. He has been President of Yeronga AFL since 1991. Melvena Hallam, of Algester, has for eight years worked without fail for three days a week at the Veterans Support and Advocacy Service. Wally Sefjack, of Macgregor, is a US-born citizen who has love and passion for a sense of good citizenry in Australia. His involvement through the Sunnybank RSL rightly afforded him this sort of note in dispatch. It was a very emotional moment. There were many members from the local QE2 hospital auxiliary—people who have made such a difference in that organisation, which has raised over $1.4 million over the past 20 years.</para><para>Perhaps the most emotional award went to Mrs Barbara Saranin, who accepted the award on behalf of her late husband, Alex. Alex Saranin was Russian born and came to Australia via Shanghai. His story—the things he and his family went through, both in Russia and in China, in their escape to this country in the post-Communist revolution era—and his application and effort in our local community were very inspiring. He wrote a book which he has handed on to others to read—a book which I would certainly endorse to all others. His local Nathan Neighbourhood Watch group, who do so much good community work, humbled and honoured him when they named their good neighbour award after him. </para><para>Speaking of Neighbourhood Watch, we continue to have a very strong, effective and capable community response where people are adding to the thin blue line of policing, working in partnership with the local police service to make a difference. I am very proud to offer support to each of them. In places like Algester and Calamvale, which are new to my electorate, I have been happy to engage in their activities. At Stretton they run a wonderful barbecue and picnic event each year that brings the community together. It is great to see, as well as those activities in longer established areas such as Chelmer, Graceville, Sherwood, Tennyson, Yeronga and Moorooka.</para><para>I was very pleased to see a constituent of mine Jenny Bobeszko, who was the chairperson of the Brisbane South regional support group, was noted at the state Neighbourhood Watch rally held on election day last year as the regional community member of the year award recipient. I think it is right that we acknowledge her leadership and her involvement.</para><para>In the years ahead one of the new portfolio challenges is the important area of ensuring that young people feel empowered by the choices they make through their schooling lives and are able to progress in a positive and constructive way from their schooldays to their work days through further opportunities in apprenticeships in the trade skills. My local electorate actually offers me an enormous amount of instruction on this as well.</para><para>In my electorate there are long-established partnerships between business and high schools, which will continue to have an impact on the conduct in my new portfolio responsibilities. The Southside Cluster Industry Placement Scheme, the SCIPS program, chaired by Cameron Innes and so well administered by Carmel Dalton, involves schools in and around my electorate, including Clairvaux MacKillop College, Yeronga State High School, Our Lady's College at Annerley, Runcorn State High School and Holland Park High School. They also provide a pay-as-you-use service to Macgregor State High School.</para><para>They have over 700 students involved in 1,200 placements—some students are sent out more than once. It is a good scheme. It shows you that the local community in my electorate took up the challenges issued by the federal government in about 1997 and indeed by the short-lived state coalition government of that era to engage in these sorts of programs. It is not well understood that of the school based new apprentices around the country over half of them are in Queensland, which is an indictment of states like New South Wales and Victoria especially. Over half of them are in Queensland, but unfortunately not enough of them are in the traditional trades.</para><para>I pay tribute to former minister Dr Kemp, who set in train these sorts of structures, and to former ministers in that short-lived coalition government—the now Liberal leader, Bob Quinn, and now Liberal senator for Queensland, Santo Santoro. They were ministers for education and training at a time when these new structures came into place. The maturity of those in Queensland, particularly in my electorate, set me some very good examples to look for in other places. </para><para>I thank the Liberal Party division of Moreton for their faith in me as their candidate, now on four occasions. I promise to continue to work hard for all involved.

I want to record my thanks to the people of the electorate of Canberra for placing their trust in me as their federal representative.</para></talk.start><para>The result we received in this electorate, with an increase in the primary vote, could not have been achieved without the hard work and assistance of many people. There is my staff—Kathryn, Chris, Daniel, Rose, Shaun and Helen—who face the daily challenges with me and who display great loyalty not only to me but to our supporters and, most importantly, to our community. There are all those wonderful people in the local Australian Labor Party who had to face two elections within seven days, yet were willing and able to get out and work so hard to ensure our local success. There are also all the volunteers who phoned or called in to offer their help. My sincere thanks to each one of you. In my role as a shadow minister it is difficult, given the level of resources available to us in opposition. However, I thank Victoria, who worked long and hard with me last term in our two areas of responsibility—namely, ageing and seniors, and disabilities.</para><para>I am extremely proud to represent the community of Canberra—an electorate with an electoral enrolment of 109,476 voters at the time of the election. Our community is no different to any other in Australia. We share similar aspirations and hopes. We have similar concerns and stresses. We are very resilient, ready to support each other through those unexpected challenges. The devastating fires of January 2003 certainly displayed that characteristic. Some commentators observed that this showed that Canberra really did have a heart. We reckon they never really knew us and that that heart was always evident. </para><para>It seems appropriate that the seat of Canberra—in the Australian Capital Territory, which was created specifically to hold the government of this country—can claim connections to so many other towns, cities and nations. At the last census 17,664 people who were born in Europe lived in the seat of Canberra. There were 7,252 people from Asia, 933 from subSaharan Africa, and 871 from North Africa and the Middle East. Just over 24 per cent of my constituents—a bit over 37,000 people—were born overseas and now call the seat of Canberra home. Whether we were born in Woden, Wangaratta or Western Samoa, we are all Canberrans and very proud of our city. We happen to live in the nation's capital, of which we are all extremely proud. It is a beautiful city with a special role, and we all take our part in that role very seriously.</para><para>I am also pleased to have the opportunity to reflect on a couple of issues that I see as important in identifying who we are as a nation. It has been said that we can judge ourselves by how we treat others. I also see this test as a window into our collective conscience. I want to refer to the state of the health of our Indigenous Australians and, in so doing, turn to the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Health is life</inline><inline font-style="italic">.</inline> This report of the inquiry into Indigenous health by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs was presented to this House in May 2000. The committee received the reference from the government to conduct that inquiry. The report was a product of over two years work, involving a number of members of this House, and it is fair to say that we all desperately hoped that this report would really make a difference. It is 4½ years later, and I find it extremely distressing every time I read another front page headline or hear another news report telling us how serious the situation of Indigenous health is. The statistics are trotted out, we all agree the figures are appalling—and so on it goes. I quote from the foreword of the report:</para><quote><para>The continuing poor state of Indigenous health, and the many efforts of successive governments to address the issue, has seemingly left a nation at a loss to know what to do for the best on this issue.</para></quote><para>It went on:</para><quote><para>We know that there are no easy answers to the issues of Indigenous health and all participants in the Inquiry acknowledged the long road ahead, but we believe that our Report offers some signposts to the future.</para></quote><para>What we desperately need is leadership on this issue. We acknowledge that it would be unlikely to see significant improvement until the fragmentation of services, the cost-shifting and the lack of agreement on responsibility for Indigenous health are fully addressed. The committee agreed:</para><quote><para>... that for this to happen there must be a clear agreement between the states and the Commonwealth, not only about what their respective responsibilities are but also on how these responsibilities will be acted upon and the level of resources to be committed by all parties.</para></quote><para>It seems the realities of today remain the same: in general terms, Indigenous Australians are more likely to be unemployed or on lower incomes, less educated, imprisoned or in some form of care, homeless or living in overcrowded or substandard conditions, as well as being unwell or dying earlier than the non-Indigenous population. The life expectancy of Indigenous Australians is about 18 years shorter than for other Australians. Their age adjusted mortality is about three times the non-Indigenous rate and much higher with respect to some conditions. </para><para>An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 19 November 2004 entitled `Crowded houses are home to the plight of poverty' quoted the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Amanda Vanstone:</para><quote><para>... communities had to take responsibility for maintenance and repairs. There was to be “no more build and abandon”.</para></quote><para>The article went on:</para><quote><para>“The current state of housing is an indication the current approach is in need of change,” Senator Vanstone said. “More money, or more of the same, won't work.”</para></quote><para>The same article indicated that $2.295 billion would be required to address the Indigenous housing shortfall.</para><para>The committee's report discussed in some detail the question of maintenance and training. In relation to this issue the report talked about:</para><quote><para>... an innovative national training program about maintenance skills that is not at the trade level, but which is formal and accredited and could be extended with subsequent training to trade qualifications. Existing trade programs should continue to be supported and expanded where possible.</para><para>Focussing on ongoing maintenance and health hardware work in the communities on a long-term basis provides the potential for long-term meaningful employment which will also have considerable health benefits.</para></quote><para>It is now 4½ years since that report was produced, and where do we find ourselves today? Well, late last year we had a debate opening up in the media and elsewhere about mutual obligation—agreements calling on the community to guarantee certain behaviours such as washing children's faces, putting out the garbage, ensuring children shower every day and get to school on time, and so on. And, in return, the federal government would supply, in one case, $172,260 to provide and install petrol bowsers in a particular town. Mutually agreed approaches are not in themselves unacceptable, but we must ask: how far is this method of provision of basic service going to go?</para><para>We are all aware of the courageous action of Michael Long and the `long walk' initiative late last year. I had the opportunity of joining the walk for a brief time here in Canberra and, with many others from our community, offering my support. Following Michael Long's walk to Canberra the Prime Minister met with him and others. Some commentators at the time welcomed the Prime Minister putting the issues on the agenda: `What a good thing to have this discussion! We are now offered an opportunity we cannot ignore'—and so on, basically cheering the so-called intervention of the PM at the time. Of course that is a good thing. The point is that these issues should never be off the agenda. It should not take a walk by Michael Long or anyone else to have the Prime Minister of this country acknowledge the issues facing our Indigenous communities around the country.</para><para>The issues are diverse; they are not simple. And we all share some responsibility for the continuing poor state of health, education, employment and opportunity affecting our Indigenous communities. Some of us in this House had the opportunity through that committee inquiry to visit many city, rural and very remote Indigenous communities. We saw some wonderful examples where sheer determination and self-belief were winning out. We also saw some shocking examples of poor planning and infrastructure development, lack of care and accountability that verged, I have to admit, on the incomprehensible. How will these mutual obligation arrangements fix, for example, the construction of a community rubbish tip up hill from the houses, causing leaching into the soil? Or the construction of a new health centre including a badly needed dental care service but no funding for the dentist? Or the high rate of otitis media—commonly known as glue ear—in young children but a visit by or access to qualified audiology services being virtually impossible? Or the construction of new housing but no potable water connected to the houses? Or the supply of affordable—I repeat, affordable—fresh food in a community despite the very high cost of transportation which is also severely affected during wet season rains with road closures and flooding? Or the sense in medical evacuation from northern WA to Perth rather than across the border to Darwin because of questions as to who pays for what? Or the supply of a bus for a youth program, the funding of which precludes the elderly in the same town being allowed to use the same bus? </para><para>The examples are many and I could go on at length. I cannot see how these types of fundamental issues can be improved by a mutual obligation agreement, and I am not suggesting that they should or can be. What I am suggesting is that the federal government in a leadership role address the fundamental issues of governance, cost shifting and jurisdictional divide, and begin to move those blockages to some of the solutions along with their colleagues in the states and territories. I now turn to recommendation 1 of that report, which states:</para><quote><para>The Commonwealth accept it has the major responsibility for the provision of primary health care to Indigenous Australians:</para><para>The Commonwealth must assume responsibility for developing, in collaboration with the States and Territories, an efficient, coordinated and effective mechanism for the delivery of services and programs which impact on the health and well-being of the Indigenous population.</para></quote><para>Yes, the Indigenous people and their communities have roles and responsibilities but it is a two-way street. Let us encourage and support our Indigenous people and work with them. Mutually agreeable arrangements should be supported. However, government must be clear in what it is doing. Its responsibilities, I have to say, are clear to me. I urge the government to outline to this parliament what has been done in practical ways to address the health issues facing our Indigenous population.</para><para>The other issue I want to speak about is policy affecting our people with a disability. The new administrative arrangements of this government, I believe, show the transfer of disability support pension payments away from social security, and they are now the concern of the Minister for Workforce Participation. I note this change of governance with some concern. Let us look very carefully at this government's record and question their intent with the administrative arrangement. The government is using the results of a recent pilot study into DSP employment assistance to support their intent to coerce DSP recipients off pensions and into work. The Minister for Workforce Participation issued the results of the pilot study outlined in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> on 25 November. It was claimed that of 671 participants with disabilities who receive intensive assistance from Job Network providers one-third found employment or enrolled in education courses within six months. The minister said that the results showed that people with disabilities were `willing to work' and he went on to say:</para><quote><para>For those people that we think aren't there legitimately, then we need to try to adopt some coercion ... That's unfortunate in that minority of cases ...</para></quote><para>This government talks about coercion—a government that has done little to support any constructive move from welfare to work for people with disabilities. It is a government that in some cases has actually failed in the funding of programs designed to support these people. </para><para>Before the minister goes off and draws up his plan for coercion, he should look a little bit more closely at this pilot study. For example, 62 per cent of the participants had previously indicated a willingness to work by being registered with Centrelink as looking for work. The DSP recipients in the pilot were those who did not have any ongoing support requirements. The DSP participants volunteered. The pilot was not designed to canvass a cross-section of DSP participants and cannot expect results representative of the general DSP population. They are just a few points on a quick look at the study. It should be no surprise to the government that many people on DSP would dearly love to be back at work and not be reliant on welfare support. You do not need a study to know this; you just need to speak with them. They will tell you very clearly the problems they encounter in trying to get back to work full time, part time or casually. The reality is clear. Unfortunately people with a disability are less likely to be in the work force than those with no disability.</para><para>Consider these statistics. In the last financial year just under 10 per cent of people on the disability support pension had employment related earnings, that is around 63,000 people out of a population of 673,000. Australia has the seventh lowest employment rate in the OECD for people with a disability. According to the 2003 OECD employment outlook, Australian people with a disability had just over a 40 per cent chance of finding employment. In comparison, people with no disability had a 70 to 80 per cent chance of finding work. Nearly two-thirds of the OECD countries measured had better employment rates than Australia for people with a disability than for people with no disability. So it is not hard to imagine why people with a disability are less likely to be in the work force. I have heard many stories of people facing discrimination which may even lead to them giving up looking for a job. Others may not have access to the support they need to find employment. Some of the other challenges faced by people with a disability who want to work include low self-esteem, social isolation, dependence on welfare, poor education and transport issues.</para><para>This government has undertaken massive reforms in the disability employment sector, but no reforms are worthy unless they serve the people directly affected—that is, the people with a disability. That should be the sole motive. This pilot sounds more like another reform to suit a government agenda. While it talks about the importance of people with a disability entering the work force and the need for employers to be more innovative in this area, the Howard government over the years has employed fewer people with a disability. For example, the proportion of people with a disability employed by the Commonwealth government has decreased from 5.7 per cent in 1993 to 3.6 per cent in 2002. As I have said, any reforms can only be considered legitimate if people with a disability and their families and carers are the central focus of the reforms under consideration. Anything other than that represents a government on its own philosophical path.</para><para>It must be noted that this government tied the release of funding for 17,200 additional disability employment places to cutting the fortnightly pensions of 200,000 disability pensioners by more than $50—an initiative not agreed to by this parliament. I repeat: 17,200 additional disability support places from this government depended on people agreeing that 200,000 disability pensioners have their incomes cut. Because that did not happen, those 17,200 additional places did not come. I do not know what other people think about a government that does that, but I know what I think: it is pretty poor. </para><para>People with disabilities who are seeking to return to work must have access to appropriate services, support and adequately trained advisers within the job placement services and, most importantly, they must be given encouragement and time to allow that transition. I strongly support the proposal made by the Acting Disability Discrimination Commissioner, Dr Sev Ozdowski, for a public inquiry on the issues affecting equal employment opportunity for people with a disability in Australia. This is vital, given the government's track record in this area. The whole question of people with a disability in this country being employable, being happy to be employed and being able to be employed will not be enhanced by a government acting in a coercive manner. It will be enhanced if the government works with the community in a positive, forward-looking way, providing encouragement and support where necessary.</para><para>It is an honour for me have the opportunity to speak in the address-in-reply debate. I look forward to working with and for the people of the electorate of Canberra and working in this parliament in the hope that we can make a difference to the lives and fortunes of all in our community.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>176</page.no><name role="metadata">Moylan, Judi, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MOYLAN</name><name.id>4V5</name.id><electorate>Pearce</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a great pleasure to be here today to speak in the address-in-reply debate. In my fifth term in parliament, I still have the feeling of wonder that we are able to reinvent the process of democracy every three years—the apparent simplicity of it all, yet the sheer incredibility of it when one looks at how utterly few and endangered are the true democratic societies of our world. There are times when I wish that every person in the electorate of Pearce and beyond had the opportunity to visit this place and see the parliament in action. It is unfortunate that many see only glimpses on their television screen and the odd report in the daily paper. There is so much more to this parliament, and so much more that I think the Australian public could appreciate if they could share this experience with us.</para></talk.start><para>I am proud of the bipartisan work that is undertaken by the many committees of the parliament and the outstanding contributions of the men and women elected to office. These are men and women who represent broadly the electorates throughout Australia, 150 of them, notwithstanding their political differences. Whatever differences within our political alliances, we all regard the preservation of democracy as our first concern whenever it is threatened by the malevolent forces of fundamentalist extremism. As elected members we are well supported by the staff of Parliament House, an aspect that the public rarely gets to see. Hopefully there will be a growing awareness of the public operation of parliament through the great work of the House of Representatives Liaison and Projects Office, which has published some valuable material in recent times—including computer programs and CD-ROMs—to better inform schoolchildren and members of the public about the operation and work of this parliament. I thank and congratulate those within the parliamentary staff areas for this outstanding work. Thank you.</para><para>We have a system of government that serves us well. Many of us have watched the elections in Iraq and the courage of the Iraqi people going to the polls under such difficult circumstances. In fact my colleague here Joanna Gash went to Jordan and has been part of the process to ensure the success of the Iraqi elections. The election images beamed around the world should serve to strengthen our resolve—every one of us, whether we are members of parliament or members of the general public—to support our democratic processes and to participate fully to ensure the continuance of a strong democratic system of government. A democracy relies on not only members in this place representing their electorates but also the interaction of the Australian public with their members of parliament. Sometimes I hear from people that they do not see their member of parliament, but I always say to people, `This engagement is a two-way process.' There is an obligation on both parties, not just on members of parliament but also on members of the public, to come forward and discuss their concerns and to seek changes where those changes are appropriate. We must continue to strengthen our resolve in that regard, to have maximum participation by the Australian people in what goes on in this place. </para><para>This is also the first opportunity I have had since the federal election to place on record my appreciation to the many people who assisted me with the Pearce campaign, particularly Mr Lane Taylor, who took on the role of campaign chair as well as treasurer—a role that he has undertaken since my first campaign in 1992. That is participation and that is something to be proud of, and I am very grateful for that. He was ably supported by an excellent committee and by my staff. One is fortunate indeed to have the benefit of working with people who, with the same generosity of spirit and cheerful conviction that they have displayed in previous elections, are again committed so fully to participating in the democratic processes of our country. The electors of Pearce have once again elected me to represent them in the federal parliament, and I greatly appreciate the opportunity they have afforded me to ensure that their voices are heard in this place. I pledge myself to return to renew my energetic commitment to vigorous representation.</para><para>The Pearce electorate is a vast tract. It is the third-largest electorate in Western Australia and it includes outer suburban, rural and coastal communities with very diverse needs. The issues that are common to all include health, education, transport and telecommunications to name a few. I am grateful to our ministers in the respective portfolios for the consideration they have given to the electors of Pearce in the ongoing quest to improve these services. That said, I am very much aware that there is much more to be done. But the electorate has been well served by the legacy of over eight years of the Howard government. I will not go through all of these; I think they are fairly well understood. But economic growth has been made possible by these policies and certainly by financial deregulation and microeconomic reform, including important changes to the taxation system.</para><para>This has resulted in the benefit of economic growth and prosperity being shared amongst all Australians. That share has been very evenly distributed throughout the electorate according to the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling. They say that household income in the poorer suburbs and regions grew by 23.2 per cent, while the growth in income in the top-earning suburbs was negligibly higher at 24.2 per cent. The largest increase in household income was found in middle Australia, with a 28.9 per cent increase. So that puts paid to those who would criticise the Howard government for economic reform that delivers only to the rich. This has been a very significant contribution by the Howard government not only to ensure national prosperity but also to ensure that all members of the public benefit from that prosperity. Long may that continue.</para><para>These benefits are only possible with continuous economic reform. If we are to sustain the distribution of wealth throughout the community, we must continue down the path of reform in the future. There is no doubt about that. Some of these reforms include further reform to the taxation system. One of the things that deeply concerns me about the tax system today is that so few people understand it, even professionals. It is becoming more and more difficult. It has grown like topsy over the years and it is very hard for people to keep up with the rulings. The public have a right to expect that this parliament will deal with a reform of the tax system that allows average people to understand what their tax obligations are, and I do not think that is the case at the moment. </para><para>I do not think you will find too much disagreement anywhere that we pay too much tax, but that is always a balancing argument because our expectations are great. As long as we have great expectations of government to provide a variety of services then we will have to pay a reasonable amount of tax. I sometimes reflect on how many countries have the number of museums, theatres, libraries and other facilities that we have in Australia today. The infrastructure, which is really quite amazing for a large country, all has to be paid for. I guess the argument about the amount of taxation will be one that will be well and truly debated as the years go on.</para><para>The other area for reform is industrial relations. Having participated in the debate about the unfair dismissal laws and the attempts by the Howard government to change these laws on many occasions, I hope that commonsense will eventually prevail and that small business will be unburdened of what has been a very poor piece of legislation. It shows all the worst aspects of legislation: it was so heavily weighted against small business people, who are the primary employers of Australians in their small businesses. The last thing we want to do is discourage them from employing more people. There is always a balance to be had, but I believe that the legislation as it was before our attempts to amend it was highly prejudicial to the mums and dads in the community who run small businesses.</para><para>I also support the suggestion by the Prime Minister that we examine a single national industrial relations system and the simplification of the awards structure. Again, if we do not to take some of the worst aspects of industrial relations from our employer groups, then it is a great disincentive for businesses to grow and develop. It is a very costly system to the nation. So it has to be fair but it must also be streamlined so that you do not have the situation that exists today.</para><para>Certainly when doorknocking small businesses in my electorate over the past few weeks, I found deep concern in Western Australia about the push to bring back 24-hour trading. It is not that most business people are in essence opposed to 24-hour trading. The reason that those in Western Australia are concerned about it is the need for them to pay penalty rates to employees for working on Sunday or outside what are considered to be normal hours. This is a great difficulty for most small businesses. There is simply not the fat to be able to pay these kinds of penalty rates. The tragedy of it is that there are many people in our community today who want to work on Sundays and who want to take up part-time outside hours work. The industrial relations laws in Western Australia are a great impediment to small business supporting the competition policy requirement for 24-hour trading. Until the Western Australian state Labor government come to grips with that, they are going to continue to have resistance to a great degree from the Western Australian small business community. The fact is that by the time a small business pays penalty rates for a Sunday or outside hours there is no profit left from its opening. The current system is cumbersome and is certainly discouraging for many business owners. </para><para>The other area of continuing reform that interests me is education and training. I think the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, has provided outstanding leadership in education and training. He has done a great deal to provide solutions for many of the problems, particularly those to do with vocational training and apprenticeships, which have increased a lot. With full employment, we are seeing at the moment shortages in trade areas. Some measures have been put in place to address those, but I think we need to continue with that push because there is no doubt that future economic success is inextricably linked to having a ready and appropriately qualified work force. It is unacceptable to have the huge trade shortages that we have today with the potential to hobble many industries. Training is not just the responsibility of government though, and I want to stress this. Over the years we have seen many industries withdraw from training, relying on hiring companies to provide experienced labour for them. In an environment of rapid development and economic prosperity, this has led to a critical shortage of tradespeople across a wide area. I welcome particularly the announcements by Minister Nelson of the establishment of new training facilities. I know that work is progressing well on the implementation of this particular election commitment.</para><para>There are other areas of the social policy realm that I would like to see addressed. One of those is mental health. Sadly, we have seen the case of Cornelia Rau. What the case of Cornelia Rau has done though is highlight for both government and the Australian community that the issue of mental health is a very important and very pressing one within our community. Since the shift in policy to discourage institutionalising the mentally ill in our community, we have seen a steady number of homeless people at risk in a variety of ways as the system has failed to adequately support them. I know that the Commonwealth has been aware of the growing need for support in this area and that, through the National Mental Health Strategy, has responded with a steady increase in the amount of funding at a federal level for mental health services. The Commonwealth has contributed an increase of 128 per cent since 1993. Sadly, the states increased spending by a mere 40 per cent over the same period. Once again in mental health we are seeing a failure of consistency in approach to mental health services across the country. With a greater mobility of people, this demands a consistent approach to the delivery of services.</para><para>One of the other areas that has been of concern to me is that of unlawful arrivals in Australia. No-one can deny the terrible dilemma that faces modern governments today with an increasing number of refugees and displaced people looking for a better life outside their own countries, some of them whose lives depend on their escape from their own countries. A government has an obligation to its citizens though to have an orderly migration program and to play a role in taking legitimate refugees. As unpleasant as mandatory detention is, I cannot think of many options available to initially process people who arrive without appropriate entry visas. The responsibility of government is heightened by the events of 9/11 and the international environment in which we find ourselves in the 21st century.</para><para>I continue to be concerned about the lengthy time people are being held in detention before a determination is made. I remain particularly concerned about the effect of long detention periods on children, and I believe we should urgently establish an independent review process on how to shorten the period of mandatory detention and improve practices for dealing with unlawful arrivals. There are people who have been in detention centres since they were children. They have now become adults and remain in those centres. There are some who, as adults, have been in detention for in excess of six years. This is one of the policy areas that I personally am committed to seeing addressed in this term of parliament. </para><para> Aboriginal reconciliation and Aboriginal health remain issues for me. Listening to a radio program over the holiday, I was shocked and saddened by a report on Aboriginal returned servicemen. Apparently, they went unrecognised after returning from the war and most often died without recognition. They did not receive the same benefits as other returned servicemen. I did not know that and I was shocked to learn of it. In fact, a farmer and his wife from Western Australia spoke on the program and what they said was very touching. The program, though, offered a glimmer of hope with the restoration of the graves of Aboriginal ex-servicemen and the appropriate recognition on the headstone of service to their country.</para><para> It made me stop and think that this is just one of many injustices done to Aboriginal people, who were, after all, the first people of the land. It is a matter of enduring shame that so many Aboriginal people still live in circumstances long unacceptable to most of us. Practical reconciliation is an important part of dealing with the continuing poor state of Aboriginal health, housing and education; but it is not enough. Listening to the relatives of the Aboriginal servicemen in the radio program, I was touched by their humility and gratefulness in the face of  the awful neglect of men who should have been treated with dignity and respect and who have lain in unmarked graves until very recently.</para><para> We have inherited a bountiful, beautiful country without the awful violence that has marked the colonisation and settlement of other nations. This is in part I am certain due to the peaceful, sharing nature of Aboriginal people. Over the years we have jumped from being overpatronising to having little interest or support for the broader issues facing Aboriginal communities caught in the dilemma of preserving the remnants of an amazing culture with the need to engage with a contemporary world. However difficult that task may be and however uncomfortable we may feel, we owe our Aboriginal people more than practical reconciliation. There is a need for us to recognise the injustices and the ill-conceived policies, no matter how well meaning they were. Once we can accept and acknowledge this without compromise, then and only then can we walk hand in hand with our Aboriginal brothers and sisters to a better future. It requires humility. We must be able to acknowledge the injustices without equivocation. Further, we need to highlight the successes, for there are many within the Aboriginal communities, and to be optimistic and hopeful for a brighter future. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>180</page.no><name role="metadata">Corcoran, Ann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms CORCORAN</name><name.id>009CW</name.id><electorate>Isaacs</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are a number of issues I would like to speak about today in the address-in-reply of the Governor-General's speech. The first has to be to thank the electors of Isaacs for, once again, asking me to represent them here in Australia's parliament. To be elected to represent one's neighbours and fellow residents across, in my case, a number of suburbs is a great honour. I intend to continue to do all I can to represent the people of Isaacs as well as I can by being available to them as much as possible. For instance, I will be continuing my practice of conducting mobile offices in shopping centres outside office hours throughout the year and I will be continuing my program of doorknocking throughout the parliamentary term.</para></talk.start><para>I think that one of the risks of being elected to parliament is to get too involved in all the wonderful opportunities that present themselves outside the electorate and suddenly not have any time for the most important opportunity of all—that is, to hear what is going on in your own backyard. I intend to do all I can to make sure that I continue to remember the most important people: those whom I represent when I am in Canberra. </para><para>I am disappointed in the election result. I am pleased that I have been returned to parliament, but I wish that I had the company of a few more of my colleagues and that we were all sitting on the other side of the House. But the Australian people have spoken. We live in a democracy and we abide by the decision of the people despite personal feelings. The election just gone did not focus, as many experts predicted, on the war in Iraq, on refugees or even on national security. Despite the changed conditions in our world, grassroots issues and local worries took centre stage. Health and education were the issues most often raised with me during the election campaign period. The next group of issues most often raised with me were to do with the war in Iraq, our relationship with the US and the honesty of the current government.</para><para>But it is clear from the election results that the economy, or more accurately its effect on individual households, was the major issue in Isaacs. A decent life with a secure income—hopefully from a satisfying job—good affordable health care, access to excellent education, and respect for the physical environment and our neighbours, both local and global, should be features of our society. Many of Australia's policies in these areas have been the envy of many other countries, but I am afraid that much of this is about to disappear. In order to ensure that we continue in an effective society we, in this parliament, have an obligation to ensure that everyone is able to enjoy a decent life. We are all Australians and nobody has more of a claim than anybody else to a good way of life or a chance to enjoy life. In a fair and decent society, we will always make decisions that protect the weak—even to the disadvantage of the strong. A fair and decent society will ensure proper care of all its members whatever their strengths, weaknesses and capacities. It does not reward those who already have plenty at the expense of those who have less. A fair and decent society accepts and enjoys differences, and encourages and even demands tolerance.</para><para>The Speaker, in his first speech as the newly elected Speaker, reminded us that the eyes of the nation are on us as we go about our business here in parliament. The Speaker said:</para><quote><para>We all have a responsibility to repay the trust of our citizens by discharging our duties in a way worthy of respect.</para></quote><para>I have said before in this place that our behaviour, particularly in question time, is not always conducive to respect. It is clear to all of us here that question time is not typical of a parliamentary day, but that is not the perception of most Australians and of the people who speak to me. For most people, parliament is the bit of question time that they see on the nightly news when we are often engaged in behaviour in keeping with the rowdier elements of a football crowd when the umpire has made the wrong decision.</para><para>Parliament is one of our places of business and we are at work. We have been given the job of representing our constituency in federal parliament, making decisions that shape our nation and affect everyone's daily lives. The people of Australia deserve to feel assured that we are executing our jobs professionally and properly. I do not think the parliament that the public sees—that is, a bit of question time—offers anyone that reassurance. To my mind, it is most important that Australians have confidence in their MPs. It is important for a number of reasons: one of them being the ongoing health of our democracy. If people become disillusioned about our system of government, they will withdraw from it. </para><para>We are already seeing a significant number of voters who express absolute disinterest in voting. Recently there have been a few calls from government MPs and senators for the introduction of non-compulsory voting. Those calling for this change cite an increasing number of voters who say they are disinterested as a reason for that change. I guess their argument runs along the lines of: if a voter does not care or cannot be bothered why make them vote? But I argue that this is exactly what we should not do. We must address the don't care attitude, not accept it as unmovable. The don't care attitude is certainly not acceptable if we are at all interested in looking after our democracy. The suggestion that we move to non-compulsory voting is a step backwards, a step away from a strong democracy. Voting should be considered a responsibility not just a right. One thing that can be done immediately to redress this attitude of `why bother' is to polish up our image, particularly the way we behave in parliament. If we are seen to behave in a professional way then this is a good first step.</para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, it comes as no news to you that Labor has long been aware of the need to reform the health system. Presently something like $500 million per year is wasted because of the delineation between federal and state health systems. In particular, there are many frail and aged people in acute beds in public hospitals waiting for a bed in an aged care facility. This situation is distressing for older people and their families, frustrating for those trying to find beds for acute patients and a waste of our resources. I urge the government to adopt a policy similar to the one called Medicare Gold announced by Labor during the election campaign. The principle of Medicare Gold was excellent. It allows one level of government to fund the health and accommodation requirements of our aged and frail people, saving half a billion dollars a year and giving the aged the security of knowing that they will have access to appropriate and affordable health care when they need it.</para><para>The Howard government does not have a clear view of the real needs of Australians in the health field. Policy fixes and bandaids like MedicarePlus and the so-called Medicare safety net do little to instil confidence in those who need access to doctors and health professionals. The safety net will see the evolution of a two-tiered health system in Australia—the end to access to excellent and affordable health care regardless of who you are and the depths of your pocket. Medicare, and before it Medibank, has been the cornerstone of Australia's health system for a quarter of a century. A system that was once the envy of the world is being eroded by the short-sighted policies of the Howard government. The Prime Minister has never been a fan of Medicare. He has always wanted to demolish it and will now do so.</para><para>Labor want to strengthen Medicare and restore bulk-billing for all Australians. Labor are committed to restoring a national role for the provision of dental health to remove the unacceptable situation of many people who are waiting for a long time for essential dental care. We are committed to public funding for all listed vaccines—a policy which stands in stark contrast to the government's policy. The government's policy is one of only providing funding for recommended vaccines when shamed into it by the strength of public opinion, as evidenced last year in the pneumococcal vaccine debate.</para><para>One of what I call the `sleeping issues' is unemployment in the older work force, so-called mature age unemployment. A number of older men—and it is usually men—have recently told me about problems they experienced in finding a job. Often the person has been employed for most of his life and is now suddenly out of work because of redundancy or downsizing. These people often face a different set of problems to other unemployed people, but these problems are, nevertheless, just as important and need to be addressed. A typical case is a man in his late 40s or 50s, out of work often for the first time, often well qualified or skilled in his old job and often in a household where his partner works and has a reasonable income. The older unemployed person usually experiences the same feelings as other unemployed people do: loss of confidence, immense frustration at being unable to find work and a feeling of the world passing by and of suddenly being invisible. Add to this the frustration of not being eligible for assistance at Job Network because of a partner's income, and you end up with someone very frustrated and often angry—and with good cause. </para><para>I was delighted that the Labor Party's policies included specific plans to provide assistance to those mature age unemployed people. Labor's policy had a number of measures to assist older people who were out of work. One of those proposals was the establishment of mature age career centres. These centres would provide assistance and support targeted to mature age Australians out of work and would help them get back into work. The challenge for the government now is to take the necessary steps to look after these people and to ensure that their skills and experiences are not lost to the work force.</para><para>All we have had so far from the Howard government is a promise of a mature age worker tax offset. Workers over 55 who earn up to $48,000 a year will receive a $500-a-year tax break. I am not knocking the tax break for older workers, but it is hardly a policy to assist those out of work. This policy does nothing to address the generalisations and misconceptions about older workers, nor does it provide incentives for employers to retrain or hire older workers. The Governor-General has said that there are links between skills and achievements and a robust economy, yet the Howard government has few policies that address the difficulty older people have in finding employment. The truth is that, more than ever, the experience and knowledge of mature age workers is needed. With an ageing population, the need to recognise the skills and stability of mature workers is a necessity if we are all to use our resources to build a strong economy and support our ageing population.</para><para>As I said earlier, the economy was an important issue in the election campaign. People responded to the clever interest rate scare campaign. The fact that many people are so close to the edge financially is a direct result of the policies of this government over recent years. The government likes to claim credit for a good economy, yet many people no longer have the security of a reliable permanent job. Many people are living with what I have heard referred to as `a portfolio of jobs'. That is polite talk for someone trying to hold down a number of part-time or casual jobs, instead of having the comfort and security of one full-time permanent job.</para><para>In this strong economy I note that as a nation Australia is spending far more than it earns. Our current account deficit has hit record levels. We cannot continue along this path. The situation is unsustainable, yet we hear nothing from the government of plans to address this issue—sensible plans, that is.</para><para>What is unacceptable is for the Howard government to claim that they can control interest rates and that they are the only party that is economically responsible. History shows that, as Treasurer, John Howard presided over four consecutive budget deficits in the late seventies and early eighties. We hear about high interest rates under the Hawke government, but we do not hear about the fact that, when the coalition was tossed out in 1983, interest rates were around 16 per cent. They moved up and down over the next few years, peaking at 17 per cent, as we are so often reminded, before steadily falling to around seven per cent when Labor lost office in 1996. Since then interest rates have moved a bit and are now around 5½ per cent. </para><para>It is interesting too to look at Australia's interest rate history compared with rates in other countries. Australia's interest rates have always moved consistently with movements in other countries, the lesson being that interest rates are not under the direct control of government. Firstly, the Reserve Bank sets the interest rate and it is independent of the government. Secondly, Australia is part of a wider economy and our rates will move broadly with the fortunes or otherwise of like nations.</para><para>There is a shortage of skilled workers in Australia. Many people, including the Business Council of Australia, have been telling us this for some time. The response we now have from the government is to establish a few federally run technical colleges. There is no logic to this. We have a TAFE system in place which is crying out for more places so that it can meet the demand of students. We have industry crying out for more skilled workers. But the government takes the longwinded approach of developing another system on top of an existing one—a system which will take many years to produce graduates. This is a crazy solution to the problem. It is wasting the resources of our young people who today, right now, cannot get into TAFE. The challenge for the government is to abandon this crazy idea and fund places in the system that already exists and get on with training our young people, providing the skills that we need.</para><para>Another challenge the government must face in this term is the growing crisis in aged care. I have already talked a bit about the need to streamline the provision of aged care services, but there are other aspects to this issue. There is a shortage of places, exacerbated by the long lead times of bringing beds into operation once the bed licences have been issued. We have to get much better at providing an adequate number of beds, we have to get better at bringing them on line more quickly and we have to get better at providing the right mix of low- and high-level care beds.</para><para>Aged care operators in Isaacs tell me that, more and more, those entering the system for the first time are frailer and sicker than those entering the system for the first time a decade ago. This is probably a reflection of people's determination to stay at home as long as possible, coupled with better services provided to those at home. What it means for the aged care sector, though, is the need for a different mix of beds, more high-level beds, more services for those at home and more respite services to help the carers of those staying at home but needing day-to-day care.</para><para>The aged care sector also faces problems with staffing. Nurses in the aged care sector earn less than those in the acute sector, with the result that it is increasingly hard to attract and then keep staff in the aged care sector. Attention must also be paid to the question of adequate capital funding of aged care facilities. This does not mean bonds, but it does mean providing adequate funding so that aged care facilities can maintain decent physical facilities.</para><para>I have mentioned some of the challenges facing Australia. I have not talked about others such as the need for reform in the funding arrangements for schools, the need to provide for the thousands of people caring for frail relatives or disabled people, the need to improve at government level our attitude to our physical environment and to our Indigenous community, and our responsibilities in the global community. I will be doing all I can from this side of the House to keep the pressure on the government to attend properly to the challenges that this country and my electorate are facing. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>185</page.no><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TUCKEY</name><name.id>SJ4</name.id><electorate>O'Connor</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is with considerable pleasure, even at this late time and in this chamber, that I get my opportunity, in the address-in-reply debate, to respond to the Governor-General's speech. In looking to the document, I see a series of subheadings which are all-important to the interests of Australians. The first heading is `Maintaining a strong economy' and many of the other headings relate back to that commitment. I was somewhat disappointed, nevertheless, to find that throughout that series of commitments nothing was said about taxation reform. Taxation reform does not necessarily mean tax cuts. There is a great old statement about taxation. The perfect tax requires simplicity, equity and certainty—or it might be the other way around: simplicity, certainty and equity. I do not think the Australian tax system at state, local or Commonwealth level meets any of those criteria. It is a challenge to this parliament—not this government—to address those principles and see what we can do about a stack of paperwork and all the tragedies that are brought to our attention as people spend half their business life or their personal life trying to reduce the burden arising, in the case of personal taxation, from bracket creep in particular.</para></talk.start><para>I thought it would be a good opportunity to put on the record just a few facts that I obtained in trying to address these principles myself. The advice I received is very interesting. I asked this question of the Library—who gave me this information from the statistics; it is not their view: how many taxpayers have a gross income below $6,000, below $10,000 and below $15,000? The latest statistics—which, I might add, are from 2001-02—are that there are 10,343,677 taxpayers and, of these, 1.7335 million, or 16.8 per cent, had total incomes of less than $10,000 and 2.7 million, in round figures, or 26.1 per cent, had total incomes of less than $15,000. There are no published figures on my other question.</para><para>Then I asked: how much government revenue would be received if all income earners above $10,000 were taxed from the first dollar at 17c or 10c, but all under $10,000 paid nothing? In other words, you paid on all your income if you earned more than $10,000. It was estimated that for 2004-05 if those individuals with taxable income of less than $10,001 paid no tax and all other taxable individuals paid 10 per cent, the additional revenue would be $3.1 billion. If we made it 17 per cent, the additional revenue would be $9.1 billion.</para><para>I also asked how much revenue we receive in the various categories of taxation—that is, the 17 per cent rate, the 30 per cent rate, the 42 per cent rate and the 47 per cent rate. It is interesting to note that, presently, the 17 per cent rate delivers 22 per cent of the total tax collected; the 30 per cent rate, 44 per cent of the total tax collected; the 42 per cent rate, seven per cent of the total tax collected; and the 47 per cent rate, 26 per cent of the total tax collected. That is a huge burden because, even on the proposed future brackets, too many Australians are moving into the two higher brackets, 42 and 47 per cent, and they do not equate with the company tax rate, which is 30 per cent. So what do people do? They waste the time of their accountants, who should be telling them how to run their business—and this is even at the corporate level—trying to find ways to escape that problem. We have all heard of the family trust and the associated company arrangements that have to be put in place. Having been in that field for years as a business man, and then moving to this parliament, where I wished to extricate myself from a lot of those arrangements, I discovered just how difficult that was and what a mess it had created in our financial dealings as a family. </para><para>Why do we do it? As Terry McCrann quite properly told us in an article the other day, we are all rich people seeking to distribute or claim as many $6,000 tax-free thresholds as we can. If we had to pay tax from the first dollar that would not be an option, and therefore the interest in a lot of those complex arrangements would disappear overnight. Of course this issue could be addressed, as I have pointed out, simply by saying nobody pays tax if they earn less than $10,000. That is a fairly generous arrangement for the 17 per cent who are in that category. At the same time, those people who earn greater amounts would start paying with the first dollar, and if that were 17 per cent we would find that the $9.1 billion of revenue would be fairly close to the $13 billion of revenue the government would lose if it discontinued the 42 per cent and 47 per cent tax rates. That is not perfect, but I guess it addresses the simplicity argument. Someone might say I am simple to even put it up, but too many people are making money out of the complexity, and I think that is a great pity. It just brings to our attention better ways perhaps of achieving those three criteria.</para><para>Let us look at where the money is spent and how it is raised through other avenues. State revenue, according to the advice I have received, is about $75 billion. Do not think this is going to happen tomorrow, because much more powerful people in my party make these decisions, but I asked a question as to what would happen if GST were applied to all transactions without exemption and the rate was five per cent, 10 per cent and 12 per cent. I am told that at five per cent the revenue would be $21.2 billion; at 10 per cent, $42.4 billion; and at 12 per cent, $50.9 billion—and maybe I should have asked what the revenue would be at 15 per cent.</para><para>GST revenue in the year 2003-04 was $33 billion, with our highly complex arrangements. So we have states expending $75 billion with all their nasty taxes—and I want to refer to them, but they are not their fault. On extrapolating those figures, the total state revenue of $75 billion could probably be met with a 15 per cent GST rate. They could get rid of payroll tax, stamp duty and all those things, other than in my mind a fee relative to the actual service provided. That is how stamp duty started: it was a fee to record your property transaction—and that was quite appropriate, but it converted to a revenue measure over time.</para><para>In looking at this you would immediately say: `What about the poor people? They'd have to pay 15 per cent on a lettuce; isn't that terrible?' But the average Australian moves house every seven years. Even for a modest residence today the stamp duty would be $10,000 or $12,000. Divide that by seven and that is over $1,500 a year in personal tax, but nobody thinks about it in that context. Of course, if they buy a new car every three years, they would need to pay another $1,000 or whatever in state stamp duty. So wouldn't they possibly be better off paying 15 per cent on a lettuce—that is a question, not a statement—instead of those other taxes and payroll tax?</para><para>If you think there is no payroll tax on a tin of beans, think again. There is no such thing as a free lunch. To make a profit, a business that is paying payroll tax must pass it on to the consumer. Of course we know the detriments that that tax has in terms of its complexity and the employment decisions of employers et cetera. If they are an exporter then that is a burden they carry when they are competing in the real world with other countries that have different forms of taxation. So would it be better to have a GST that does not tax exports as the sole means of state revenue?</para><para>These are the sorts of figures that I think can be talked about. They do not involve any substantial reduction in the overall tax burden, but certainly there would be some shifting. Nevertheless, I do not see why Wilson Tuckey or Kerry Packer need $6,000 of their income tax free. I think that, even on our rather poor salaries, we would be better off paying 17c on $6,000 than 47c on $20,000 or $30,000 or whatever it is. There would be benefits. </para><para>There are shearers working in my electorate who refuse to shear more than 150 sheep a day. Some of them can shear 200 sheep, but they say, `I'm not going to sheer the last 50 sheep for the taxman.' So what happens? The shearing period gets extended and everybody—the contractor, the farmer and eventually the consumer—has to pay the shed hands for a couple of extra days to get the job finished. That is not necessarily good for anyone. So there are a lot of disincentives in those high tax rates.</para><para>I argue very strongly that the top personal tax rate should always be harmonised with the company tax rate, whatever it is. All the schemes that cause people pain, and the fights that follow with the Taxation Commissioner, would suddenly cease. Nevertheless, in terms of the administration of the tax act, I have never been able to understand why we as a parliament have not promoted a simple law which says that, if a taxpayer makes a full disclosure to the ATO which is later disputed by the Taxation Commissioner—and that is fair enough—any penalties or interest should only apply, say, 60 days after the Taxation Commissioner notifies the taxpayer that he disagrees with their personal calculation of how much tax they owe. I cannot see how people can go for three or four years making certain claims and then get a letter in the mail from the Taxation Commissioner which says: `Three or four years ago you did something with which I now disagree. I am therefore hitting you with heavy penalties and interest charges over that period.' That often puts people in a position where they go broke. I cannot understand how there is any certainty, simplicity or, more particularly, equity in that arrangement.</para><para>I believe that our parliament should say it is a fundamental rule that, until the Taxation Commissioner tells you he disagrees, you cannot be hit with penalties or interest for that period. It should be up to the Taxation Commissioner. As they once did, he can look at your tax return and write to you the following day. The rule is that you should make full disclosure and not tell untruths. So if you say, `I earned all this money and I entered scheme X and I believe that entitled me to reduce my tax by Y,' I see no reason whatsoever why, in those circumstances, you should be penalised until the Taxation Commissioner disagrees.</para><para>I put those few figures on the record for people to consider. We probably should sit down as a parliament and come up with alternatives of that nature. But my target is the removal of tax avoidance. I think the $6,000 tax-free threshold is much more beneficial to high-income earners than low-income earners. I really do. I think we need to have a better approach to that, notwithstanding that low-income earners are not expected to pay tax at the same rate as people in higher income categories. Having said that, I hope the parliament will see in the next three years a major approach to this from both sides.</para><para>I have sat through 13 years of opposition in this place. And I made the point yesterday that the Prime Minister has given credit to Bob Hawke, in particular, for the reforms that passed through this parliament during the Hawke government—when Keating was Treasurer—and the Keating government. Most of them got through the caucus because Keating or Hawke were able to go to the caucus and say, `You'll get no trouble from the coalition opposition on this issue.' I sat there in the shadow cabinet for years judging new policy announcements. When Keating came up with his GST we did not knock it. The trade unions knocked it, but we did not. They pulled the rug out from under him. As I recollect, it was all decided in a motel room. But the reality is that we said it was a positive measure. </para><para>A great challenge to the Labor Party and its new leader is to look at things and analyse them for the benefit of Australia, not for whether they are going to win or lose the next election. I think Aussies have gone well past the gravy train, notwithstanding we all still ride it. Australians are a lot more analytical and they want to see members of parliament get together on good issues, not running scare campaigns just because they sound good, not surfing to re-election on a tax that the community has now accepted and that might be the better source of 100 per cent of state revenues if we got rid of all those other taxes. Who stops to think that their house costs them $1,500 a year in stamp duty? That is about 30 bucks a week. Nobody thinks of it but that is what it is statistically. Of course it has even been a threat to the building industry at times because people have stood back and said, `I can't afford to buy a new house because I can't afford to sell the old one,' and that is a problem because we want people to buy new houses. It is good for the economy.</para><para>Because there is no such thing as a free lunch, I constantly remind people that with some deregulation of the labour market there has been a very substantial increase in the buying power of the average wage earner. Money? As we all know, at times during the Weimar Republic you needed a wheelbarrow to take enough money to buy a loaf of bread. Dollars? Not worth anything, more particularly if the tax man is the biggest beneficiary. But the fact of life is that, under the Howard government, workers' buying power has gone up by about 13 per cent. That statistically compares to two per cent over 13 years of the Hawke government and the Accord. Why? Because the Accord kept providing more cash but it did not provide the offsets in productivity that meant that Mrs Worker could buy things at a competitive price. The Chinese have fixed that up, and it is now a fact that children's clothing is cheaper than when I was clothing my children 40 years ago. Certainly in real terms it is much cheaper. That is as good as a pay increase.</para><para>We have to look at it in this way. It is no good going out there and saying, `Now is the time to grab a heap of dollars,' if it puts up our taxes, puts up costs to employers and eventually puts up the prices in supermarkets. But I do not think the world is ever going to let us get away with that again. Free markets are a given and they are happening here in Australia. Of course, most of the time the beneficiary is the consumer, and that is a good thing. So we have to win and maintain our living standard in two areas. We want good government—and I think the infrastructure argument is very important.</para><para>I have spent a lot of time on tax now and I will not get to the other things I wanted to say, but we are going to have to make hydrogen in this country and fuel all our vehicles with it. We can make it all from renewable energy. My farmers can make enough of it from the sun to use on their farms. We can use the tides of the Kimberleys, and I invite the Labor opposition to give my mob a touch up and say you will do it. Colin Barnett has grabbed the political initiative in WA by saying that he will bring water down from the north and he does not care what it costs. People are interested in those things. We have enough energy in the tides of the Kimberleys, otherwise unusable, to liquefy hydrogen, put it in a ship like we do with natural gas—there is no rocket science involved—and ship it to Sydney. General Motors told us in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on the 19th of last month that they will be selling hydrogen cars in 2010. </para><para>We have got three buses running around Perth doing a wonderful job, and all that comes out of their exhaust pipes is steam. They are the only three in the Southern Hemisphere. It is a wonderful example of what we can do; we should be planning for that together. It is no good saying you are going to have hydrogen cars and then burn coal to electrolyse the water to make it. Let the coal industry generate the 50 per cent of energy needed for electricity—that is convenient and cheap. Let us put all our wheels under hydrogen, and 50 per cent of our energy consumption will be clean and can be generated by renewable resources. As I said, I should have allowed more time for this issue. They are all interesting issues. If we get those things right as a parliament, the community will be eternally grateful.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>189</page.no><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Welcome back to the Speaker's panel, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick. It is really good to see you presiding over the affairs of the Main Committee this morning. In my contribution to the address-in-reply debate I want to discuss an issue that has been neglected by the Prime Minister as well as the Governor-General in his remarks at the opening of this parliament. It is the issue of increasing poverty in Australia and the increasing inequality that we are seeing between the haves and the have-nots. It is true that the Prime Minister has nominated reform of the industrial relations system and welfare reform as the big ticket items for his fourth term of office. Yet I am surprised by the continuing silence of the Prime Minister, and the Governor-General in his address, about what I see as one of the nation's biggest problems—that is, poverty and growing inequality.</para></talk.start><para>The Prime Minister would be well advised to take a leaf out of Nelson Mandela's book. In addressing a recent mass rally in London, which was focusing on the very critical issue of global poverty, Nelson Mandela had this to say:</para><quote><para>Like slavery and apartheid, poverty is not natural. It is man-made and it can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings.</para><para>And Overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity ... It is the protection of a fundamental human right, the right to dignity and a decent life.</para></quote><para>If our Prime Minister was really serious about improving the wellbeing of people in our community, he would elevate these two issues to the forefront of public policy debate and action in this country. In so doing he could really make a difference to the lot of many in our community who are witnessing the steady erosion of the notion of a fair go. We often hear Australia spoken of as a land of great opportunity with Australians enjoying a high standard of living and wellbeing. This is becoming increasingly true only for the majority in our country as a disturbingly high and growing number of people in our midst are living in poverty and denied the opportunities that come with economic and social wellbeing.</para><para>While financial hardship is the most obvious dimension of poverty, and usually the criteria that is used to define what we understand as the poverty line in this nation, people who live in relative poverty also lack the resources required for them to participate as full members of our society. The 2004 comprehensive Senate inquiry into poverty and financial hardship examined a number of ways of measuring poverty and concluded that there is:</para><quote><para>... a consensus that the numbers of Australians living in poverty generally ranges from 2 to 3.5 million ...</para></quote><para>So the strong economic gains that we hear so much about from the Prime Minister and from the government, particularly in contributions in the House and in the Governor-General's opening address, have not been fairly shared by all our citizens. </para><para>While our economic indicators have continued to reach upwards, so has the level of inequality, poverty, homelessness, long-term unemployment, suicide and child abuse. Clearly something is going drastically wrong. The current levels of poverty in a country as rich as ours is quite unacceptable. There is, as people have described it, a blindness of affluence that affects our public debate, for it is largely the people reaping the benefits of economic growth who are also analysing and writing about national issues and setting the agenda. Those who are falling by the wayside regrettably have little voice to articulate the issues of concern to them and their communities. The Howard government continues to turn a blind eye to these problems. It has no strategy to tackle poverty and inequality in our society. In fact the government is abrogating its responsibility to tackle this great indignity.</para><para>While people can argue about what level is appropriate for setting the poverty line—some people argue it should be based on average wages or median wages—they all agree, and there can be no denying, that poverty is growing and that there are numerous deprivations that come with being poor. The Senate report to which I referred documents the close association between poverty and inequality of opportunity and reveals that the disadvantage in our nation is increasingly concentrated and geographic in its manifestations. I refer to a number of key indicators of poverty and inequality. These include the statistic that I referred to earlier—that between two million and 3½ million Australians today are living in poverty and that number has increased under the Howard government's stewardship. Today, around 700,000 children are growing up in households in Australia in which neither parent works. The number of working poor is on the increase, with nearly one million working families not earning enough to lift them above the poverty line. While one-tenth of Australian households now own 45 per cent of our wealth, half the number of households in Australia own only seven per cent. Surely this reveals the extent of inequality in our midst.</para><para>As we all know, poverty is associated with poorer health outcomes, behavioural difficulties, low educational attainment, juvenile offending, social isolation and lack of support. Very disturbingly, intergenerational poverty is becoming a growing reality for a significant number of Australian families, some of whom live in my electorate. Voluntary and church organisations throughout the length and breadth of Australia continue to report a large growth in the number of people accessing their services and coming to them for emergency relief and assistance. The harsh reality of the situation in Australia was reinforced in a recently released UN human development index in 2004. It showed what we all know—that Australia was performing very well in terms of economic targets. It showed Australia's economic growth helped rank us third in the highly developed world for our human development but, at the same time, Australia was among the worst performers when it came to poverty. Australia was placed fourth on the human poverty index, with the United States, not surprisingly, the worst performer.</para><para>Added to this national dimension of poverty and inequality is a new phenomenon that is developing, one that is referred to as `postcode poverty'. In a recent study by the Ignatius Centre released last year, titled Community Adversity and Resilience, the centre measured the concentration of disadvantage according to postcode areas in New South Wales and Victoria. I took a particular interest in the findings of this report, for among the 40 highest ranking New South Wales postcode areas on a general disadvantage factor were three postcodes in my electorate of Throsby—the postcodes covering the suburbs around Warrawong, Berkeley and Port Kembla. Let me say a little about these areas. </para><para>In the suburbs that I have mentioned the median individual income, according to the most recent census data, is between $233 and $263 per week. The median family income is in the range of $435 to $550. In one area alone, the unemployment rate is recorded as being 20.2 per cent. In my electorate of Throsby, 22 per cent of children aged under 15 now live in families where no person is employed. These are real people, not just statistics. We need to deal with the problems that automatically arise—the fact that 7,000 children in my electorate are today growing up in homes where no-one has a connection with paid employment.</para><para>Naturally I was very interested in examining the conclusions of the study and what suggestions the Ignatius Centre, in its report, made for future policy and action. I want to point to a few of them. The study found that in Australia we are now witnessing growing areas of entrenched social disadvantage and intergenerational poverty that is related to where one lives, hence the term `postcode poverty'. It showed quite clearly that social exclusion breeds social alienation and the social problems that come with it. But, interestingly enough, the study also found that communities that can score highly on the measure of social cohesion seem to cope considerably better in the face of unemployment, low family income, low occupational skills and limited education. The study found that the causes and potential remedies of social disadvantage are located at many levels. The research paper goes on to argue:</para><quote><para>Without diminishing in any way the importance of macroeconomic factors to the economic and social health of a neighbourhood, the findings are a reminder that a community's internal relations can also play a significant part in shaping its wellbeing.</para></quote><para>Following from this the authors argue:</para><quote><para>... strengthening the connectedness or social cohesion of disadvantaged areas is an integral part of renewing the life opportunities of people.</para></quote><para>So I think we can say with some degree of certainty that some communities facing and burdened by disadvantage appear more resilient than others in overcoming adversity and making the most of opportunities that come along.</para><para>These research findings would have very important implications for government policy and strategies for dealing with poverty if there were the political will to take them up. In particular, this study shows, firstly, that we need locality-specific measures to supplement general policy initiatives in dealing with disadvantage and poverty. Secondly, the study shows that there needs to be a redefinition of the relationship between communities and government agencies. In other words, this involves a different way of agencies working with communities. What seems very central is the need to build a sense of partnership with the community and to build a sense of commitment and community ownership.</para><para>When disadvantage has become entrenched in a community over many years—or even over decades—as it has in parts of my electorate, governments need to understand that matters cannot be put right within a yearly or three-yearly funding cycle. I had reason to write recently to the Minister for Family and Community Services on behalf of a number of local projects that were facing the end of their funding rounds. One in particular, the Bundaleer project run by Barnardos, is doing some magnificent work on a public housing estate in my electorate. Yet no sooner had the first funding round been put into place, with a community development officer and really good positive outcomes being achieved, than they found that the guidelines for the next round of funding had changed—and the all too frequent cycle of applying and waiting for approval from government befell that project. I want to reinforce again the point that if you want to see good outcomes then you have to understand that you will not overcome intergenerational poverty with a funding grant of a year or, at best, three years. We need governments to work in a more holistic way with the communities, building their own self-confidence and community capacity. </para><para>There is a clear message in the findings of this important research that the Howard government should be acknowledging and heeding. The authors said:</para><quote><para>If for the first time in Australia's history, one's destiny might be shaped by one's location, or even one's postcode—</para></quote><para>whether that be an urban, regional or remote community—</para><quote><para>it might be time to rethink some of the rules of the game.</para></quote><para>I do not think the argument could be put more succinctly.</para><para>The recent Senate inquiry into poverty both heard and documented an enormous range of stories about the impact of poverty on our community. Through many submissions a number of important messages came through. Firstly, poverty is not just about disadvantage and financial hardship; it is also about exclusion and lack of opportunity and choice. Secondly and very importantly, tackling poverty requires leadership by the national government and a strategy involving all levels of government working in partnership with a range of business and community organisations. I would argue that it is not too late for the Howard government to address this problem, but it does require political will and acknowledgement of growing inequality and poverty at a time of relative economic prosperity. In the chamber we often hear both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister talking up the economic outcomes. There is no doubt that, relative to other advanced economies, Australia is faring very well, although a number of worrying signs are beginning to emerge. But we never hear the same government talk about this underlying problem, because this government is also afflicted by the `blindness of affluence'. It does not really see and does not really appreciate what it is like to be living in one of these very disadvantaged communities.</para><para>We need a national strategy initiated by the government, complete with performance targets for poverty alleviation. That call has been made widely by a number of church and welfare organisations as well. This is precisely what occurred in Ireland with their adoption of a national antipoverty strategy. The Irish government aims to combat poverty in the medium to long term and develop an explicit definition of poverty and an understanding of the causes of poverty and social exclusion. In Britain, the SureStart early intervention program is now operating in 500 disadvantaged neighbourhoods, providing a more holistic approach and response to these issues.</para><para>I urge the government to act on a national antipoverty plan if it is really serious about producing positive outcomes for our community in this term of office. In my view, such a plan would result in far more beneficial outcomes for a wider group of people than the ideologically driven industrial relations and welfare reforms that the Howard government is intent on pursuing. I believe that, in this ideologically driven quest to change the industrial relations system, the people that I have been talking about today, who are very much the victims of poverty and inequality, will be further disadvantaged by the deregulation of the existing protections that we find in our industrial relations system. We can only add to the growing numbers of working poor and those living in poverty by having an agenda that tries to dismantle the protections that have been in place for a long time to look after the needs and interests of those with little bargaining power in the work force. </para><para>Similarly, I am very concerned, on behalf of the great numbers of people on the disability support pension in my electorate, that the reforms in this area are going to force the many people finding it hard to make ends meet into even more precarious situations in the future. So while we can all take heart from some of the very good economic outcomes that we have seen over the last couple of decades, many of them put into place by the reforms undertaken by earlier Labor governments, I think it is time that the Howard government acknowledged that, despite our economic gains, there are increasing numbers of Australians living in poverty. It is a major national issue. Inequality in our society is growing, and the time has come for the government to take some national action on this issue, because it does require political will, not what we are seeing: turning of a blind eye to the poverty that exists in our communities.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>193</page.no><name role="metadata">Entsch, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ENTSCH</name><name.id>7K6</name.id><electorate>Leichhardt</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a great pleasure for me to participate today in this address-in-reply debate. I am certainly proud to stand here as the federal member for Leichhardt for the fourth time and, along with my colleague the member for Deakin, as part of the fourth Howard government. The Australian public has again given this government a clear mandate: continue with our policies and keep this country very strong economically and of course safe from terrorism. I believe the Howard government won its fourth term so convincingly because of its outstanding record in keeping our nation's economy thriving, and I was glad to see the member for Throsby actually acknowledging the strength of the economy at the moment.</para></talk.start><para>Despite economic troubles around the world, Australia has managed to continue to prosper, maintaining low unemployment and record low interest rates and continuing to reduce government debt. Our country remains the best-performing nation in the OECD. Our budget surplus of $8 billion in 2003-04—$3.5 billion higher than estimated at the time of the 2004-05 budget—again reflects the strength of the economy. The $96 billion debt that we inherited in 1996 has now been slashed to below $26 billion. That is a huge saving that we are generating in funds that it is not necessary to pay as the interest on that debt. Our unemployment rate as of only yesterday is 5.1 per cent nationally—the lowest in over 30 years—which is an outstanding performance. In Cairns, in my region, the unemployment rate has dropped to 4.7 per cent. Again, this is an outstanding statistic.</para><para>This last election brought many successes to my electorate, including ongoing funding for stage 3 of the development of the Cairns esplanade. There is $10 million to continue the boardwalk towards the international airport, $11.4 million for the Daintree rainforest and wet tropics, $5 million for the Daintree Coast Conservation Initiative, $1 million for further protection of the endangered cassowary and $5.4 million from the Natural Heritage Trust to help manage the wet tropics. There was also $40 million set aside to establish a marine and tropical research centre at James Cook University, to support very important research relating to the Great Barrier Reef and the tropical rainforest. At this stage, I would like to say a special thanks to Russell Reichelt from the CRC Reef Research Centre, John McIntyre from TTNQ and Daniel Gschwind, the Chief Executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council, who worked very closely with me in securing this funding. This came about after the CRC for Reef Research and the CRC for Rainforest Futures were unsuccessful in their bids for ongoing funding. </para><para>There were many who were critical of government for not allowing that funding to continue, even though both bids clearly did not meet the criteria under the CRC guidelines. These three people realised that immediately and were prepared to come in and work very closely with me and, as a direct result of their endeavours, we now have a new $100 million program that is directly focused on public good CRC endeavours that have an environment focus. They are taken out of the normal CRC process. The first $40 million goes to its establishment. So to those three gentlemen I say, `Excellent work'.</para><para>We are starting to see the first of our young doctors being trained at James Cook University, through a medical facility that this government established some years ago. We are now taking the next step, with another $12 million committed to a new veterinary science facility at James Cook University to be established in Townsville and with links to the Cairns campus. It will focus on tropical agriculture. What is even more important and more significant for regional areas is that it is looking at establishing a satellite facility at Malanda, in the tablelands, for large animals and tropical agriculture. This new facility will provide a unique focus on tropical animal husbandry and diseases in tropical agriculture.</para><para>There is also $6 million over four years to provide 50 new veterinary science places in 2006, rising to 137 in 2009. This is going to provide some outstanding opportunities not only for young people interested in studying veterinary science in our region but also for students from the South-East Asian region who want to study. They will be able to contribute to our community and study in Far North Queensland. It is a great benefit for our region to get more and more foreign students accessing our facilities, paying full fees and bringing the additional resources for accommodation and other living costs that they distribute around our community while they are there.</para><para>There was also $6 million towards the Great Green Way project, a tourist initiative linking Townsville to Cairns. The tourism industry in Far North Queensland already employs some 12,000 people. Tourism initiatives are vitally important, with 16.4 per cent of the total Far North Queensland work force being employed in tourism. With the Great Green Way initiative, we will see these figures start to grow. The tourism industry provides some 40 per cent of our income in Far North Queensland. You can see how important that industry is to us.</para><para>On the education side, there have also been some great initiatives welcomed in my electorate, with the government boosting training in areas of skill shortages through packages designed to encourage more young people to take up trades. While Minister Nelson was in my region, he announced that the $800 tool kit for new apprentices and the living away from home allowance will be extended to third-year apprentices. These are absolutely vital for young people in my area, given that a lot of them come down from the Torres Strait, Cape York and remote areas. To get extra financial support while living away from home provides an additional incentive for apprentices to finish their training.</para><para>One of the 24 Australian technical colleges to be established will be in Townsville, which will be great and certainly something we can access. I am certainly looking forward to seeing these colleges as they are rolled out. Once these 24 colleges have been established, I will certainly be putting in a bid for a 25th, hopefully in Cairns. The government commitment to direct funds for infrastructure through the P&amp;Cs is a great way to fund schools, to stop cost shifting in state governments, allowing for the refurbishment of classrooms, the installation of airconditioning, the upgrade of tuckshop facilities et cetera, and will give the parents of children attending these schools a much greater say, assisting them in raising funds for particular initiatives. It would have been of particular benefit to the school community in Cairns North, one of the oldest schools in Cairns, that had been run down appallingly. However, the Beattie Labor government decided to shut the school down on 10 December, to sell it off to developers for housing or some other real estate venture, rather than allow it to continue as an educational facility—a bitter disappointment for many of the parents of children who attended that school. </para><para>When you come from a regional area you cannot make any comment in this place without raising the issue of roads. I think that the government's $12.5 billion land transport initiative through AusLink is outstanding. Leichhardt is certainly going to be a significant benefactor of that initiative. Initially none of the money allocated to Queensland was to be set aside for flood-proofing a particularly difficult area south of Cairns on the Bruce Highway at Tully. Unfortunately, the state government saw this as a low priority and suggested that it was part of an eight-year plan. We disagreed and, with some outstanding support from the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Mr Lloyd, we were able to quarantine $80-odd million from Queensland for the upgrading of that area.</para><para>When that road is flooded and the road transporters stop, it has an impact on all communities north of Tully, not only from a tourism perspective but also from a supply perspective. It is an almost annual event. We thought the $80 million might have fixed the problem, because the state government suggested that was what it would cost, but after we allocated the money we found they had done no planning whatsoever. We then had to supply another $1½ million to the state government and ask that they initiate a plan immediately so we could get the thing started. Rather than the three years that they were suggesting, we encouraged them to get the plan done in 12 months.</para><para>Again, I thought that would have been the end of the issue but, unfortunately, when dealing with Mr Beattie and his Labor government you have to get used to surprises. After all this had taken place we found out that he had decided not to go ahead with this because he does not want to sign up to our national building code. He has decided that the community of Tully and communities further north are secondary, in his consideration, to making sure that he does not offend the unions on issues such as right of access to the road construction site, union membership et cetera.</para><para>The situation has reached something of a stalemate now, but I am hoping that Mr Beattie will take some leadership from South Australia and, as of yesterday, from Victoria. The Victorian government have signed up to the national code. I now hope that Queensland will be the third government to sign up so that construction of this road can commence. It is vital infrastructure. The Queensland government cannot afford to start playing around and engaging in this sort of nonsense. I call on Mr Beattie to sign up and get the money flowing without any further delay.</para><para>Some $30 million has been spent on our Southern Access Road. The recent three-laning of the area between the Sheehy and Foster roads was completed just before Christmas. However, I am disturbed that the federal department of transport advises me that there have been no further submissions for ongoing work in that area. It is a stop and start situation where people are continually being inconvenienced rather than having continuity of flow in getting the job finished. I am already pursuing the Queensland Department of Main Roads and saying: `Get out there and have a look at it. Have a bit of vision. Think towards tomorrow. Don't wait until the problem is upon us and then blame the federal government for not fixing it. Get it up front so that we can get the resources to get the job finished.' </para><para>I was also very pleased to receive confirmation of funding for the Peninsula Development Road. Maintaining that as a road of national importance is vital for the Cape York community. While some $5 million has already been allocated to that road as the federal government's contribution, I would encourage the state government to consider continuing the upgrading of that highway and committing more resources to it. The Australian government, through the Roads of National Importance program, will contribute 50 per cent to all ongoing projects, so I ask them to continue to plan for the future, thinking of the needs of the Cape York residents.</para><para>The allocation of $500,000 to Russett Park residents for flood-proofing was welcomed by the community. The Mareeba Shire Council have stepped up to the plate and have put their $500,000 on the table. The only one that is not prepared to contribute is, again, the Beattie Labor government. The community are absolutely outraged, as are the council. I can assure you that, after all the work that we have put in, I am very angry that the state government is still reluctant to contribute. We have not lost a life this year. We nearly lost one last year and the year before that. I think we have lost two lives so far—the lives of people trying to cross that road in a flood. It is vital that the state Labor government steps up and meets its commitments. I have to say that funding for the Black Spot and Roads to Recovery programs has been outstanding in my electorate. I look forward to both those programs continuing because they are of immense benefit.</para><para>The government is certainly going to pursue its longstanding policy on the full sale of Telstra. I totally support that policy. We came to government in 1996, and 90 per cent of people in my electorate now have access to mobile phone coverage, internet and a whole range of services that they could only have dreamt of. We have recently extended mobile phone coverage to places as remote as Badu Island, Sabai Island and Murray Island in the middle of the Torres Strait. Sabai is within three kilometres of mainland Papua New Guinea and they can now talk on a mobile phone—something that could never have been dreamt of a few years ago. There has been a huge benefit, as there has been with the extension of television and radio right through these areas which a couple of years ago could only dream of having those services available to them.</para><para>There were a lot of initiatives in the last budget in relation to families, carers and women. There have also been huge initiatives in relation to health. There was the increase in the rebate for GP consultations from 85 to 100 per cent and a number of other initiatives. In mental health, some $50 million will be provided over four years to provide assistance to GPs in the detection of depression. There is some $30 million for better outcomes for mental health care initiatives and some $30 million for beyondblue, a national, independent not-for-profit organisation which addresses the issue of depression. I think the events of the last week or so highlight the desperate need for further mental health initiatives. This funding will certainly start to address some of these issues, but I think a lot more has to be done in this area. I hope the outcome of the inquiry into this recent event will be a catalyst for both the states and the Australian government to start to look at greater investment in what I believe is an area of absolutely desperate need: mental health and, in particular, schizophrenia. I hope that some positives start to come out of this inquiry. It has certainly highlighted the shortfall. </para><para>In July we will, of course, see the abolition of ATSIC. Given that I have in my electorate the third largest Indigenous population in Australia, I can tell you that the overwhelming majority of Indigenous people on the ground and in remote communities are watching the clock and waiting for the day. They just cannot wait for it to come. It cannot come quickly enough.</para><para>I would like to finish by having a look at some of the initiatives that were proposed by the Labor Party at the last election. The Labor Party are wondering why they lost—and lost so soundly. You only have to have a look at their policies in Cape York. They are now talking about locking up the cape. They are talking about restricting economic opportunities. They signalled that they would be cutting legal assistance for Cape York farmers, fishers and miners engaged in native title disputes and throw the whole native title system into doubt. Their environmental policies were clearly designed to win votes.</para><para>The ideologists in the latte set in Sydney and Melbourne have no consideration for the residents of Cape York. They talked about buying back land for conservation and creating new World Heritage areas, but nowhere did they commit to security of tenure for the existing residents. When will Labor learn that the residents of Cape York, the Daintree and, for that matter, other areas are an absolutely integral part of managing and protecting the environment? If you lock up these areas there will be no-one left to manage the weeds, control the feral animals and manage and protect the sensitive environment there. The Labor Party's policies in Far North Queensland were led by Senator Jan McLucas and her socialist left faction, which once held significant power in that area. However, the Labor Party's results in this election were the lowest ever—and you can see why. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>197</page.no><name role="metadata">Vamvakinou, Maria, MP</name><name role="display">Ms VAMVAKINOU</name><name.id>00AMT</name.id><electorate>Calwell</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the member for Deakin for having the courage to admit that he, like me and so many other members of the House, is a latte lover. Leaving the latte lovers alone and getting down to business, I would like to begin my speech in the address-in-reply debate by placing on record my gratitude to the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Hon. Neil Andrew, who was a wonderful Speaker. I had an opportunity to get to know him better when I was part of a delegation to Chile a couple of years ago, which he led. I wish Neil and his wife, Carolyn, a happy retirement. It is a hard-earned retirement and I know they are looking forward to it. As a new member, I found him as Speaker very helpful, inviting and encouraging.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the voters of the federal electorate of Calwell, who have given me the privilege and the honour to represent them in this place for a second term. It is difficult to believe that three years have passed and that I now no longer have the cover of being a new member. As I enter my second term, I presume it is expected that I have mastered the art of a lot of things, but I would like to reflect on my previous term. There are two particularly rewarding experiences that I had. The most significant one for me was the private member's motion on breast prostheses that I moved in my first year here. It highlighted the difficulties that lots of women had once they were diagnosed with breast cancer and the difficulty in acquiring adequate prostheses after a mastectomy. </para><para>That private member's motion, of course, led to my party, the Labor Party, adopting a policy for a nationally funded program for the provision of breast prostheses for women who have had mastectomies. I would like to say again that such a program would address what is still an unacceptable situation which exists with state hospital budgets that do not provide adequate and sufficient breast prostheses for women with breast cancer. That problem continues to exist and will continue to exist until such time as this government or a future government acts to establish a national, dedicated, fully funded program specifically for the provision of breast prostheses.</para><para>My other significant experience was the work that I did as the Australian delegate to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. This work and experience gave me an incredible insight into the work of parliamentarians from around the world. I can only say that the experiences and the knowledge I gained were invaluable on a personal level and certainly on a professional level.</para><para>During the 2004 election and in the months since, we have heard much talk about family values and the importance of family life. As a woman who is both a member of parliament and a mother, I want to say that I am encouraged when I hear this discussion because that means that perhaps the political culture and traditions of this place may start to better accommodate family life. I have found that change has occurred and is occurring. It is happening slowly, but I can say that, if we as parliamentarians seek in the course of our jobs to improve the lives of Australian families, I think we need to lead by example.</para><para>It is very important to our overall democratic process that, as individuals and members of parliament, we are seen to be practising the values that we want to promote to the broader community. So I look forward to the debates around family life and values, and in particular I look forward to the examination of government policies on the basis of how they impact not just on families but on community relations as a whole, because, although the traditional family is the bedrock of our society, we have to accept the fact that there exist many different family structures, all worthy of our acknowledgement, all worthy of legitimacy and certainly all worthy of our support.</para><para>No one political party has a monopoly on family values, and I certainly will not be tolerating any situation where self-appointed representatives or advocates of `family' are allowed to operate from a narrow basis and seek to impose or mandate their views on the general community. This would be a danger to our democratic society and to the cohesion of our diverse and multicultural society.</para><para>I would like to thank the people who have made my re-election possible. Firstly, I want to thank my own family, whose understanding of my working hours and long stays in Canberra is always appreciated by me, although sometimes resented by them. I am sure that we all agree that being a member of parliament and travelling to Canberra is indeed very difficult on family life and, in particular, on young children. Obviously, as MPs we make a lot of sacrifices. I do not think the general public appreciate just how many sacrifices we do make, but I could not do this job without the support of my husband and, I guess, to a certain extent his sacrifices. In addition to his role as an academic he has taken on many new roles and I think that he has come through with flying colours. So as a former teacher I give him a big gold star. He has done extremely well and I could not do this job without his support and encouragement. </para><para>I would also like to thank my electorate staff who are very important to me and to all of us—Joanne, Ismail, Brendan, Ros, Helen, Gulay and Bronwyn. I know there are a lot of them but believe me we are operating within the frameworks here. I would also like to thank those who have moved on—Elliot and Jason. I thank them all for their tireless efforts during the time that they served in our office and during the election campaign. Of course, I want to thank all of the people who make up the Calwell FEA and the Calwell campaign committee. It is not possible to stand here without the support of these people. I am extremely pleased and honoured to have them working with me and I want to continue to work with them in the interests of the people of Calwell.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phillip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Barresi</name></talker><para>—Particularly, the people of Greenvale!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMT</name.id><name role="metadata">Vamvakinou, Maria, MP</name><name role="display">Ms VAMVAKINOU</name></talker><para>—Indeed, particularly the people of Greenvale. Calwell is a very diverse electorate. It is a culturally diverse and multifaith electorate with mixed demographics. I know many individuals and groups well because many formed part of my old electorate but there are lots of new groups that I look forward to getting to know and to forming relationships with. Following the last federal redistribution some 61 per cent of voters in the new seat of Calwell voted in the new seat for the first time. So the challenge for me is that I have a significantly changed electorate and, as a result, the electorate that I spoke about in my inaugural speech in 2001 has now become very different.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the south there still remain the familiar, and I must say the much loved, urban communities of Broadmeadows, Tullamarine and Westmeadows. Many of the families in these suburbs earn their living working in either the transport industries at Tullamarine or in the manufacturing facilities of companies like Ford, Nestle or Yakka. In the east of my electorate are the communities of Greenvale, Craigieburn and Roxburgh Park. These communities have many young families and they have been typified as the mortgage belt of my electorate. The families in these communities struggle with high levels of household debt. This is a worrying phenomenon, as Australia has the highest rate of personal and domestic debt in the world. With their large mortgages those people are very vulnerable to interest rate rises. I guess to a certain extent this vulnerability led to the success of the government's interest rate scare campaign during the last federal election. These families will, however, continue to endure the anxieties and pressures that inevitably come with high mortgages. And, with the Prime Minister's refusal during question time yesterday to guarantee that interest rates will not rise, I suspect that many of these families will continue to live in a state of anxiety and difficulty as they try to negotiate family budgets.</para><para>Craigieburn is a new addition to my electorate. I have spent a lot of time in Craigieburn getting to know the people and the community. In particular, I would like to note the great work of Rita McMillin of Selwyn House. She works tirelessly to run this fantastic local community centre. Craigieburn is an old community which is now surrounded by a fast growing outer urban sprawl. With more growth predicted—I think we are expecting 15,000 new people to move into Craigieburn within the next 10 years—the challenge for all of us will be to ensure that the infrastructure keeps up with community growth. In particular in Craigieburn I would like to thank the local church organisations such as the Brotherhood of St Lawrence and the Anglican Church, who form the backbone of community services, and I look forward to continue working with the church groups in assisting them with the wonderful work that they do with the community. In addition, the recently formed Craigieburn Progress Association is another great organisation and another step in community building. I want to thank Spencer and Brenda Davis for their initiative and the amount of work and commitment they have put into establishing the Craigieburn Progress Association. </para><para>Finally, in the west of my electorate lies the communities of Bulla and Sunbury. Bulla is a very small community of only 380 people, but Sunbury is a substantial new addition to the federal seat of Calwell. Sunbury has grown from being a small regional town centre to having a population of about 35,000 and growing. Sunbury is a beautiful community, a beautiful town, and its inhabitants insist that it is well known as the birthplace for the `Ashes'. It is also becoming very well known for its wineries and the production of some of the very best Australian wines. The more established wineries of Goonawarra and Craiglee and an abundance of smaller boutique wineries make this area an attractive place for those who wish to invest in one of Australia's fastest growing and most successful export industries. In fact, yesterday I had a meeting with a delegation from the European Union and they made the point that one in every second bottle of wine they open at the EU—I presume at dinners and so forth—is an Australian wine. So the success of our wine is phenomenal and we should be proud of that. I am certainly proud to have Sunbury in my electorate contributing to this phenomenal success.</para><para>I have met a lot of wonderful people in Sunbury. There are many great people who live and work there and who are active in the community. I acknowledge the fantastic work in particular of Ray Scrace and the Sunbury Men's Drop-In Centre who operate a woodworking shop for older male residents at the local community health centre. This facility gives many of the older residents a daily sense of purpose. The drop-in centre helps them tackle the ever-increasing problem of loneliness and depression which many older men face, whether it is because they have lost partners or are coping with chronic or debilitating illnesses. This is a great problem in the community of Sunbury.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 1.00 p.m. to 4.01 p.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMT</name.id><name role="metadata">Vamvakinou, Maria, MP</name><name role="display">Ms VAMVAKINOU</name></talker><para>—Before the suspension of the sitting I was speaking about issues of concern to my electorate of Calwell and, in particular, to the town of Sunbury. I was congratulating Ray Scrace and his men's drop-in centre for the work that they do—the centre accommodates men who are looking for a place to drop in and perhaps do some woodwork or have a bit of a chat—and making the point that mental health is a serious issue, not just for the broader Australian community but for my electorate and for Sunbury. I am very pleased about the government's election promise committing $110 million to mental health awareness—I certainly look forward to that, as I know we all do. This issue requires attention at the highest level. Mental health afflicts the young and the old, men and women alike. It is an issue I took a keen interest in in the previous parliament and I will continue to take an interest in it in this parliament. While I am addressing this issue I would like to congratulate the Schizophrenia Friendship Group, which today launched a kit for our electorate offices and our staff. It is a wonderful kit that gives our staff an opportunity to understand constituents who may present with mental health symptoms.</para></talk.start></continue><para>While on the subject of Sunbury, I take the opportunity to thank Ted Jarrett from the Goonawarra Golf Club. Ted is an icon of the Sunbury community who works hard to support his club. His efforts are tireless. He is a man who, though at retirement age, is still dreaming big dreams for his community and, in particular, for the development and prosperity of his beloved golf club. I am honoured to accept the club's offer to be their patron. Even though I know almost nothing about golf, I look forward to the challenges that being patron will present to me. </para><para>As we enter this new term of parliament my electorate faces many of the challenges that are typical for communities in outer metropolitan areas across the nation. I will work hard, in partnership with my community and my constituents, to ensure that their concerns are brought to the attention of the parliament. The government now has the opportunity to address many of the key concerns and issues facing our nation, but its greatest challenge will be to do this by governing in the interests of all Australians. We in the opposition intend to keep a close watch on events in this place and we will do whatever is necessary on behalf of our electorates and in the national interest to ensure that the government is in fact governing for the interests of all Australians. I represent some 85,000 people, a majority of whom did not vote for the government. Nevertheless, their lives will be affected by policies that this government implements in the next three years, and I am certain that that effect will not always be beneficial or positive.</para><para>In my inaugural speech I spoke about my commitment to our multicultural community and to reconciliation with our Indigenous communities. Unfortunately, both issues have suffered serious setbacks in recent years. I would like to make the point that we have a responsibility to promote harmony and racial tolerance in a substantial way. In the life of this parliament I aim to lend my voice and support to the advancement of Indigenous issues. My electorate has large ethnic communities and a significant Indigenous population, with Calwell being on the land whose traditional owners are the Wurundjeri people of the Coolum nation. I am proud to say that the many and varied cultural groups in Calwell work well to demonstrate how strong community partnerships can advance their cause. In the case of the Indigenous community there is excellent work being done by Koori activists working with Dianella Community Health, Best Start and the Koori Education Centre in order to tackle education, health and social issues.</para><para>Earlier I mentioned family values and the concern I and others have about narrow interpretations of what constitutes a family or family values. I believe family values cannot be defined on the basis of religious principles alone; rather, family values are also impacted upon and defined by cultural and historical traditions and practices. I spoke of the contribution that multiculturalism has made to this country. Beyond language, food and culture lies a great tradition of family values that many Australians, and indeed governments and policymakers, can learn from. I think it is important that we learn from the family traditions of multicultural, multifaith Australia. I think we should learn from the values of the extended family and how collective living, and the responsibility of caring for each other beyond the nuclear family, can be of benefit to a society that it is all too focused on the individual.</para><para>At a time when relationships break down so quickly and catastrophically, and with the youth suicide rate climbing to a level that is unacceptable, I think that political parties such as Family First, and even the government, have a lot to learn from the family values of other faiths and cultures—because family values, as defined by many people, are not the monopoly of particular Christian denominations. These lessons could be taken from the homes—multicultural and multifaith—of Australian families, and especially from the family values of our newer communities and our emerging Muslim community. Many lessons could be learnt from the honest and hard-working multifaith families living in Meadow Heights and Dallas in my electorate and elsewhere across the country. If we want to look at how the family can bring some sense to this chaotic and insecure world we live in, let us look a little further into our own neighbours' backyards. Let us learn from them and listen to what they have to say. </para><para>In closing I would like again to thank the people of Calwell for giving me the opportunity to serve them in this parliament for a second term. I want to thank my colleagues, my friends and my own family for their assistance and the support that they have given me. I am very proud to represent the people of Calwell and I hope that I will be able to serve them well in the next three years. I take this opportunity also to welcome the new members to this parliament. I was a new member in the last term; I know that you face many challenges. It is a great learning curve but it is a great honour to serve people in this parliament—so welcome. For my part, I look forward to the challenges ahead for me and my electorate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>202</page.no><name role="metadata">Broadbent, Russell, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROADBENT</name><name.id>MT4</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the member for Calwell in this address-in-reply, particularly with regard to the family values that are common to all Australians, be they black, white or any other colour, whatever their background and wherever they come from. Like me, the member for Calwell represents a seat that has a diverse community. Being someone who comes from a regional area with a very high migrant background, I can identify with her and with her compassion for the community that she serves. We would all be well served if we took note of the address that has just been given to this House and invested in our communities the way that she has.</para></talk.start><para>My second remark with regard to the last speaker's address is that I was complimented by her in her welcome to new members. This is the third time that I have been a new member to this House. Unlike the member for Calwell, I have never been able to string two consecutive periods of representation together. She said she had been re-elected to this House and thanked the people of Calwell. The Leader of the Opposition said yesterday that if he had his way he would not mind having the Prime Minister's record rather than his own. I say to the member for Calwell that I would not mind your record instead of the record I am about to present to this House.</para><para>Much has happened since members began to speak in the debate on the address-in-reply to the Governor-General's speech. Later on I would particularly like to speak about the tsunami, the bushfires and the difficulties that the Australian community and the world community have faced and those that they have faced as one. I stand here today as a marginal seat member of this parliament, the member for McMillan for the second time, after an amazing victory over a very strong opponent from the Labor Party named Christian Zahra, who ran an excellent campaign and was highly regarded by the community. I wish him all the best in his future activities, as he represented the constituency of McMillan, particularly in the time from when I was defeated until I came back into this House, with distinction, energy and, in particular, youthfulness and determination.</para><para>I am not a hater of the opposition. I am not a hater of the Labor Party. In fact, I am someone who believes that we all have a contribution to make whichever party we come from. We all have a position and we all come from different backgrounds and, whatever the issues that we have to face as parliamentarians in this place as representatives of our community, we should always hold our opposition colleagues, our ministers and the people that work in this house in the highest regard for two reasons. One is that it is a very hard road to become a federal member of parliament. There is not one person here who has arrived on an easy train. The second is that we owe it to the broader community of Australia—we owe it to the nation—that we pay respect to one another so that they can then take that lead and respect one another in the broader community. In saying that, I mean that we can draw out the best from our parliamentary colleagues and the best from the people who work in this house, whatever the role that they play, whether it is the young person who is delivering newspapers to federal members' offices at half past six in the morning, the Clerk of the House or those representatives who make this house, this place of democracy, work. </para><para>After those few words I wish to indulge myself for just one moment and recognise that I did not get into the seat of McMillan on my own. I had supporting my campaign a man named Neville Goodwin, who came in with determination, desire and energy; Ken Smith MLA, the state member for the seat of Bass in Victoria; of course my family; Victorian senator Judith Troeth, who worked the electorate as a patron senator for six years of blood, sweat and tears until she came home with me victorious; and a group of young girls—Cara, Priscilla and Julie-Anne—who called themselves the A Team because they were the back-up, the information and research people and those who supplied the energy. They were the ones that supported me daily. They got up early in the morning; they were with me. I refer to the amazing band of Liberals in the seat of McMillan who decided to never give up and to keep on going and gave me another opportunity, another chance. I refer to Russ Street, who came into the campaign very early on and followed me right through to the finish on the night. I have paid tribute to Christian Zahra. I did that because, having been in so many campaigns, I know when somebody runs a good campaign and I know when someone is good at what they do. I know what I was up against when I took on this enormous task of trying to win back—as I note—this redistributed seat. Former member Barry Simon lost his seat of McMillan when it was redistributed and Korumburra was taken out of it. He lost it to Barry Cunningham. I think redistributions play a greater role in what happens in seats across Australia than the brilliance of members and their activities as candidates can ever attest. I know that, in the pitching and throwing that happens in politics in Australia, a redistribution can make all the difference.</para><para>Our campaign was very low key, and I thank all the people whom I have just named. They stuck together very closely. They were a very small team, but a very important team. Having lost four federal election campaigns and won three since 1983, and having more than 20 years of political activity, even I am amazed to be back here—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Quick</name></talker><para>—Lots of scars.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>MT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Broadbent, Russell, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROADBENT</name></talker><para>—Lots of scars—knowing I have taken three seats from Labor but having been defeated by Labor four times in the past.

It goes all the way down to beautiful Wilsons Promontory, to Wonthaggi and to Inverloch. My seat goes from the snow to the sea, from Mount Baw Baw all the way through to the ocean. As every member in this House will say, it is one of the most beautiful electorates that you could ever drive through. Members, you should take any opportunity to come to beautiful Gippsland and see our beautiful green hills, even at this time of year. We have had some lovely, refreshing rain. It has not been accepted by everybody with such glee, but it certainly has in our area. It is the most magnificent part of the world, and I feel honoured, blessed and openly thrilled to be the member for McMillan. </para><para>I do feel new. Even though I have been to this House three times before—I tried to get here in 1984 and 1987 but did not succeed—I feel new and fresh. I am sending a message out to other people that (1) you should never give up, but you have heard that before, and (2) it does not matter what age you are; it is how you think and the opportunities that you can grab that matter. To young people who would like to have a future as a federal or a state parliamentarian, I say take the chance when it comes. Never say: `I'm too young. I'm too old. I'm too tall. I'm too short. I haven't got enough hair,' or `I don't look good enough.' Forget that. If the opportunity arises and you have a heart to serve the people, come on down because this is the place for you to be.</para><para>There were issues in our campaign that made a difference. South Gippsland is a most beautiful area. Let me take you on a quick drive and swing you out of Melbourne until you get past the suburbs and into the Strzelecki Ranges and over towards Wilsons Prom, into that beautiful and pristine area where you come over the Foster hills and the whole vista of Wilsons Prom is spread out before you, with the beautiful ocean and the crystal clear waters. If the wind turbine companies have their way, as you look down that vista you will see row after row after row of wind turbines. The people in south Gippsland have said, `No, we don't want to change.' Without mentioning names, there are former Labor and Liberal politicians, including senators, living down there and they are all of one accord. It is a pristine community—a glorious place.</para><para>One of the members in the chamber now is from Tasmania. I visited that state because someone said it is Australia's best kept secret, and I did not know it until I went down there for a week and needed three weeks. It is so beautiful. You have to remember that south Gippsland is the closest thing there is to Tasmania. I am in the most south-easterly seat on the mainland. The rocks that are under me that have been there for thousands of years before we came along are the same rocks that are under Tasmania. It is the same string of mountains. So we are related by rocks, by beautiful hills and by pristine countryside.</para><para>People travel the world to find places just as I have described to you. It is a matter of sincere passion when I say to you that I am not going to sacrifice the beautiful coastline of Gippsland on the altar of renewable energy. In fact, I would be distraught if I—after all this time and after all the work—became the member responsible for the destruction of that area for the next 75 years by the placement of wind turbines on the coast. I know there are people on all sides of politics who are opposed to wind turbines in that area. There are plenty of places in Australia where people want turbines, but generally the community in south Gippsland has said, `We don't want them here. We don't want them on the access road to the promontory. We don't want them spread across Bald Hills. We don't want them spread across the Dollar Hills. We don't want them close to our coastline.'</para><para>If you went to any city people, say, in Victoria, and said, `Here's your pristine Brighton Beach,' or in Coogee and said, `We're just going to put up a few little wind turbines on Coogee Beach,' there would be an absolute uproar. Or the same would happen if someone wanted to put a row of wind turbines just outside Parliament House here so that we could run some power into the place—at the moment, we cannot even build a proper fence around it, but that is another issue for another time. I am pleading with the Greens, some of whom—named here—think that we should be selling wind turbines better because they are such beautiful things. Would this lady, who is a Green from somewhere, want them? You are going to say, `Not in my backyard—this is a nimby issue.' This is not a nimby issue. It is not an issue of substance—such as the Pakenham bypass, interest rates, the lowest unemployment in 10 years, but there is still more to be done in the seat of McMillan. This is a burning issue for people. The way things are going, it may take five minutes to erect these wind turbines—they said they can be put up very quickly—but they will be there for 25 years. So it could take a generation to put them up, a generation that puts up with them and a generation to pull them down. </para><para>When I started this exercise, I thought, `This is a pretty clean, green way to produce power.' I have moved completely away from that, not from becoming a candidate for that seat but from learning what wind turbines are all about. On further investigation I have found that they are not as efficient or effective and that they disrupt the power source. There is a real problem with them. I am going to be one of those members—I am sorry, members who are gathered here today—who will talk and talk about wind turbines until I stop them from ruining the Gippsland coastline, until I can go back to the people there and say, `I represented you reasonably and fairly. Look, there are no wind turbines on the Gippsland coastline. It is there for your children.'</para><para>The immediate concern is the declining land values because of wind turbines being located next door. The issue is splitting communities because those who are going to benefit from wind turbines want them and those who are going to have their life and amenity depleted by wind turbines do not want them.</para><para>Without talking about noise, without talking about the amenity of the area, without talking about the visual and landscape aspects, without talking about the planning aspects, without talking about being railroaded by state governments, without talking about subsidies for wind turbines which, without the subsidies, would not even be going up, the simple message I want to send today is this—and my staff will be furious because I have not stuck to the notes they gave me for my address to the House today—I know that the heart of the people is to save that pristine area for future generations.</para><para>I am excited and proud to identify with the government, the opposition and the people of Australia in our response to the events of Boxing Day last year, and I know that all members of this House support every effort the government put in. I am sure that every member of this House was enamoured, amazed and taken aback by the generosity of the Australian people in their efforts on behalf of people who have had their lives destroyed—the many hundreds of thousands who were killed. I must leave this message with you: my fear on Boxing Day night and the next day was that we were going to be faced with thousands of Australians killed. I do identify with those who have lost—and there have been many—but how blessed is this nation that we lost so few when we could have lost so many, and that we were in some way protected? It has just amazed me every time I have seen the footage of the families that have lost and the stories of the miraculous escapes. The Australian people and the people in my electorate have raised so much money and thrown their heart and soul at the devastation that has happened after the tsunami. </para><para>I am proud this day to be a resident of that part of Victoria which is connected to Tasmania by rock. I want to protect the pristine community. I am proud today to be a new member in this House and to participate in the address-in-reply to the Governor-General's speech. I am proud today to say that I am part of a government that has responded in this way to the needs of those who are least able to care for themselves at this most difficult time. I am also proud to say, in response to the nine deaths in another bushfire in South Australia, that we were able to respond quickly. This nation has now trained its organisations, public servants and authorities to respond quickly. The first people into Aceh were Australians at all levels. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to bring this to the attention of the House today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>206</page.no><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr QUICK</name><name.id>AV5</name.id><electorate>Franklin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It seems a long time ago that we gathered in the Senate to hear the Governor-General deliver his speech on the opening of parliament.

It is great to be back here for the fifth time as the federal member for Franklin. It is something of a record. The Labor Party only ever won four elections in a row in Franklin, and that was way back in the 1940s when Mr Frost was the federal member for Franklin. Winning the seat in 2004 meant I was lucky enough to win five in a row, and so set the bar a little higher. I, like all other members, would like to thank all the people who worked tirelessly on the campaign. I have always advocated that, once you are re-elected, you start on the next campaign and you structure your three years as the federal member so that the people you look after are catered for—their every whim and demand are usually looked after as best as you can by you and your wonderful staff—and when the 33 days of madness comes along you are not swept up by all the excitement, you do not pour thousands of letters into the post office and then wonder why people are disillusioned with you. I have never intended, in the five campaigns that I have contested, to spend a dray load of money (a) because I do not have it and (b) the punters are not stupid, as I have said. With all the stuff that is stuck in letterboxes in a normal week, let alone what is put in there during the election campaign, why would they bother to read it? A grassroots campaign has always been my strategy, and it has been successful so far in five terms.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I would like to pay my compliments to Henry Finnis, my Liberal Party opponent. Henry was a commanding officer in the Navy in Tasmania for three years and then came back here to Canberra, worked in the bureaucracy in the Navy and then was convinced to come down and try his luck against me in 2004. Henry, to his credit, ran a very creditable campaign—a very clean, policy driven campaign—but he was unsuccessful. Over that period of 33 days—it was actually 42 days with the extra week we had—Henry and I got to know each other really well, and we have maintained that friendship since 9 October.</para><para>Five terms in this place is pretty good, I guess, but the frustrating thing is that I am on the other side where you cannot really do much and the bags of money are not necessarily thrown in your direction.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs Gash</name></talker><para>—Tasmania got a lot.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr QUICK</name></talker><para>—The funny thing is that it is always thrown at Bass, because Bass has always been a marginal seat and, for a little country town of about 60,000 or 70,000 people, more infrastructure resource money would be spent on it than any other comparable town in Australia. Unfortunately, the state Liberal and Labor parties do exactly the same. Braddon, Bass and northern Lyons are where government is decided—not in Denison and Franklin—and that is where all the money goes. That is where all the good roads are. That is where we have a plethora of hospitals and people are looked after and pork-barrelled beyond compare. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I have set myself a couple of things to try to sort out in my fifth term. One is the treatment of veterans. We have only three of the First World War Diggers left. What worries me is that, with so few left, we have not really learnt how to look after our veterans. In 1994 we took a whole lot of veterans back to Europe, and then I was privileged in 1995, on the 80th anniversary, to go over with a representative of each of the states and territories and Norfolk Island. That special part of our history was recognised, but the Diggers were suddenly gone. The same thing is happening with our Second World War guys. Most of them now are in their 80s. Their numbers are depleting by dozens virtually every day.</para><para>Some of our DVA officers really worry me. They seem to me to be happy to thwart and frustrate the veterans. I will give you an example. When a veteran wants to go to visit the doctor they have to go through some paperwork so that they can get a taxi refund and DVA does not think they are rorting the system. Each of us here has a Cabcharge card. We are accountable. Our Cabcharge account comes in every month, and we have to sign off to say we have done the right thing and we have not rorted the system. I know of instances where veterans in their 90s have forgotten to remind the doctor to put the date on a form—and when the form goes in it comes back. The veteran has to then go back to the doctor to fill out another form or to get the first form signed or dated. Why not give all these Second World War guys a bloody cabcharge? You can monitor it. They call the taxi, swipe their card, sign the form, go to the doctor and do the reverse on the way back. Are we just keeping the DVA people happy and shuffling paper?</para><para>I went to my local DVA office in Hobart, and said, `How many thousands of bits of paper do you send back to the veterans, who then go back to get it date stamped or signed by the doctor, most of whom are racing around like headless chooks?' and they said, `Thousands of them.' God knows how many of these forms, around Australia, are going backwards and forwards and costing more money when there is a simple solution. We are not talking about a lot of people. Give them a Cabcharge card each. It could easily be monitored by the department, and all the paperwork is gone. We are supposed to have a paperless society, for God's sake. Something as simple as that would relieve all the tension. I say to the DVA: your job there is to look after the veterans, not thwart them and frustrate them. Many of them have gone through being either a POW in Japan or a POW in Germany. And there is another issue. We have never given those guys or their families $25,000. I can tell you for sure that a lot of the trauma that they went through in Germany was just as bad as the punishment, in lots of cases, under the Japanese. We gave the 16 Korean POWs their $25,000—but `stick it up your jumper' to the ones who were in Europe. They have some terrible stories to tell. I say to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs: have a look at some of the DVA offices and think about a Cabcharge card.</para><para>While we are talking about DVA, it is the 90th anniversary of Gallipoli this year—a really special time. It is special to me because my dad was there as a young 18-year-old with the 7th Battalion. He managed to survive that and then go over to France—and on 19 July 1916 he was one of the 5,335 who got absolutely hammered at Fromelle. He came home an invalid at 19. I would like to think that some of us could go over there. As many of us who do want to go and who can pay our way could have some arrangement as Australian government representatives. I know the minister is going to go, the PM will go, Kim Beazley will probably go and the shadow defence minister will go; but I think we as a parliament ought to make a symbolic pilgrimage—as many of us as possible. We are not going to be here. Parliament is not going to be sitting. The government, through the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister for Defence, should say, `We are going to charter a couple of Qantas planes, and all those who want to go will pay their way.' We have thousands of frequent flyer points, travel entitlements and study leave. Let us organise something rather than suddenly seeing in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, the <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>or the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> that a little select group of people are going over there and no-one else is involved. Let us open it up to each and every one of us to go over, because there are only three of the First World War guys left. Let us make this, the 90th anniversary, very special. </para><para>Honourable members would know that we had a few hassles in Tassie: we lost a couple of seats. We lost Sid Sidebottom, the member for Braddon, and also Michelle O'Byrne, the member for Bass. We had a bit of a bunfight about the forests and some of us had some rather nasty things to say about our state Premier. You would be happy to know that we have kissed and made up. We kissed and made up over the tsunami appeal—strange times, and strange times bring people together. I would like to put on the public record that the whole forest issue in Tasmania needs to be sorted out once and for all. It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister went over and spoke to the cheering timber workers, saying, `I'm going to sort the problem out. I promise you 170,000 hectares will be locked away. You're not going to lose your jobs and everything will be fine.' He said he would send Senator Ian Macdonald or one of the other senators down to sort the mess out and it would all be done before Christmas. Christmas has come and gone and nothing has been sorted out.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs Gash</name></talker><para>—So did the tsunami and so did everything else.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr QUICK</name></talker><para>—I know. The honourable member opposite says a whole lot of things, but we have had several visits from the minister responsible, the senator, and nothing has changed. I would say to the people of Tasmania: I think you have been conned. You have been shown the old sleight of hand card trick. The sad thing about the whole forest debate is that it has been going on for far too long. We have been gazing at our navels, we almost know the name of every tree in Tasmania, and Tasmanians are sick and tired of the whole issue. Let us put it aside and get on with some of the other issues that are just as important.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the things that I would like to mention is the issue of Indigenous health. The Australian Medical Association came out and made statements about how terrible it all was. It almost seems like a yearly event. I was lucky enough to be on the House committee that did a report into Indigenous health called <inline font-style="italic">Health is life</inline>. It was an excellent report. People extolled it as the blueprint to solve Indigenous health. The government responded almost four or five years ago, but one wonders whether anybody has the backbone to really get involved with the states and territories to ensure that their various health, education and housing ministers and also the local government authorities are putting the money where it should be spent. Today we had a bit of a debate about some of the money that is thrown around at election time. Some of it seems to be highly desirable; other parts of it seem to be a waste of time, energy and effort in an attempt to purchase a seat. Indigenous health can be resolved and it can be sorted out, but someone has to grasp the nettle and say, `We are going to do it,' because if you wander around Australia you see that it is in an appalling state of affairs. </para><para>Another issue is substance abuse. We are seeing in our newspapers almost daily the effect of cannabis on the mental health of so many of our young people and also people generally across our society. Once again, the then House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs put out, in August 2003, an excellent report called <inline font-style="italic">Road</inline><inline font-style="italic">to</inline><inline font-style="italic">recovery</inline>. I am sad to say that the government has not responded to the heaps and heaps of recommendations. Some of the states are taking this into their own hands, and I would like to compliment the Victorian government for its introduction of random drug testing. That had a few bugs to start with, but that is now accepted to be the first and the best way of trying to catch those who are partaking of such substances. To its credit, the government of Tasmania has decided to follow. But why do we still have to have this railroad gauge mentality? Why can't we have a national approach to these issues? Why can't we say that we are going to do this nationally, rather than each state coming along and saying, `We'll try it,' and then we do it? For goodness sake, Victoria led the way with random breath tests, 0.05 and seat belts and all the rest of the states were drawn kicking and screaming along to do it.</para><para>We need a national approach. We are a national parliament. If it was up to me I would get rid of all the states and have a national approach, a regional approach. Let's hear some of this stuff being expounded up here. I do not give a toss whether it is a Liberal or a Labor federal government, as long as someone gets off their whatsit and does some of these things. For God's sake, we have a national weights system. Do we have a national time system? No. If you are the Queensland Premier or the Western Australian Premier or the Tasmanian Premier you have your own time over summer. For God's sake, China has got one time zone, a national time zone: Beijing time. We have got all these issues and we are pussyfooting around. Let's do something as a national parliament to solve some of these issues. I know they might sound peripheral and airy-fairy but, for God's sake, some of them really impact on people in our community.</para><para>Another issue I would like to speak about briefly is the issue of carers. This is another group of people who are unsung, who are saving our governments—nation, state and local—millions and millions of dollars. Do they get any real recognition? Occasionally they do, and we have National Carers Day and we all go and pay tribute to them. But when you talk to carers you should ask them about some of the Centrelink hassles. For God's sake, we need to start resolving some of these and ironing out some of the issues for people who are carers. They are operating on a shoestring and having to fight Centrelink. The bureaucracy has gone mad, for goodness sake. Let's really recognise them by giving them what they really deserve.</para><para>Finally, in my last minute and 43 seconds, I want to talk about the issue of child care. As an ex-teacher I say to the child-care industry: `We undervalue you. We underpay you. You are in most cases providing the first foundation stone for our young people. We do not have a national registration or a national training regime. We do not pay you a decent wage.' For goodness sake, let's look at that issue. In the next three years, those opposite and we must work together with our state colleagues to ensure that we have a national framework. Community based child care and for-profit child care can work together, but they need to be paid properly and they need to have training. And we need to get away from early childhood teachers in the state system saying: `You're worthless. We're the first teachers, and you're just doing the babysitting and the mickey mouse stuff.' It is a total educative process. </para><para>As I said, it is great to be back for my fifth term. It is great to see many of my friends on the other side whom I love and admire and respect. Hopefully the 150 of us can work together in this wonderful place to ensure that once this three-year term is over we can look back and say, `We've made a difference.'</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>210</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will start my contribution to the address-in-reply debate by expressing my great honour and gratitude to the people of Gilmour for their confidence, friendship and guidance in returning me as a member. I am grateful for the opportunity and for being permitted to continue representing them in this House. I would also like to thank Martin Laverty and David Smith and all my campaign team for their trust and confidence in me. Now the work really starts. Among the first of our campaign promises was that this government would introduce institutions for excellence in trade skills. Already expressions of interest for 24 regional areas have been called for throughout Australia. The Illawarra is one of those regions, and as the Shoalhaven is part of the Illawarra I can assure residents that the Shoalhaven City Council and industry have already lodged an expression of interest.</para></talk.start><para>The Shoalhaven has many unique advantages to offer and a great opportunity to bring social and economic benefits to a region that the New South Wales Carr government is obviously leaving behind. I see two specialty areas that would be ideal in developing a synergistic component to complement our local industrial base. Those areas are the composite industry—fibreglass, carbon fibre, Kevlar and so on—and electrical engineering and avionics. Members may be aware that Nowra has a naval base, HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Albatross</inline>, supporting naval air operations. It was once the headquarters of the Fleet Air Arm and so has a long and illustrious tradition in supporting military avionics.</para><para>Nowra also has a vibrant boatbuilding industry which will complement trade training facilities when established. The boatbuilding industry has a strong export focus and many of the international racing yachts manufactured in this country and exported to Asia and Europe are manufactured in Nowra. The synergy between the aviation industry and the boatbuilding industry with regard to composites would provide a firm foundation for a curriculum to be offered. This curriculum would also support the automotive industry, which, in recent times, as all of us would realise, has been increasingly orientated towards composite materials both in the original equipment and in the repair automotive sectors.</para><para>The defence industry capability around Nowra has grown in recent years. Many of the international defence companies are represented in Nowra, thanks to the Howard government fostering the defence industry and to the foresight of Shoalhaven City Council to encourage those industries to be established in our electorate. For years those in the industry and business sector have been discussing with Shoalhaven City Council the problem of skills shortages and the amount of headhunting that exists. It is a well-known trend that the Australian defence department trains its people well and industry is not backward in poaching this expertise at the expense of the Australian taxpayer. I should add here that as a former business employer I am fully committed to seeing employers made responsible for the training of their employees so that all can share in the benefits. </para><para>Shoalhaven City Council is one of the first councils to put their money where their mouth is by putting on additional trainers and apprentices, and I commend it for that. Within the Shoalhaven, over 500 employers currently participate in a vocational education program with local high schools. In addressing some of the skills shortages in this aviation industry, one local registered training organisation, Aerospace Training Services, has developed a course approved by the New South Wales Board of Studies as part of the higher school certificate program. It offers this to local students in both the Shoalhaven and the Wollongong areas and is undertaken at the Australian Aviation Museum located at HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Albatross</inline>. This is just one example that is addressing our dire skills shortages.</para><para>Discussions have already ensued between Shoalhaven City Council and the University of Wollongong, who have a campus in West Nowra whose creation was made possible by this federal government. All are very keen about the prospect of such a facility being available in the Shoalhaven, as the present education precinct would auger well for a technical college, and commencing next year a medical school—again, fully funded by the government. We have a TAFE college with in excess of 4,000 students and there is the recently announced Sealab, now known as the Shoalhaven Marine and Freshwater Centre. All are located in the university precinct. So, Mr Deputy Speaker, you can see why we would like to add a technical college to the site to work in conjunction with our high schools. A meeting has been called to gather all our expertise to present a united approach. This brings me to another promise made by me that I would investigate the possibility of training for nurses, especially in aged care and how that could interact with our medical school. I will be discussing this with the university, the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Education, Science and Training.</para><para>Where to from here? As far as the electorate of Gilmore is concerned, I can report a genuine atmosphere of confidence. Even those who may not have voted for us realise that Australia and Gilmore are doing pretty well. It really came home to me last week when some of the training network providers claimed they had difficulty in filling places for Work for the Dole as people were actually working. Today people seem to be more satisfied with their lot, and there is a distinct absence of apprehension about the future. I am heartened by the many positive statements people have expressed to me recently, suggesting they have faith in the direction in which we are going.</para><para>The Shoalhaven, Kiama and the Southern Highlands have been rediscovered. People want to live, work and play here. Yet one of the greatest obstacles to encouraging growth was the lack of job opportunities and the absence of comprehensive and modern services. This is changing with more and more commercial enterprises setting up shop, creating employment opportunities for young families.</para><para>Without a doubt, the most significant project we have going is the construction of main road 92 or the Shoalhaven Highway from Nowra to Canberra. The benefits that this link to the economic centres of south-east Australia will bring to the region are enormous. Such a link will have the effect of redistributing traffic flows of freight so that, instead of bypassing the South Coast, they will be able to add yet another economic centre to their routes. Yet after announcing $34 million worth of funding as far back as 1998, six years ago, progress remains slow. The state government continue to drag their heels seemingly with disinterest at cultivating this new economic hub. Rather, their emphasis has been on preserving the status quo, discouraging growth through inaction and hesitation six years after the deal was made. </para><para>So many opportunities have been lost. No wonder that people lose faith. What should have been done was to build the road together with the eastern gas pipeline and the Telstra fibre optic cable. Now of course—you guessed it—cables et cetera have to be moved at a huge cost to the taxpayer. However, being the eternal optimist, I am pleased to report that the work will be commencing in 2005. It is almost as if there is a reluctance on the part of the state government—but for reasons best known to them. As if to emphasise this reluctance to open the South Coast to economic benefits, the state government continues to avoid confronting the need to upgrade the Princes Highway, despite the appalling record of road deaths over recent months.</para><para>My colleague in the state seat of South Coast, Shelley Hancock, is also conscious of the surge in demand and has called on the state government to accelerate the investigation of a third bridge crossing over the Shoalhaven River. The present crossing represents a traffic bottleneck where, if a major incident blocked the existing crossing, road traffic would have to be diverted through Goulburn. In this day and age, people have greater expectations of service and, clearly, the existing infrastructure is well overdue for a makeover.</para><para>As enthusiastic as I might be about opening road links, I know and appreciate how important it is to find the right balance. I also appreciate that it is not wise to assume that everything will remain constant and that there exists a need to hedge for the future. That is why I have been enthusiastically pursuing new innovations that will contribute towards a more diverse economic and social culture. Health is becoming more focused in importance each day as our population grows in Gilmore. More and more the community is doing the work of the state government.</para><para>A linear accelerator is required for our increasing number of patients having to travel to Wollongong for treatment—and I use the word `travel' loosely, for you can forget about the trains; you need a car. Until you have been caught in such a situation, it is difficult to imagine the plight of my constituents who rely on this external health service. That is why I will fight tooth and nail to see an MRI licence being granted for the Shoalhaven. Once again, our people have to go to Wollongong for this, as that is the only service licensed in the Illawarra. Shoalhaven has one but it is not licensed and therefore not claimable through Medicare. I am in constant contact with the minister on this matter and anxiously await his decision. Yet again the public have rallied for an oncology unit for the Milton-Ulladulla area hospital and are still waiting for support from the state government, as they are waiting for a linear accelerator.</para><para>In 1996, when the government came into power, Gilmore's aged care services were well below the quota. All licences went to the Illawarra, Wollongong and Shellharbour with Kiama and the Shoalhaven not on the radar. I am pleased to be able to report that since then 1,600 extra beds and aged care packages have been delivered. That is not to say we do not need more—we certainly do. We are hopeful of further announcements to be made. Each of our aged care facilities are first class with excellent staff who really care for our elderly.</para><para>With respect to youth, where do I start? There are always the positive aspects which rarely get mentioned, such as our Defence cadets, our citizen cadets, our recent young people's first aid training course, our talented musicians, our young playwrights and artists—and the list goes on and on. But, as ever, the media concentrates on the negatives, and we have not missed out. There is no doubt that all governments, parents and schools have a responsibility towards lowering our road carnage. This government has announced it will be supporting the notion that young drivers should be taught skills to enable them to survive the carnage of our roadways, and the Princes Highway is certainly a separate issue to be addressed. </para><para>Many of the drivers involved are in the high-risk bracket. They are predominantly male in the 17 to 25 year age group and we have a large percentage of young people in Gilmore. They are not always the victims, but this demographic looms large in many vehicle accidents. Even before the concept of compulsory driver training for that age group was raised, we had started the process to have such a facility in our electorate, both in Nowra and Ulladulla. Yet the New South Wales government withdrew funding recently for one such program, which is hardly surprising given their record. I am on the record as stating that schools have a role to play in the education of would-be drivers, starting by educating them at primary school, certainly with the rules of the road, a sense of respect for others, awareness and respect for the law and setting the right examples in behaviour.</para><para>Whilst still on the subject of young people, I raise the opposite, so to speak, and that is the role of grandparents. In recent years, I have been dismayed at the increase in grandparents taking responsibility for their children's children through sheer necessity, social problems, family break-ups or health or medical reasons. These are wonderful, caring people and they seem to have been forgotten by governments in the past. It is heartbreaking to see grandparents in their 60s and 70s having to take on the responsibility for young children and sometimes three or four in their own family. But they do it without complaint. I would like to thank our former minister, Larry Anthony, for recognising this and creating legislation that will assist these people to lead a financially improved life. I fully acknowledge that a lot more needs to be done and I will work actively towards those changes.</para><para>Without a doubt, family law, child support and child custody is the hardest area to solve in my electorate. It is heart-rending to see parents destroy each other by using their children for their own agendas. There has to be a fairer way of dealing with these issues. Allied to that, this year I have given a further commitment to try and work towards improving the delivery of mental health and depression services. As one who travels extensively throughout the electorate, I cannot but see the areas of concern.</para><para>It is far easier for me to concentrate and actively work towards infrastructure and roads, but it is also incumbent upon me to act and to understand the needs of those with that insidious disease that comes to us through no fault of our own and is so common in today's society. It never ceases to amaze me just how many people are affected by it and how people work to overcome it or, worse still, try to hide it and still lead some semblance of normal life. It is true that there are not enough professional people to deal with this growing problem. The state government does little to recognise it, and if you try to find an establishment where you can get such help there is a waiting list of weeks and months. It is a sad indictment that desperate families have begged to have their child put in jail because they feel that there they would at least get proper treatment. This is not something I am prepared live with. I will actively pursue all levels of government in lifting their role to assist. Another group we will be working for, together with pollies from both sides of the political fence, is our Parkinson's support group, by trying with determination to have them acknowledged on a federal level.</para><para>Tourism and small business are significant contributors to commerce in Gilmore, and it is no secret why so many visitors flock to Gilmore to enjoy our lifestyle. From mountains to the sea, we have it all—from luxury accommodation to a tent by the beach; from large shopping centres to the village general store. My background has been in tourism and hospitality for many years and, as such, I could wax lyrical about the exciting and challenging opportunities on offer to us. Yet we have not succeeded in putting together a project to gain advantage from the many federal tourism grants available. I intend to address that by working energetically towards formulating a suitable approach, together with the tourism officers from Wingecarribee Shire, Shoalhaven and Kiama, with particular emphasis on the off-peak seasons. </para><para>Finally, the completion of our fast-growing university campus at Moss Vale is in sight. It was this government that again recognised the needs of the Shoalhaven and Southern Highlands ever-growing young population and of the need to provide a decent place for tertiary education. With this continued growth has come the need to broaden our horizons and harness the ever-growing cultural, musical and artistic talents on offer. Minister Kemp is well aware of our special icon Bundanon, having visited Gilmore on numerous occasions. Time is now well overdue for a performing, multi-use cultural centre both in the Shoalhaven and Kiama. In a city of about 95,000 such a centre is of necessity to promote our wealth of talent. Council needs assistance to build the facility. The Shoalhaven has an annual growth rate of over two per cent, but council's rate is being stymied through the fact that 65 per cent of the Shoalhaven is either Crown land or National Parks and Wildlife Service reserve. The community has prepared a strong case to support an arts centre, but it needs funding to get the ball rolling. My role will be to help the community find the means to get the project up, an item high on my agenda for this term.</para><para>Last but not least I turn to the environment. There is no doubt that Gilmore is an icon in regard to its natural beauty, in beach, estuaries, lakes and rivers, mountains and dams. The Shoalhaven and Wingecarribee supply much of their water to Sydney—a very sensitive topic, I might add. The first, a very large effluent scheme, was instituted by Shoalhaven City Council, whereby the historical effluent discharge to the ocean was minimised by piping effluent outfall to 16 large farming properties. It is proving a real blessing during drought. Kiama municipality in Gilmore is looking at options to provide the same. I intend to assist with identifying possible sources of environmental funding for this and many other necessary environmental projects. Green Corp has been highly successful, both from the point of view of ridding our land of bitou bush, repairing sand dunes and bush regeneration. It has also been very successful in assisting some 3,000 young people in our electorate to learn skills, both in environmental studies and work ethics. Almost half of these young people have gone on to gain full-time employment.</para><para>This right of reply has allowed me to document our forward plan for Gilmore, one that I will vigorously pursue. I would like to publicly thank the three local government councils in Gilmore for their cooperative support, those being the Shoalhaven City Council, Wingecarribee Shire Council and Kiama Municipal Council. It is an honour and a pleasure to work with them in getting the job done in Gilmore.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>214</page.no><name role="metadata">Sawford, Rod, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SAWFORD</name><name.id>3J4</name.id><electorate>Port Adelaide</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last year, I had the pleasure of being involved in two elections, one in Australia and one in the United States. Despite all the commentary to the contrary throughout the year and indeed during both elections, neither were going to be line-ball elections. In the respective prevailing economic conditions in both countries there was simply no way Labor, the Democrats or John Kerry could win. However, it was absolutely fascinating to observe both academic and political commentary in both countries at first-hand. Most was and proved to be totally inaccurate and often inane. </para></talk.start><para>Political commentary in both countries has deteriorated yet again into a weak, pale laxative of largely synthesised nonsense bereft of proper analysis. Too many political academics and journalists appear to act out of a fear that they seem shaken by a recognition that they may have wasted their careers by not engaging in and observing the lives of people around them. That applies to some politicians too, but fewer than most people would think. More importantly, these people in the media and in academia seem to become wholly and totally intimidated at the prospect of an economic, cultural and communications revolution commencing and leaving them behind as irrelevant.</para><para>Since the end of World War II, there have been only five changes of government in 60 years. The 1949 election, which saw the re-emergence of Robert Menzies, was largely reported as an election won on petrol pricing and nationalisation of the banks. It was not. Both were factors, of course, but very minor factors. Labor lost because the economy was out of control, with interest rates rising, inflation rising and unemployment rising. The next change happened in 1972, the election which saw Gough Whitlam elected as Prime Minister of Australia. This was largely reported as a strategic masterpiece of campaigning with the `It's time' campaign. Wrong. In fact, the result was an underachievement. Labor won by only eight seats; it should have won by 16 to 25. There was a vast gap between the campaign and what actually happened on the ground. But again the economy was out of control with rising interest rates, rising inflation and rising unemployment.</para><para>The next change was in 1975. This election was largely reported as the Gough Whitlam dismissal election. Wrong. The economy was out of control with rising inflation, rising interest rates and rising unemployment. The next election in 1983 was largely reported as the Hawke rising star ascendancy. Wrong again. The economy was out of control, with rising interest rates, rising inflation and rising unemployment. Members opposite will remember they were all above 10 per cent—the trifecta of doom for any government. In 1996, the next change, the election was largely reported as the Keating downfall. Wrong again. The economy was out of control with rising interest rates—they went from 10 per cent to 10½ per cent. Inflation went from 1.2 per cent to 3.7 per cent, and even though the employment measurement mechanism changed everybody knew that unemployment was higher, although the figure was supposedly lower.</para><para>There are only three other elections of note. The 1961 election was fascinating. Interest rates went up, inflation went down and unemployment remained the same. Menzies, the incumbent, won by the narrowest margin—one seat. I remember it well. My father lost a week's wages to his father because, even though they both supported Labor, my grandfather was sure that Menzies would hang on by the barest margin, and he did. He has been correct every since. In 1990, interest rates rose from 15½ per cent to 17 per cent. Inflation, however, fell from 9.4 per cent to 8.6 per cent and unemployment fell from 7.8 per cent to 6.1 per cent. The incumbent, Hawke, won. It was never in doubt.</para><para>In 1993 we had the unlosable election—so called by so many commentators. What a nonsense! In 1993 unemployment was 10.9 per cent, but interest rates fell from 17 per cent to 10 per cent and inflation fell from 8.6 per cent to 1.2 per cent. Keating was never in any danger whatsoever. Hewson had no hope whatsoever. And 49 of the 51 members of the political press gallery got it spectacularly wrong. Only two got it right: Amanda Buckley and Laura Tingle. They are slow learners that lot, bereft of analytic skills, but we will keep it quiet; they get angry when you remind them. As United States Democratic Party Speaker Sam Rayburn said after Franklin D. Roosevelt's landslide 1936 win: </para><quote><para>When you get too big a majority, you're immediately in trouble.</para></quote><para>From 1975 onwards, Malcolm Fraser had effective control of the Senate; he blew it. Howard will have control from 1 July this year. There are but two basic options: control the economy, stop throwing money at undeserving groups and use the revenue to build the nation's skills, infrastructure and competitiveness; or blow the economy, as Howard did under Malcolm Fraser. If Howard controls the economy, there needs to be a balance between the public and private good. That prospect looks pretty poor, given the massive increase in subsidies to private health and private education in recent years and the continuing ratcheting up of subsidies. If Howard controls the economy, his government will need to invest in infrastructure to improve efficiencies in the economy and deliberately acquit high-skill, high-pay job dividends for the expenditure.</para><para>With the exception of the Alice Springs-Darwin railway—which, by the way, the government got right despite all the barking criticism of many in the eastern states—and, obviously, increased defence expenditure, there appears little evidence that Howard will increase infrastructure expenditure, AusLink included. If Howard controls the economy, he will need to balance his responses to the capital markets and not be intimidated by them, as so many of our state governments appear to be. If Howard is to control the economy, he will need to deliberately upgrade education and training to give the Australia of the future a highly skilled and competitive labour force. He won't. He never has and he never will. In the longer term, this inattention to building the nation's infrastructure and building the nation's skills base will lead to higher inflation and higher interest rates, and it will lead inevitably to the loss of government.</para><para>Immediately after the election, Senator Nick Minchin raised the issue of voluntary voting. The sycophants of the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, raised the issue of abortion. Both issues were raised in the context that they would divide the Australian community. Senator Minchin wants to diminish community participation in elections; that is clear to everyone. His methodology is divisive and he knows it. So too the abortion debate. If government members seriously wanted to do something positive, the topic would not be abortion; it would have been the prevention of unwanted pregnancies, as the member for Moore apparently stated in the coalition party room yesterday. This topic includes all good people of goodwill. The topic of abortion drags every lunatic in Australia into one room. Last year, to his credit, the Prime Minister dropped both of these issues—or so we thought. Abortion, in all its demented divisiveness, is now back, and the Prime Minister thinks it is deserving of debate.</para><para>What about voluntary voting? What about all those other divisive issues taking attention away from the main game: keeping the economy under control? Your guess is as good as mine, but just remember Democratic Party Speaker Sam Rayburn's words in 1936:</para><quote><para>When you get too big a majority, you're immediately in trouble.</para></quote><para>The elections in the United States and Australia, so similar in so many ways, lead us to ask some pertinent questions. What sort of country is Australia becoming? Is Australia becoming a country with a line between church and state that is inviolate? Is Australia becoming a country where religion trumps science? Is Australia becoming a country where leaders mobilise deep moral energies to divide us from each other and the world? Is Australia becoming a country that interferes with the rights of women to control their bodies? Is Australia becoming a country that intrudes into people's sexual preferences? Is Australia becoming a country where religious energy is used in politics to promote division and intolerance, and is that energy really on God's agenda? These are important questions. </para><para>I have always had the view, one that I note is shared by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, that your religious viewpoint ought to be private. In fact, one of the great strengths of the Australian democracy is that that belief is a basic tenet of our nation. People seem to forget that the overwhelming majority of religions in the world are not democratic—never have been and never will be. Nor are countries democratic when religions control the nation. Those points have no impact whatsoever on the right of all Australians to believe in and practice whatever faith they choose, but people do not have the right to interfere in the political process and to push their own particular morality on the rest of the population.</para><para>Good governments should insulate the Australian community from the economic shocks of interest rates, inflation and unemployment. Good governments should build on the skills base of the nation and invest in the necessary infrastructure to ensure our competitiveness into the future. And good governments should protect and insulate the Australian community from the loopy minorities that raise their heads from time to time. The current alliance with the fundamentalist religious Right is a case in point. It will, as it always does, end in tears, unnecessary anger and division and an overinflated sense of importance, taking the community backwards and wasting precious human energies.</para><para>The government is showing signs of losing control of the economy. Inflation is creeping up already. It always does when you fail to invest in infrastructure and a proper skills base. The same applies to rising interest rates. The current account deficit is fast approaching seven per cent, not the six per cent that has been quoted in the papers over the last couple of years. Personal debt in Australia is skyrocketing. The stock market is overvalued, as is the housing market. The economy as it is currently structured in Australia is simply not sustainable, and a judgment day and a shift correction is fast approaching. It has always been thus and it will prove to be the case yet again, catching out the greedy and those in debt—the rich and the poor—just as did past corrections in the 1890s, the thirties, the sixties, the eighties and so on. Corrections do not discriminate in favour of the forces of good or of evil in our community, more is the pity. The most vulnerable are always the worst affected. In the next few years those who have eliminated debt will be the only people in this country who will have the chance to ride out the massive correction when it arrives.</para><para>The Prime Minister is fast heading in the same direction he did when he was Treasurer to Malcolm Fraser. Control of the Senate did not help Malcolm Fraser; he wasted every opportunity that was presented to him. It may, similarly, not help John Winston Howard. In the next few years under the Howard government, Australians can look forward to rising interest rates on massive mortgages. A rise in the rate of just one per cent on mortgages of sometimes $200,000, $300,000 or $400,000 is a huge impost on families each month. Under the Howard government Australians can look forward to rising inflation—already happening—and lower wages. There is government activity already pushing in that area, too. </para><para>Under the Howard government Australians can look forward to rising unemployment and underemployment. In fact, it is this issue of underemployment that will become the real problem, more so than it is today. All of us are confronted on a daily basis by the number of people who come into our offices wanting to work 30 or more hours a week but who only have 10 or 15 hours a week or a fortnight and cannot get any more. In the meantime, when corrective economic action could have been taken, we will have a divided Australia talking up the merits or demerits of abortion, voluntary voting, the religious Right, private education and private health—in fact, any topic whatsoever that divides the Australian populous and takes us further from addressing the real problems and the challenges facing this country.</para><para>The world is changing dramatically. Hundreds of millions of people—at least 300 million in countries like China, India and Indonesia—in the next five years will assume higher skills and financial status. They will demand, as is their right, more manufactured goods, infrastructure expenditure and accommodation needs, and this is going to put enormous pressure on the price of fuel and resources—oil in particular. The American economy—the biggest economy in the world, 25 per cent of the world's economy—saved so often in the past by the spending patterns of US consumers, is I believe much more fragile than most people appreciate or realise. A withdrawal of investment from the US economy by the remainder of the world would have disastrous consequences, and for Australia too. The salient point to make is what I have described as probable and likely, not the opposite.</para><para>When individuals, groups or governments put their heads in the sand and play side games, as we are seeing at the moment, they usually get their rears kicked and their heads crunched. Dealing with side issues while ignoring the main game seems to be an increasing activity of the Howard government and its frontbench and backbench. Mind you, it has company in the world, with other countries doing exactly the same in their attempt to direct attention from the real problems of the nation. Mr Mahathir in Malaysia was, of course, an expert at this, and he often directed his anger at Australia when in fact he had problems in his own country. But I love this little example in North Korea. Do you know that in North Korea they are currently conducting a campaign against long hair? Probably facial hair too. In fact, North Korean state television warned that growing hair consumed a great deal of nutrition and could starve the brain.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Slipper</name></talker><para>—Is that your problem?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sawford, Rod, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SAWFORD</name></talker><para>—The latter comment—starving the brain—could equally apply to some of the actions of members of the coalition in recent months, including the member opposite.

In South Australia I am very fortunate in that I have perhaps the most active branch. Unlike a lot of FECs, we meet every month. We have a good time, and we have a good group of people. In our FEC, unlike some, you can say whatever you like. You can disagree with the federal member; you can disagree with anybody. You can actually participate, and you are encouraged to participate. That loyalty that those members give me is a great honour and a great privilege.

The sad part that we often do not acknowledge is that, in the meantime, millions of people have been very badly hurt in the process.

The new government always has the very difficult challenge of getting things back on a level again. To those people in Port Adelaide, there are some issues coming up that I hope to speak on from time to time, including the AusLink proposals.

His Excellency clearly articulated for us the steady progress of the government's economic reforms, the increased resilience of our national economy and our enviable position in the world as one of the stronger performing nations. His Excellency also profiled several of the many issues that will challenge the 41st Parliament. I would like to speak to some of those challenges and add a few thoughts of my own. I want to speak about the nature of the current conflict in which we find ourselves, which we call the war against terrorism, of the continuing violence against Aboriginal women and children, and of the contradiction in public policy terms between an ageing population and the depopulation of unborn children in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The war against terrorism is the name for the current conflict which engages the focus of our national security. For today's Australians, it is the challenge of our generation. It is fair to say that the vast majority of Australians reject ideas, political movements, events or incidents which appear to deny the most basic human rights to our fellow Australians, most especially when such ideas, political movements, events or incidents are also seen as totalitarian in nature. Totalitarianism can be explained as a regime in which the state or government controls nearly every aspect of the individual's life. According to Wikipedia, totalitarian governments do not tolerate activities by individuals or groups that are not directed at the regime's goals. Such regimes maintain themselves in power through any or all of the following: secret police, propaganda disseminated through the media, active exclusion of any open criticism of the regime and the use of violence and terror tactics. Internal and external threats are created to foster unity of the population through fear.</para><para>The term has been used to describe nationalist, imperialist, fascist or communist regimes. However, a common element is that such a regime is in direct conflict with the `free world' as we understand it. Such governments, regimes or movements that can be labelled totalitarian are marked by extreme brutality to its opponents. The ruling ideology demands that every aspect of an individual's life is subordinate to that of the regime; and this includes education, occupation, income, recreation and religion, even including family life and relationships. </para><para>Further, it is not a Left or Right issue. Stalin from the Left and Hitler from the Right were bitter enemies, but both ran totalitarian-like regimes. Their place on the political spectrum mattered not one whit to their citizenry, who existed in a state of terror and fear. Nor, it seems, is such a regime an aberration of Western civilisation. For example, Stalin, Mussolini, Hitler and Franco were later joined by Mao Zedong, Idi Amin, Pol Pot and Saddam Hussein, to name a few from Eastern traditions. Like today's Islamic radicals, and their soul brothers the Islamic terrorists, they all believed in the total state, the total doctrine and the total adherence of their populations to the movement.</para><para>These are some of the points that Paul Berman makes in his book published last year entitled <inline font-style="italic">Terror and Liberalism</inline>. He suggests that the philosophical foundations of today's Islamic suicide bomber have been drawn from the same pathological Western ideas that led to Stalin and Hitler. Berman points out that the only way in which Islamic terrorists differ from the totalitarianism of Western civilization is that the Islamic terrorists have been passed through an Islamic prism—a radical militant Islamic prism—and consequently the current war of terror against the West and its values is being waged through an extreme, religious Islamic world view.</para><para>The irony is that the philosophical roots of today's Islamic terrorist can be traced back to the anarchy of Lenin's totalitarianism that had developed into indiscriminate violence and mass terror. The terrorists imported these feral Western views, acquired in Western Europe, back to the Middle East and incorporated them into a new form of militant Islam that Berman terms Islamism. The policy implication in all this is that as a community we need to understand the nature of what we are fighting against when we speak of the war against terrorism. Our Australian Muslim and non-Muslim communities need to see that we are not simply fighting terrorism as some kind of opaque, confusing political movement.</para><para>The former US Secretary of the Navy and current member of the Kean Commission investigating the September 11 bombings, John Lehman, in his address to the US Naval Institute on 31 March 2003, said:</para><quote><para>We are currently in a war, but it is not a war on terrorism. In fact, that has been a great confusion, and the sooner we drop that term, the better. This would be like President Franklin Roosevelt saying in World War II “we are engaged in a war against kamikazes and blitzkrieg”. Like them, terrorism is a method, a tool, a weapon that has been used against us.</para></quote><para>He goes on to speak of `the emergence of a trans-national enemy driven by religious fervour and fanaticism' for which the US government was simply not prepared. He says:</para><quote><para>Our enemy is not terrorism. Our enemy is violent, Islamic fundamentalism. None of our government institutions was set up with receptors, or even vocabulary, to deal with this. So we left ourselves completely vulnerable to a concerted attack.</para></quote><para>Because Australia is a liberal democracy, with a considerable emphasis on individual freedoms and personal liberty, we will always be an anathema to such a religious fundamentalist movement that is totalitarian in nature. We are a living example of what it considers to be so terribly wrong. Only when we understand the totalitarian character of this radical religious phenomenon can we take appropriate steps to counter and repel its intolerance and aggression. We have to call it what it is; we have to understand its nature to allow us to develop an appropriate defence. </para><para>To secure our future in this increasingly uncertain world, we must no longer be tolerant of the intolerant. Clearly articulating the nature of the challenge encourages policies to implement appropriate government strategies and, far more importantly, to garner wider community understanding and support. As Australians, both Muslim and non-Muslim, we are against all those who would seek to derail, especially violently derail, our democratic institutions, our Australian values of a fair go for all, our religious and political freedoms and our tolerant, easy-going way of life.</para><para>In some ways, many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women live in fear of abuse in a kind of de facto totalitarian state that is marked by violence and isolation in remote communities in the very heartland of this democratic nation of ours. In June 2000, I spoke in this House about a war zone in Australia today. I was speaking in response to the report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women's Taskforce on Violence, chaired by Professor Bonnie Robertson from Queensland.</para><para>In the light of that report, I said that in some Indigenous communities violence and sexual abuse against women and children had reached a crisis point. While the source of this violence could be traced to the impact of history, with the consequences of dispossession, marginalisation, unemployment, alcoholism and poor education, it mattered little to the innocent women and children who were being bashed, raped, mutilated and murdered on an appallingly large scale. The Robertson report showed that many women, children and the elderly led a life that was a continuum of frequent mayhem and violence and that the women and children in particular were being deliberately ignored by those who had a duty to protect them.</para><para>In his address to this parliament, the Governor-General referred to the need to address family violence in Indigenous communities. I know that the government has made a determined effort to remedy the appalling state of affairs to which Professor Robertson drew attention. For example, the Family Violence Prevention Legal Services program will come on stream from March this year, with a total of 26 units operating Australiawide within the next four years. A further $22.7 million over four years has been committed by our government, and the units will be located predominately in rural and remote areas of high need.</para><para>However, despite this and other measures that have been implemented, it appears that the situation of women in rural and remote Indigenous communities has even worsened since the year 2000. According to Professor Robertson, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian </inline>newspaper in January this year, the problem is increasing. Professor Robertson says that we need to be addressing the causes rather than the consequences of family violence and identifies a growing sense of frustration all around. Others suggest that we should immediately address the consequences. Ideally, it should be both. But, when we come to a serious accident, first aid should be applied while we wait for the ambulance. So too with this problem. We should be tackling the immediate consequences while calling for the resources to deal with the causes.</para><para>I would like to see federal and state governments, the law enforcement agencies and particularly the courts emulate the British government's actions of enforcing the law against the sexual abuse of women and children on Pitcairn Island. The Pitcairn Island abuse occurred some years ago. If only Australian women in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities could get the justice that the women of Pitcairn have at last received. The key to doing this is the protection of women and children from reprisals if they do come forward to seek the justice that is due to them. </para><para>As a first step in providing such protection, there is a great need to provide more safe houses in isolated and remote communities, where women and children can find sanctuary from imminent danger. There also needs to be in place a dedicated transport arrangement to enable them to escape the immediate danger in their community and find longer term safety elsewhere. If non-Indigenous women have a need for and ready access to these facilities, then so too should Indigenous women in remote communities. Indigenous women have to have good cause to feel safe enough to come forward and to seek help and support. If this does not happen—and if the last five years are anything to go by—then in another five years time we will still be pouring tens of millions of dollars into a problem that remains a national shame.</para><para>One of the longstanding problems of Indigenous affairs is that the majority of rural, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women have been marginalised—not only in the governing of their own communities but also in exercising influence over the policies of successive governments. I believe there has been a watershed change to this problem, with the government's decision last year to close ATSIC and all that it represented; with the establishment of the National Indigenous Council, headed by magistrate Sue Gordon; and with the appointment of members to the NIC who, so far, appear to have a positive inclination to seeking solutions. It is long overdue and a welcome step in the right direction—towards destroying a total denial of their basic human right to live without fear and violence. This is a kind of cultural totalitarian way of life, if you like, wrought by circumstances of social breakdown, cultural dilution and marginalisation that is marked by rural isolation: a lack of individual rights and a powerlessness that has fed on our past indifference.</para><para>Australia is a wealthy country, a land of great opportunity and—for most of us—a land of great personal freedoms and expression. It is time that these Australian women shared in our freedom and prosperity. We must empower them by seeking their direction on their needs and ensuring that their requests are delivered. I look forward to the full implementation of the new legislation and to some positive outcomes from the new council that will impact in a meaningful way on the tragic lives of these Australian women and children.</para><para>I now refer to recent interest in and call for a debate on abortion, raised by those who are uncomfortable with the high number of abortions and the reports of women suffering from post abortion trauma, and who have recognised that some scientific and technological developments over the last decade are raising legitimate questions about abortion that previously did not exist.</para><para>The issue of the high number of abortions each year—whatever that high number is—is also relevant to our future population profile, which in turn has implications for our future prosperity. Australia has a birth rate of 1.7 per woman, which is below the population replacement level of 2.1 births per woman. Australia's welfare system was developed when the proportion of our over 65 years of age population was much lower than it is today. This is of serious concern to those who would ensure our economic sustainability and our future prosperity.</para><para>To this end, long-term government policy has spent millions of dollars on our immigration program and more recent policy has aimed at providing a $3,000 contribution to assist new mothers with their babies. Excluding medical terminations, if most of the 70,000 or more abortions of choice in Australia each year were not performed, this would have a significant and beneficial impact on the demographic and economic outlook for Australia. On the one hand there is hand wringing about our critically low birth rate while on the other hand there is the government subsidy of abortion of choice. This represents a conflict in public policy, to say the least. </para><para>Abortion is not an academic issue for me. As a young mother with three children under three, I was presented with serious medical reasons for not continuing with a fourth, unexpected pregnancy. I know the darkness of that deep emotional abyss. I exercised my free-will choice, but I continued with the pregnancy. I support the free-will choice of all women to make their own decision between an abortion and a baby. It is not for men or governments to take that free-will choice away.</para><para>Australia is a free, liberal democracy. We have a birthright to make our own decisions on such personal matters because we each have to live with the consequences of those decisions. But—with the exception of medical terminations, and stepping aside from the deep emotional aspects of this subject—we can clinically observe in abortions of choice, at the very least, a lifestyle choice and, at the very worst, the most brutal form of contraception.</para><para>When one appreciates that contraceptives are readily accessible and relatively inexpensive today—and if the figures of between 70,000 and 95,000 abortions annually in Australia are anywhere near correct—and allows for a percentage of preventative measures that may fail, that still leaves a lot of women and men who are not taking responsibility for their sexual activity. So one could well ask: why should the Australian taxpayer? In this scenario, such abortions of choice are a service of choice and should, appropriately, be self-funded by the user.</para><para>From my inquiries it appears that abortion clinics charge around $500 for an abortion. The mother contributes around $180 and presents her Medicare card. The balance of $27.2 million—that figure, of course, is annualised—is paid for by the Australian taxpayer. However, any reform of Medicare funding for an abortion should at least require that independent, factual information and alternatives are provided to the woman when taxpayer dollars are spent. In this way the taxpayer can be assured that such funding is truly being spent on a woman's health needs and on giving her an informed choice of all her options.</para><para>I make this point because I have a group of women in my electorate who are in a desperate situation, not of their choice or making, and they are struggling. They are struggling to bring up special needs children or support special needs young adults, and the resources from governments have been drying up progressively over many years. Many of these women are struggling alone because the fathers could not cope and walked away and left them with the job. Many do not get sufficient respite. Many have surrendered career opportunities. Many are lonely. Many live below the poverty line. Such is the life of a carer today. All of these women are acutely aware of a great unmet need for services, for education, for occupational training, for accommodation, for respite, for educational services for their family members—and I could go on. When they gather the strength to approach governments they are always told there is no funding available for them. Yet we do have funding for those who freely choose to avail themselves of an abortion when many of them could also freely choose to take other preventative measures. </para><para>As I said before, I leave the choice about an abortion to the free will of the pregnant woman. But her free-will choice should be an informed free-will choice and should be based upon up-to-date information. She should also have the widest possible range of alternatives for her consideration when she makes that choice. Medical science knows so much more today about the development of the foetus than it did 10 years ago. A foetus can no longer be dismissed as a disposable piece of human tissue. Modern technology is increasingly informing the layperson that the human foetus has its own genetic identity and its own cerebral activity. It has an independent heartbeat, an independent circulatory system. A human foetus can grab and hold on to the finger of an operating surgeon. Another development is that medical science is helping premature babies to survive at an earlier stage.</para><para>I do support the efforts of Senators Boswell and Santoro to seek comprehensive data and up-to-date information on the number of abortions and on any negative psychological or other detrimental health outcomes that have been experienced by women after an abortion, so that governments can offer appropriate support services. It is of some concern to learn of an increase in post-abortion depression amongst women who have been traumatised by the experience of an abortion. Anecdotal evidence from consulting psychologists indicates that some women are not getting the appropriate counselling before they undergo such an operation. It is clear that greater and credible research to this special area of woman's health is imperative. Such research and data is not only necessary to inform governments in the provision of appropriate support services but also to inform and empower a woman in making her own choice.</para><para>The issues I have raised today are very current issues which are of concern to most Australians. They touch on our national security, our responsibility to our Indigenous sisters and their children, the quirkiness of our population policy and the special plight of those exceptional Australians who care for family members with special needs. As the Governor-General said:</para><quote><para>... Australia stands on the threshold of a new era of national achievement. With renewed energy and purpose, the government rededicates itself to the great ideals of the Australian nation and to the service of the Australian people.</para></quote><para>His Excellency concluded his address by saying that our nation is a leading example of democratic freedom, institutional stability and economic wellbeing. For those of us here, it is our job to keep it that way and to use our best endeavours to ensure that such values are shared equally with all the people of Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>224</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Firstly, I want to welcome you, Mr Deputy Speaker McMullan, on your accession to the Speaker's panel.

And the member for Fraser well knows that it was my view on the Friday when he was given the nod by the previous leader of the opposition as shadow Treasurer that I thought it was great that a level of professionalism would be brought back to that position. However, that was not to be. That is past history, but the future may hold other things for both of us. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Today I will speak in a somewhat unusual way. Normally I speak off-the-cuff but today, in my speech in the address-in-reply debate, I am going to refer to notes. I hope to mount an argument which will give the lie not only to what the Prime Minister has been putting about in question time—in particular, yesterday's question time—but also to what he has been putting about after the election, in the address-in-reply debate and in the election campaign. The fundamental context of my speech is the fact that the government won the election. It did so, in good part, because of the arguments it put in regard to interest rates. The government felt it had a convincing case—and certainly many people in the community thought so—compared to Labor's.</para><para>Even since being elected to the Speaker's panel, I have often interjected in question time during the Prime Minister's arguments that this coalition government's performance—and the performance of all coalition governments—in relation to the economic indicators for inflation, unemployment and interest rates has always been better than Labor's. I am here to give the lie to that today. As you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker McMullan, from your past experience in the Hawke-Keating government, that is simply not true; it is incorrect to argue that. The Prime Minister does it, though, day after day. Of course, he has form on a number of matters, but he also has the signal distinction of being the only Treasurer in the more than 100-year history of the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia who has achieved the trifecta of double-digit unemployment, a double-digit interest rate and a double-digit inflation rate. Noone else has had those three indicators go so badly. Other people have had recessions. There was the 198283 recession, responsibility for which we lay at the very door of the then Treasurer, John Howard, the member for Bennelong. He is the person who was responsible for running Australia's economy at that time.</para><para>Everyone here should remember and have imprinted on their memory the depth and extent of that recession and the amount of time we took to dig ourselves out of that during the Hawke-Keating period. But they should also have imprinted on their memory the three figures pegged up on boards around Australia in January 1983. Unemployment was at 10.1 per cent. Who was the Treasurer? John Howard, the member for Bennelong. Inflation was at 11 per cent. Who was the Treasurer? The member for Bennelong. And then there is the housing loan interest rate—a key issue not only in the last election but also yesterday in question time when the Prime Minister again averred that the coalition has always been better than the Labor Party on interest rates and would always have lower interest rates. He also argued in the propaganda campaign put out during the election campaign that, over a period of 30 years, interest rates have always risen to more than 10 per cent under Labor. In January 1983 the coalition was in power and had been in power since December 1975. Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister and John Howard, the member for Bennelong, was Treasurer; he had taken over from the late Phillip Lynch. The interest rate was 13.5 per cent. Under the coalition, the average for that year was 13.1 per cent.</para><para>The Prime Minister argued only yesterday that Labor had always had higher interest rates. What is the comparator? In the Parliamentary Library, which is at least non-partisan in regard to this, there is a very interesting comparison. Let us remember that interest rates under the Hawke government went to 17 per cent at their highest point. Under the Keating government, they went to 12 per cent at their highest point. John Howard, as Treasurer, achieved 13.5 per cent. But what did they achieve over the life of the government— </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LN6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name></talker><para>—It is a simple comparison. The Whitlam government, parodied by this Prime Minister and hacked to pieces by ministers from this government, averaged a housing interest rate of 9.16 per cent. Over its two terms, the three years it was in power—harried from one end of the Commonwealth to the other by a coalition baying for its blood and doing everything they could to try to stop it from governing—that government achieved an average interest rate of 9.16 per cent.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What was the interest rate under the Fraser government in toto? It was 10.66 per cent. Is it true, as the Prime Minister averred yesterday, that under Labor interest rates are always higher than they are under a coalition government? The answer is no, that is not the case. What was it, though, if you take just John Howard's period as Treasurer? It was a failed, miserable record in so many regards. What was the interest rate? It was 10.94 per cent. That is just under 11 per cent as an average across his total period as Treasurer.</para><para>We will be honest enough to put the comparatives in over the period of the Hawke-Keating government and say that over the life of the government the interest rate was 12.84 per cent. I can readily and strongly argue that there is a conditioning situation and a larger context there. We, coming into government, came in at the end of a period where the economy had been poleaxed by Treasurer John Howard and where the country had been driven into deep recession. In part, this was because of the madness of Prime Minister Fraser, who thought there was going to be a massive resources boom and talked it up through 1980 and 1981. Instead, we had a massive increase in unemployment and fundamental structural problems in the economy that had not been addressed for a number of years and we ended up with an average rate of 12.84 per cent over the life of the government.</para><para>But we were also shackled by something else that is extremely noteworthy. If you look at the current account deficit for the period of January-February it is 4.7 per cent of GDP. That is a significant weight on the government's operations. If you look at John Howard's history, in February 1983 there was 10.7 per cent unemployment, up 0.6 of one per cent; there was 11 per cent inflation; and housing interest rates were at 12½ per cent. That was a trifecta of the very worst economic indicators you could have, with a current account deficit of 4.7 per cent of GDP.</para><para>There was something else that we need to remark on and to underline that conditioned how the Hawke-Keating government, particularly in its early years, dealt with the economy and the problems of trying to restructure it. The member for Fraser well remembers, as do I, that in the week before the 1983 election Treasurer John Howard was asked publicly what the deficit figure would be for the Commonwealth budget at that time. I think it was the Tuesday before the election when he was first asked that. He demurred significantly, but eventually coughed up a figure of $4.6 billion as the deficit in prospect on the advice that he had been given. On the Friday before the election—one single day before the March 1983 election which brought Bob Hawke and the Labor Party to power—Treasurer John Howard, the member for Bennelong, was forced to concede that the $4.6 billion figure he had uttered was not correct. He corrected the record and he said it was closer to $6 billion. Mr Deputy Speaker McMullan, you know and I know that when he uttered the $4.6 billion figure and the $6 billion figure he did not tell the truth, because the reality was that the advice that he got from Treasury was that the deficit looming for the federal budget was $9.6 billion in March 1983 figures. That is a significant amount of weight, you would think, to take on—that budget deficit for one single year. Given all those other economic indicators which were so bad and which no Treasurer before had ever racked up—three double-digit figures—the impact of that deficit on the economy and on the management of the economy was significant. </para><para>What is that $9.6 billion in today's dollars? That $9.6 billion figure has been thrown around in past elections. Something close to that was said just a couple of elections ago by Treasurer Costello. If we actually look at the impact of what that would be in today's dollars, that $9.6 billion would in fact be $35 billion. That would be $35,000 million added to the deficit that the Commonwealth faced in just one simple year. So when the Hawke-Keating government came into power in March 1983 and opened the books, what did they find? What the member for Bennelong said on Tuesday—a $4.6 billion deficit—was false. What he said on Friday—`It was not $4.6 billion; it was closer to $6 billion'—was knowingly false. That $9.6 billion in those dollars is equivalent to $35 billion now.</para><para>Getting up and over that economic hurdle, attempting to restructure an economy that was effectively a basket case, having to deal just three short years later with the cumulative effect and then the one-off effect of a situation where Australia faced a decline in its terms of trade over a 30-year period of one half of a per cent to one per cent per year to, within the period of one month, having a 25 per cent fall in Australia's terms of trade—these were significant and, indeed, unexampled problems facing any treasurer and any government. But manfully and properly, Treasurer Keating, Prime Minister Hawke and the Labor ministry that the member for Fraser was a part of stuck to the job, saw it through and refashioned, under the impetus of what happened in 1986, the economy.</para><para>So dramatically did they refashion Australia's economic infrastructure, substructure and indeed superstructure—to borrow a series of phrases from someone who is buried in Highgate cemetery in London—and so significantly did they change the way in which things are done here that the breaking of the back of inflation in 1990-91, and the low inflationary period that has been in evidence since then, is the key reason why the figures for the affordability of housing or affordability of interest rates for the Howard prime ministership and the Howard government from March 1996 are comparatively good. Certainly they are comparatively good compared to those of Treasurer Howard, a disaster in so many respects and a fundamental failure.</para><para>The member for Bennelong could build on the back of the structural work done by the Hawke-Keating government. He could not build on the back of his own work when he was Treasurer to Prime Minister Fraser. So in this situation we have got a very simple comparison. Even the Whitlam government—so badly spoken of by members of this government—had a better record on housing interest rates than the member for Bennelong did as the Treasurer in the Fraser government. Indeed, if you look at the current Howard government from 1996 until now, there is the Whitlam government standing at 9.16 per cent and what is the average for interest rates under a Howard government operating in a completely changed economic environment building on the back of what had been achieved in our 13 years of government? It is 7.2 per cent—still relatively high and not all that far from the rest. But the key point is it has only been able to be achieved because the back of inflation was broken and a low interest rate regime and a low growth-low inflation rate regime was introduced into Australia, and we simply had not had those conditions for decades, since the early 1950s. So you can do a great deal if you simply ride on the back of that. </para><para>But there is a lot that is not just riding on the back of that. When we are dealing with comparators where you cannot trust what this Prime Minister will say in comparing his government's achievements with what he regards as deficits from former Labor governments—and I think I have just given the lie to what he said in the parliament yesterday and what he argued during the election campaign—if you look at some other indicators you could argue that having a look at interest rates over the life of a parliament is not really the best way to do it because you might not take into account a whole series of factors: when people came to government, what the business cycles were, what the general economic cycles were and what the major movements were worldwide.</para><para>If, however, instead of looking at pure interest rates you looked at home loan affordability as another measure and did a comparison in that regard, you would find something quite different, and that has been done. The Real Estate Institute of Australia and AMP Banking did that and they came up with an average home loan affordability ratio under Hawke and Keating of 39.6. With this figure the higher the number, the better you are doing. You would imagine, given the coalition's argument, that they would have an extremely high number and that they would have well outperformed the Hawke and Keating governments in terms of home loan affordability—particularly with a 7.2 per cent interest rate regime over the life of the government. The reality is that their number is 39.4. They have underperformed the Hawke-Keating governments throughout the whole cycle of the government in terms of home loan affordability.</para><para>When the Prime Minister says, `Interest rates under Hawke went up to 17 per cent,' under the member for Bennelong they went up to 13.5 per cent in January 1983. Take into account that in 1989, when those interest rates were running at 17 per cent, the average home loan was $66,700. Also take into account that just less than one year later the Hawke government was reelected for a fourth time, despite the fact that interest rates were so high, because actual home loan affordability was there. What people did not readily appreciate—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Government members interjecting</inline><inline font-style="italic">—</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LN6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name></talker><para>—I know you do not understand this and that it is really beyond you. You would not have understood the other fundamental point: that whatever the level of interest rates is—13.5 per cent in January 1983 under Treasurer Howard or 17 per cent in 1989—there is also another indicator you take into account and that is the level of inflation at that particular time. You end up doing a subtraction with a real interest rate, and the fundamental is the real interest rate that people are facing. We do that all the time. The Reserve Bank does it when it looks at home and housing affordability here and when it looks also at what the interest rate regime is here and what the settings for that should be and what the comparators are when you look at the key economy to drive this, the United States. We have always been in a position, in having to get money in from overseas, that we have set our interest rates higher than they have been in the United States because of the need to attract people and to have a higher set of interest rates to do so. In 1996, when Labor left office and housing interest rates were at 10½ per cent, the average housing loan was $99,100 and the repayments were $883 a month. In 2004, the average housing loan is $213,600. That is an average repayment of $1,523 at the current housing interest rate of 7.1 per cent. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I said at the start that I would actually read this speech. I have not; I have spoken off-the-cuff again, so I suppose I have broken that promise. But the core point here is that in this speech I have given the lie to the Prime Minister's argument that housing interest rates are always better under the coalition than under Labor. It is actually the reverse, and even the Whitlam government beat him.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>229</page.no><name role="metadata">Elson, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs ELSON</name><name.id>6K6</name.id><electorate>Forde</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This debate is a great opportunity to reflect on the achievements of the Howard government and to discuss our comprehensive agenda for our fourth term. Serving in this place has always been a great honour, but serving as part of the Howard government has been an absolute privilege. I was very fortunate to be part of the first wave, so to speak, having been elected by the people of Forde in 1996. The world and our nation have certainly faced many challenges since then. When I delivered my maiden speech in this place in April 1996 we were a nation suffering the aftershocks of the dreadful Port Arthur massacre. At that time the Prime Minister acted swiftly to introduce national gun control laws to help make our community a safer place.</para></talk.start><para>As the last parliament gathered, the world was still coming to terms with the events of September 11 and the implications for all free nations. Once again the Prime Minister acted decisively to ensure that we have a leading role in the worldwide effort to defend against and defeat terrorism. We have remained steadfast in our resolve to help create a safer, more stable future for Australians and the world. Our resolve was further strengthened by the tragic terrorist bombings in Bali in October 2002, in which so many of our fellow countrymen lost their lives. Our involvement in overthrowing Saddam Hussein has delivered democracy to the people of Iraq, and it continues to be an integral part of the war on terror. Once again our government have never wavered. While others were advocating a withdrawal, we were determined to stay there the full course. The tremendous turnout and the obvious excitement at the recent Iraq elections have vindicated our belief that freedom is worth fighting for.</para><para>Now, tragically, as this parliament is just beginning, our nation and the world are facing yet another challenge—the most devastating natural disaster in our history. The tsunami which devastated entire coastal areas of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and parts of Africa and many, many islands in between has left an indelible mark on the world. The human cost in terms of lives lost is just staggering. The enormous task of rebuilding shattered communities seems almost insurmountable. Again, as the world came together to meet this challenge, Australia has been at the forefront by leading relief efforts and setting new benchmarks with our financial commitment. Once again our government, under the strong leadership of the Prime Minister, have acted decisively in the face of a very difficult challenge.</para><para>It is this sort of leadership that has won the respect and trust of the Australian people. As I did after the 2001 elections, I want to thank the Prime Minister for the great judgment and character he has shown over the past nine years. The Prime Minister has withstood enormous pressure and, at times, ridicule. He has always held strongly to what he believes in, and his desires to do what is in the national interest have always been evident in everything that he says. Anyone knows him behind the scenes, as the people on this side of the House in government do, would see that he is a genuine man who has it in his heart to make sure that he does the right thing by Australia. It is that tenacity and the fact that he remains true to his beliefs that has endeared him to Australians from all walks of life and has even won him begrudging respect from the left-wing media who irrationally dislike him. </para><para>I have been delighted to host many visits from the Prime Minister in my electorate over my time in parliament, and the feedback has always been hugely positive. I can say with certainty that they like him in the electorate of Forde. On behalf of the people of Forde, I thank the Prime Minister for his leadership of our nation, and I certainly look forward to welcoming him back to our local area in the course of this parliament. Today I also take this opportunity to reaffirm my commitment to the people of the Forde electorate. Having lived in our local area for 28 years and having worked closely with our community both before and after entering parliament, I have a deep commitment to our special place in south-east Queensland. My husband, David, and I have raised our eight children in Forde. They are now a very important part of our local community—members of schools, P&amp;Cs and sporting clubs—and our grandchildren are now growing up there and attending local schools. I remain motivated by my desire to seek a better deal for our region, to help local communities and small businesses reach their full potential and to ensure local residents have the best quality of life. That is the bottom line and the reason that I do this job.</para><para>While much has been achieved, there is still a lot more that I have to do. Unfortunately the state government have neglected many services within my region. They have understaffed the Logan Hospital. They have cut services at the Beaudesert Hospital. They have failed to match our funding increases for local state schools. They have failed to put in place truth in sentencing to deal with crime. They have failed to protect our children at risk. They have also failed to do anything about securing our future water supplies in Queensland. In contrast, our government have stepped up to the plate. We have established an after-hours clinic to reduce pressure on our emergency department at the Logan Hospital, which is a public hospital. We have increased funding for local state government schools. We have spent $30.2 million over the past three years in Forde just to improve facilities. We have introduced the Community Crime Prevention Program to give local communities the opportunity to work with police and to help reduce crime, and it is working. We have established the $2.1 billion Australian Water Fund to really tackle water supply and its usage issues.</para><para>The thing is that Labor have always spent a lot of time talking about health, education and the environment, but those words are never backed up by what they do in office at either the state or the federal level. That is the real difference between a government of action and an opposition just of words. We are hands-on and we remain accessible to the Australian people, while Labor squabble amongst themselves. Over the past nine years, many ministers have come to my electorate to talk with our local residents and to listen to their concerns and their ideas. It has been a hallmark of this government that we have never taken our position for granted. We have made a conscious decision to remain in touch and to take a hands-on approach rather than leave the decision making to public servants. We have not forgotten the lessons of Labor's 13 years in office—how out of touch they became with the Australian people and how they lost sight of the hopes and the aspirations of the battlers they had previously claimed to represent.</para><para>In contrast, the Howard government have kept faith with the mainstream Australians that we represent. I believe that the large class of `96 and their members have led the way to this approach. Collectively, we believe in getting out there, being part of the community and listening to and working with our local residents with a real community based approach to politics that Labor has either forgotten or abandoned. I am delighted that our approach has been backed up over the past three years by the class of 2001. Now we have this great class that have just entered. They are brimming with new ideas, enthusiasm and energy, and I am quite sure they are here for the long haul. I take this opportunity to congratulate and welcome our new members and wish each of them well. It certainly augurs well for our government that our members continue to come from a diverse range of real-world backgrounds: police, business, community service and, of course, academia. </para><para>It makes you wonder if Labor are really taking any notice, because it is very telling that once again in Werriwa Labor are looking at endorsing a former trade union official as their candidate. It seems abundantly clear that Labor have not yet learnt the lessons of the 1996 election, let alone 1998, 2001 or 2004. Deep down many Labor members still regard the last three election results as some sort of aberration, crediting the extent of the last loss to being largely due to the personal shortcomings of the former member for Werriwa. At least at the last election they paid lip-service to the need for fundamental change in the ALP and the member for Hotham then tried his best to get some sort of reform happening, but it was very marginal at its best. This time around there have been a few months of navel gazing and infighting, and this now has all been brushed aside amid calls for unity. The new leadership of the member for Brand proves again that he does not have the ticker to make these difficult decisions. Not one single member of Latham's frontbench has been replaced or changed.</para><para>The difference between the government and the Labor opposition is quite stark. The Australian public recognises them. Of course, the biggest difference at the last election was the issue of economic management. The coalition's track record of strong economic growth, low interest rates, low inflation and job growth in the uncertain international climate was well understood and well recognised by the Australian public. In contrast, Labor offered a cobbled together tax policy with figures that did not add up. They described the $600 per child parenting payment as `not real'. They proposed a change to health care that would have blown the budget.</para><para>Further, they had a history in opposition—including during the first, long six years under the current Leader of the Opposition—of opposing every tough decision the government made to bring about the economic conditions we all now enjoy. The Australian people are not silly: they looked at what was on offer and saw a very stark contrast between the government and the Labor opposition—a contrast based not solely on what Labor had done nine years ago while in office but on what they were offering now. Of course, the track record of Labor in government remains very relevant throughout. What makes it especially relevant is that it appears Labor have not learnt from anything at all in the past. I was astounded to hear that the member for Brand, during one of his first interviews as the opposition leader, on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Sunrise</inline> program, declared, `We were very good at running the economy when we were in office.'</para><para>Clearly, either Labor are desperately trying to fool the Australian public by rewriting history or they truly believe it. They have not learnt a thing. And, to be honest, I do not know which is more frightening. Does the member for Brand truly believe that it was good to push interest rates to 17 per cent, to have unemployment up above 10 per cent and to run up more than $96 billion in debt, not to mention small business interest rates of 24 per cent? Who could really stay in business and who could really employ people under those conditions? Does he really think that that was good economic management to have budget after budget where he promised a surplus but ended up delivering a huge deficit? If he truly does, there is a really clear point of difference between us and them because we do not think that high interest rates, high unemployment, successive budget deficits and massive government debt constitute good economic management. </para><para>As one of the many Australians who were struggling to raise a family and who only kept the family home by taking out a huge second mortgage, I can tell the member for Brand that he is not going to get very far trying that line, as we remember what it was really like. Importantly, our kids who were growing up then and who now own their own homes which they are paying off also remember. As I said at the outset, today I reaffirm my very strong personal commitment to the people of Forde. I will continue to take a hands-on approach with my open days and community newsletters. I will be out there speaking with local residents and I will be down here knocking on ministerial doors to make sure that we get what is needed in our electorate.</para><para>I would like to take the time I have left in this speech to briefly thank the many people who helped ensure that I would be returned here today by keeping up their fight. Firstly, I thank the voters of Forde once again for their confidence in me. I was very humbled to get such a phenomenal swing, close to seven per cent, in my fourth term. After a redistribution I was expected to reduce my margin. When I first stood for the seat the margin was notionally 0.1 per cent Liberal and we have built that margin over the four elections to 13.7 per cent. It is a testament to the working relationship I have with my community, and I will continue to work hard to repay that trust. My electorate includes the rural townships of Boonah, Beaudesert, Rathdowney and the beautiful area of Tamborine Mountain and the Kooralbyn district, the growing semirural suburbs of Jimboomber and Logan Village and the suburban areas of Eagleby, Loganlea, Beenleigh and Bethania, fast-growing Gold Coast areas including Coomera, and of course the dozens of small towns and regions in between. Each area has its unique needs and challenges, and I will continue to work with local residents to meet those particular challenges.</para><para>I was extremely heartened by the many offers of help and the support I received throughout my campaign from local residents, some of whom are party supporters and many of  whom are not. To my huge army of volunteers who worked on polling day manning 50 different booths—once again, too many people to mention; over 500 people came out to work on that day—I thank each and every one of you. I am here because of your help and support. A very heartfelt thanks to you and to the campaign committee, especially Chairman John Wallerstein, who has been a rock over many years for my campaign. To my campaign director, Selma: you continue to amaze us. What a talent! You earned the respect of many. Once again, I was fortunate to have a fantastic group of office volunteers who helped my staff in many ways. To Jerry, John, Gwendolyn, Barry and Eve and to the others who have given their time throughout the years, I thank you most sincerely.</para><para>I also want to thank and acknowledge my staff, all of whom do a great job and who worked very long hours for me and continue to do so. Thanks for all the extra effort and thoughtfulness that you displayed during the campaign. I could not ask for better staff. For me to be standing here today is the result of a huge team effort, and I thank every member of my team. Of course, my closest team and greatest cheer squad is my own special family, and I would like to take the time to mention them also. I know it is getting to the point where I will need 20 minutes just to name them all, but I will give it a go. To Selma and Andrew, Kellie and Stuart, Bill and Tracey, Eddie and Sam, George and Kristy, Johllene and Nev, Talena and Heath: without you I would not be standing here today. </para><para>To my 14 beautiful grandchildren, whom I will not name: you make life worth while. My wonderful husband is my love and my never-ending support—he does all the work. Finally, I again express my pride at being part of the government and of this parliament. The challenging times we find ourselves in place a big responsibility on each of us. I know our government will continue to get on with the job of governing in the national interest and delivering a better future to all Australians. Once again, I welcome and congratulate the new members of this House, and I look forward to a productive and positive new parliament.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>233</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to start, in this address-in-reply debate, by thanking the people of Ballarat for putting their faith in me again for a second term. It is a pretty humbling experience to put yourself forward in the context of a federal election, and I really do thank them for their support but also pledge to them that I will not let them down. I will certainly continue to work as hard as I can to improve the circumstances for people in my district. People in my district are not wealthy. For the people in my district, the average household income is around $34,000 a year—I wish it were $34,000 a week; it would be quite extraordinary to have an electorate of that sort of standing. As I said, it is quite a humbling experience to go before them and try and make sure that the policies we have in place are what are needed to make their circumstances better. I certainly think the last election showed that the people of Ballarat are awake to some of the messages that are coming from the Howard government and they have a pretty cynical attitude to some of the things that they are being told by this government.</para></talk.start><para>I particularly also want to thank my campaign team. I do not wish to name all of them individually because there are some other issues I want to talk about here. But I appreciate all of the efforts of the campaign team, my campaign director and my staff, who work incredibly hard and often under pretty tough and demanding circumstances. I also particularly appreciate all of the volunteers—all of those ALP members, supporters and their families and my own family—that do such incredible work getting out to the polling booths, stuffing envelopes and just making sure that life keeps ticking over and that I keep sane. Thank you.</para><para>This government has prided itself on its economic record over its term in government. Like all political parties it has attempted to claim credit for the elements of the economy that are going well and to shift blame for the elements of the economy that are not going so well. That is Marketing 101. But good economic growth does not just happen; it does not just appear out of thin air. You have to build it on a solid foundation and, once that foundation is set, you have to maintain it and manage it. The hidden story of the Howard government's economy is that it did not build the foundations of the good economy we are experiencing; Labor did. Only Labor was able to reach agreement between industry, the states and territories and the union movement to deregulate the Australian economy. We did not always get it right, but we had the courage, the foresight and the determination to build the foundations of the Australian economy that we are benefiting from now.</para><para>The other part of the economic story is that the Howard government has, in the last few years, begun to squander the economic legacy it was left and it has taken its eye off the ball in terms of where Australia's next round of economic growth will come from—and that is a worrying trend. I want to take trade for example. Yesterday the trade minister challenged us to compare Labor's record on trade with the Howard government's record. We did, and it shows that, under Labor, exports grew by an annual rate of 8.1 per cent compared to 3.6 per cent under the Howard government. Under Labor, manufactured exports averaged an annual growth of 11.5 per cent for five years to 1996. Under the Howard government, they have averaged 3.2 per cent for the five years to 2003. Under Labor, services exports averaged an annual growth of 11.7 per cent for the years to 1996. Under the Howard government, services exports averaged a growth of only 4.8 per cent for the five years to 2003. </para><para>Under Labor, Australia's global share of trade peaked at 1.22 per cent in 1989. Under the Howard government, Australia's share of global trade has declined to 0.98 per cent in 2003. Under Labor, net exports consistently made a positive contribution to economic growth. Under the Howard government, net exports have made a negative contribution to economic growth for the past three years. The Howard government, rather than delivering sustained economic growth, has delivered the 38th trade deficit in a row. The government has been coasting along for nine years without a plan to tackle trade and current account deficits.</para><para>In the second of his series of so-called headland speeches in the leadup to the 1996 election, the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, said:</para><quote><para>The $2.9 billion current account deficit figure for May was not only bad news in itself but symbolised the utter failure of current policies to address the problem.</para></quote><para>Today, under the stewardship of John Howard and Peter Costello, the current account deficit has risen to $13.7 billion. Then it was $2.9 billion and the then opposition leader, John Howard, was saying, `bad news in itself but symbolises the utter failure of current policies to address the problem'. Today it is $13.7 billion. In that same headland speech the then Leader of the Opposition said:</para><quote><para>When I left office, net foreign debt stood at a manageable $23 billion. Today our foreign debt burden is crippling $167 billion. That's nearly $10,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia.</para></quote><para>Under the stewardship of this government and the same person who spoke those words in 1996, our foreign debt has risen to $406 billion. So, according to the preferred formula that the Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition, used, it is well over $20,000 for every man, woman and child. Far from being strong on economic policy, the Howard government's performance smacks of laziness and complacency. The reality of the record of the Howard government is that it has produced record foreign debt; record current account deficits; record trade deficits; record household debt; record credit card debt; a record election spending spree, without the savings to fund it; a record low proportion of first home buyers in the market; and a record tax take as the highest taxing government in our history. The economic credentials of this government are yet another of the tales that it likes to tell about itself. The reality of the Howard government's economic laziness is being felt by families. They are paying record taxes, with what is the highest taxing government in our history, but they are receiving less by way of services and are under increasing debt.</para><para>Much of the growth in the economy has been driven by consumer spending and high levels of debt, and frankly it is just not sustainable. Retail figures released last week have shown that households are reining in their spending because many families have reached the limit of their spending and are trying to consolidate their budgets. The September quarter financial accounts revealed that household debt in Australia stands at a record $818 billion, and debt as a proportion of household income continues to rise. As a percentage of disposable household income, household debt is now a record high of 154.7 per cent, up from 85.5 per cent in March 1996. Household debt in Australia is among the highest in the developed world, which means even a small percentage increase in interest rates will create financial hardship for many families. </para><para>Some of the debts are a direct result of government policy. I, like many members of the House, have had numerous complaints about the family tax benefit system. Under the current system, many families each year have been slugged with debts or have had payments clawed back at tax time or they have not received the benefit of the payments they were told they would receive. The government's refusal to correct the family payment system, which cannot pay families the right amount when they need it, limits parents' ability to balance work and family. Increasing family payments for some families, without fixing the flaws in the system, has resulted in this money being clawed back at tax time or their not receiving the full benefit of the announcements.</para><para>On top of a family tax system that places people into debt, the government has also been increasing the amount of money people pay for services. The GST clearly increased the cost of basic goods and services but there have been additional rises. The so-called reforms to Medicare, which I do not think are sustainable in terms of the safety net, from the health budget's point of view—but we will live to see what happens in relation to that—have seen an increase in the amount people have to pay to see a doctor. The changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme have seen people having to pay more for pharmaceuticals. The approval by the government to Telstra has seen the cost of line rentals on telephones skyrocket, and there is more. There is the cost for people of sending their kids to university, if they are lucky enough to find a place, the increased costs of child care—if, again, they are lucky enough to find a place—the cost of petrol, the cost of utilities that have now mostly been privatised and the cost of basic goods like food.</para><para>People are experiencing significant financial insecurity. The government has been moving strongly down the path of user pays—regardless of income—at the same time as increasing taxes. It is not just one small sector of the community; many sectors are finding it hard. Older people on fixed incomes, particularly those that do not own their own their homes, single people on low incomes struggling to pay debts and get ahead and families who, on top of all the issues mentioned previously, are trying to find the money to pay for their family tax benefit or child-care rebate debt are all finding it difficult under this government.</para><para>The great shame is that the Howard government is squandering the economic growth of the last 20 years and has eroded the foundations on which it was built. One of the issues we are going to hear a lot more about from industry and also from local councils, which are desperately concerned about what is happening to their future economic growth, is the skills crisis. There is a skills crisis in this country and it has happened during this government's watch. We live in a skilled and global economy. The Australian economy cannot grow and prosper as it has over the past 20 years without a skilled and dynamic work force. It is therefore alarming that, despite the Howard government's rhetoric on its good economic management, they are failing to provide Australia with its next generation of builders, carpenters, engineers, town planners, teachers and nurses. </para><para>Regional businesses, economies and families are feeling the effect of Australia's skills shortage right now. Regional Victoria has an even higher number of professions and industries experiencing a skills shortage than metropolitan areas. Regional economies have overcome many difficulties to survive and succeed in modern Australia. They have had to be more resourceful, dynamic and flexible to compete with many of the metropolitan businesses. Regional economies are often the first to feel the brunt of any economic reforms undertaken by governments.</para><para>One company in my district is having to bring in skilled boilermakers from China, as the local economy does not have the skills base to fill vacancies. DIMIA will be visiting my electorate shortly to meet with local businesses, to talk to them about how they could use temporary skilled work visas. This is at the same time as we have record levels of teenage unemployment in my community. There is something seriously wrong with a government that, during its nine-year watch, has allowed teenage unemployment rates to rise to the extent that they have and a skills shortage to exist. There is something seriously wrong with a government that has allowed an economy to emerge in regional and metropolitan Australia where that can happen.</para><para>Last month's skills vacancy index released by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations buttresses the experiences in my electorate. We are experiencing a skills crisis in key sectors of our economy. In the 12 months ending January 2005, skilled vacancies in the professions are up 5.3 per cent, while in the vital information and communications technology sector vacancies are up 63.7 per cent over the same period.</para><para>Over the past 12 months, the professions worst affected by the Howard government's skills crisis include those in building and engineering and health, which is up 3.8 per cent; accountants and auditors; organisation and information technicians; and science professions. These are the very sectors of our economy that will drive economic growth in Australia and assure that we remain a competitive force in the global market. These are the very sectors where the jobs for the next generation of Australians will be and these are the jobs that will allow tomorrow's Australians to enjoy the lifestyle that many of us enjoy today.</para><para>The Howard government has been asleep and policy lazy on this key economic issue. The problem has not even begun to be fixed, when we see that teenage unemployment is at record levels and thousands of people are being turned away from TAFE and universities. The gap between teenage unemployment rates in regional Victoria and inner city Melbourne is widening for four out of five regional districts which are suffering from increases in unemployment. Opportunities for younger Australians are not being created, despite the well-known skills shortage in regional Victoria.</para><para>My own electorate of Ballarat is the worst affected region. The Barwon West district, which covers Geelong, Ballarat and right up to the South Australian border and also covers Warrnambool, recorded a teenage unemployment rate of 34 per cent, compared to just 4.8 per cent in inner city Melbourne. Such a divide is totally unacceptable and is not affordable if Australia wants to maintain its competitiveness in a global economy. It is not just the level of teenage unemployment that is concerning but the speed at which it is occurring. In the Barwon West district we have seen a 10 per cent increase in the space of only a few months. Regional labour markets are suffering a skills shortage, yet we have large numbers of teenagers turned away from TAFE each year. The government's proposal to fix this is totally inadequate for the size of the problem. </para><para>Australian technical colleges in 24 regions across this country are not going to fix this problem. In my own electorate, I would have to say that the idea of a technical college is too little, too late. The government has the opportunity to do something about this immediately and that is to put more money into the TAFE system, straight away. Most communities, in order to get these Australian technical colleges, need to go through the expression of interest process and also have to wait at least two years before they come on line.</para><para>Most communities that have been offered these Australian technical colleges are really grappling with what the government means by them. I know, having seen the Warrnambool proposal, that they have very clearly said, `We've already got the infrastructure in place for this thing. What we are going to do is set up a virtual college.' I do not know if that is quite what the government had in mind when it announced these Australian technical colleges but we will wait and see. I suspect they are pretty keen to open a building with `Warrnambool technical college' on the front.</para><para>But even more bizarre is the total lack of transparency about where these are located and on what basis they have been located. Bendigo and Geelong in Victoria are being targeted for an Australian technical college. Ballarat is not. Where is the transparency in terms of why you are putting these things in Bendigo and Geelong and not necessarily putting something like that in Ballarat or addressing the skills shortage there?</para><para>I know the Mayor of the City of Ballarat will be visiting Canberra tomorrow. He has been trying for some time to see Minister Hardgrave about this issue and about the skills shortage issue in particular. Ballarat has a different model—it is not the Australian technical colleges model, because they do not think that is going to work and it certainly will not work in my electorate—that they would like to put to the minister. They cannot even get an appointment. That is how much the minister is interested in assisting regional economies and trying to help with both the skills shortage and teenage unemployment.</para><para>In the remaining time I have in this debate I want to turn to some of the local projects that have a major impact on our local economy. I have talked before in this place on the AusLink bill about the Deer Park bypass. It is absolutely extraordinary that, in the context where you have a road that has the highest cost-benefit ratio of any road project not just in Victoria but in the country, so little progress has been made. A feasibility study has been done for the route of the road. It is sitting on a national highway, the second busiest freight route in the whole of this country—the Hume being the first. It is the major transport link between Melbourne and Adelaide. It takes all of those car components from western Victoria to Adelaide to the car industry there. It takes all the wine grapes and all of the other market and engineering components that are manufactured in Ballarat, to Melbourne and on to Adelaide. It is a major economic development issue in our district.</para><para>What we saw from the government during the election campaign was absolutely cynical politics. Ballarat was not a targeted seat during the last election. I hope that that is not the case at the next election. In terms of what the government promised and what it actually did in my seat, it did nothing. There were lots of promises during the election campaign and lots of hope. `We're going to fund the Deer Park bypass; it's a major economic issue; we know it's a priority.' The Treasurer was out there in 2001 saying it was the most important project in the whole of Victoria—and what happened? We saw the Treasurer go down to Geelong to a project that was not even on the radar screen two years ago. Its cost-benefit ratio is nowhere near that of the project in my electorate. He went down to Geelong and announced full funding for that project—and it is a Commonwealthstate shared project. </para><para>For the project in my electorate, one that sits on the national highway, we get $40 million for a $294 million project. It is not to start this year or next year but after the next federal election. The bill is going to pass the Senate. It will be 100 per cent responsibility for the Commonwealth. It was cynical politics and our community reacted extremely strongly to the inadequate promises made during that campaign.</para><para>What is talked about in relation to tolls is absolute hypocrisy. What is going to happen in terms of national highways and the Deer Park bypass in particular? My community is now faced with the prospect that, if it ever wants to get this project built—we have $40 million already promised in 200708 to start this project and cannot start until we know we have the money to finish it—it will have to go to the state government and to the private sector. We now have to ask our local councils to work together to find the huge shortfall that the Commonwealth has left, the huge responsibility it has dumped on us in relation to a national highway that used to be a 100 per cent responsibility of the Commonwealth. That means potentially that all of the communities along that national highway and every other national highway in this country will have to fund their projects via private partnerships, which will mean tolls. So it is total hypocrisy on the part of the government to be making statements about tolls. Communities, such as mine, along a national highway are now faced with the reality that the only way they can get their road maintained and funded is via tolls—and the government should be condemned for it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>238</page.no><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phillip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARRESI</name><name.id>ZJ6</name.id><electorate>Deakin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very proud not only to be the member for Deakin for the fourth time, but once again to be a member of the Howard government.

This is the government's fourth term, and I am elated to be given the opportunity to once again represent my electorate. The people of Deakin are an intelligent, thought-provoking group with a high level of interest in matters of local, state and federal public policy. Let me say that with their thought-provoking intelligence the people of Deakin put me to the test on a regular basis, and I am proud to say that. I am here to represent them again and to do the best I can for those who voted for me and for those who wanted to see me out, but of course that is the nature of our democracy.</para></talk.start><para>As I made my way around the electorate to meet members of the community and discuss the issues that matter to them, it was clear that above all people seek the ability to engage at many different levels. People want the opportunity to engage with their families and their community in a meaningful and practical way. But they also want security, security of income and jobs, so they can raise their children without the fear so prevalent elsewhere in the globe. They recognised that the Howard government could deliver on those expectations and aspirations.</para><para>As expected with a slender margin and occupying a strategic outer suburban location, Deakin was a target for extensive campaigns from numerous interest groups and left-wing lobby groups. I must say the tactics directed towards the government and towards me personally were at times excessive. While I welcome hard-fought campaigns, I was sickened to hear that a prominent Melbourne newspaper opinion writer had the gall to propose placing caged children outside my electorate office in order to peddle her agenda against detention centres and to gain guaranteed publicity. </para><para>Sadly, some of these wacky ideas were not confined to interest groups. The alternative government, the ALP, also came up with its own list—be it a job-destroying forest policy to appease the Greens or its Medicare Gold health care for the over 70s that would have surely bankrupted the health budget. The ALP's repetitive and simplistic attack on the health system was flawed, with little factual integrity. Indeed, the electorate did not think that Medicare was in need of saving and did not buy the propaganda that was put out by the Labor Party during the campaign.</para><para>There are of course pressing issues in health care and the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon. Tony Abbott, I believe, has been a breath of fresh air and a magnificent minister for health in the time that he has been in the job. He has been to the electorate to listen to the needs of general practitioners for after-hours clinics and to the need for a Medicare funded MRI facility. My electorate has been identified as an area that needs a Medicare funded MRI facility within its local public hospital. I am pleased that the local peak health organisation, Eastern Health, with my strong urging and support, has formally applied to have the service based at one of its local hospitals. I am confident, with the looming announcement of the successful tender, that the eastern suburbs will be a beneficiary of such an announcement, but we will have to wait and see.</para><para>The Australian public resoundingly rejected the social engineering principles expressed by the left-wing intelligentsia behind the ALP. I am pleased to see that some of those left-wing elements have been pushed aside in the most recent reshuffle—although of course we do not know how many more reshuffles there will be between now and the end of the year. I for one know that by and large my constituents are concerned about the issues that matter most to their lives—namely, keeping the household budget in check, having a real choice about where to send their kids to school, having a real choice of where and how to obtain medical services, knowing that they can afford their mortgage and knowing that there are job opportunities for them and their families. These are the things that concern them. These are the things that we addressed. These are the things that we have directed our policy attention to over the last nine years, and we will continue to do so in the next term.</para><para>In the lead-up to the election it was fascinating to view local small business men and women interact with the Prime Minister when he visited Deakin on various occasions. They raised myriad issues from import duties to taxation concessions, to GST and to industry partnerships. All of these issues attracted active and healthy debate. However, they were all dwarfed by the most unanimous support for reform of the unfair dismissal laws. The government's failed attempts to reform unfair dismissal laws for small business has been a thorn in the side of the government. Small business owners and operators were vocal in their opposition to Australia's draconian one size fits all approach to unfair dismissal. This is an area that must be addressed by the current parliament, and I am encouraged by the announcement by Minister Andrews of further reforms in the workplace relations area which will aim to do just that and more.</para><para>At present in Australia we are experiencing low unemployment rates—the lowest unemployment rate in a generation. However, successful economic indicators should not prompt a government to rest on its laurels. I was also encouraged by the Prime Minister's comments only this week regarding the establishment of national awards and changes to federal-state industrial relations. The current system of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission also needs to be addressed. </para><para>One thing that I will be pushing forward, and certainly making appeals for in this term, is for us to look at the entire Industrial Relations Commission set-up. It was established over 100 years ago when federal-state relationships were very prominent and it was feared that the place of the states would be under threat by a federal government. We are now entering our second century. The Industrial Relations Commission is over 100 years old. We should be looking to see whether or not the current Industrial Relations Commission meets the needs of a modern, vibrant Australia that needs continuing productivity and industrial relations reforms. As a start, one thing we could do is look at the British Low Pay Commission rather than the current system, which allows the Industrial Relations Commission to be the arbiter of salary and wage decisions.</para><para>Today we were fortunate to see the Victorian government finally apply the National Code of Practice for the Construction Industry and the Australian Government Implementation Guidelines. This is an important step forward and a positive way of tackling reform in the $46 billion construction industry. It is an industry that has too long been blighted by corruption and thuggish tactics.</para><para>Another issue that popped up regularly throughout the election, and which has continued due to the emphasis given to it by the minister since we have returned, is that of vocational education. Vocational education is an issue of huge importance, not only in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne but throughout Australia, in particular the growing skill shortages in traditional trades. We have seen communities, parents and industry warm to the government's pronouncements on addressing vocational education needs.</para><para>Over the last 8½ years there has been a 181 per cent increase in the number of new apprenticeships in Deakin. There are 1,900 more places available than there were in the dying days of the former Keating government. Growth in this sector does not occur by accident or by fortuitous circumstance. The government has worked hard and has invested heavily in new apprenticeships. In the 2003-04 year alone, over $7½ million worth of incentives were allocated to Deakin to assist businesses in taking on apprentices.</para><para>During the last term, the Prime Minister visited the Starr automotive workshop in Blackburn to launch the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry new apprenticeships centre. This centre was a magnificent achievement. However, it is glowingly evident how continually hard it is to entice school-age people into a trade. There are many factors behind this; the most significant is what I would term the `Macklineske' ideal of `higher education or else'. That has created a cultural bias against entering a blue-collar profession. A key heartland to tackle this cultural bias is within the secondary school system and in the living rooms of most suburban homes.</para><para>To help facilitate this, I believe Minister Nelson has come up with a number of great ideas. One which is very specific to my electorate is when he came to launch the Automotive and Manufacturing Skills Centre at the Ringwood Secondary College. I have spoken about this before. I am proud of this achievement. The new centre operates in partnership with the Eastern Industry Education Partnership and targets its auto skills training to the transitional years between early adolescence and the end of secondary school. I am proud of this achievement because it was a federal government response to a need which the state government, the Bracks Labor government, specifically turned its back on—because they actually were approached on it. They were approached to submit the project through ANTA, and they turned their back on it. I am pleased that the federal government, and in particular Minister Nelson, came through and saw the centre up and running. This centre is available to schools across the eastern region of Melbourne and does not discriminate between government and non-government school students. </para><para>One of the things that I was astounded by during the last election campaign is that in the case of the most marginal coalition seat in Victoria—one which you would have thought the alternative government would have to win—Mr Latham failed to actually step into it. The opposition leader failed to enter into the electorate of Deakin. And no wonder. They did not have a good news story to tell. When you have people like Mr Latham and his education spokesman Jenny Macklin proudly announcing that they are going to cut funding to non-government schools, those sorts of wacky ideas did not resonate in the electorate. Although Labor did not propose to cut the funding to any of the major non-government schools in Deakin, several were going to have their funds frozen. It was a timely warning to parents and teachers that the ALP does not believe in a balanced educational system and real choice for families.</para><para>The second initiative from the Minister for Education, Science and Training which has received a lot of attention is the Australian technical colleges, which will provide a natural progression in the area of vocational training. Engaging the local training and industry communities in vocational education is paramount in ensuring the cultural bias against the blue-collar trades is tackled. The solution does not lie with governments telling our young school leavers that there is a shift in emphasis to trades. It lies in providing students and industry with a meaningful role in the future of training.</para><para>Since that announcement we have had Minister Hardgrave release a discussion paper in Deakin last month and I have met with local peak training bodies to discuss a possible eastern suburbs consortia for a local college. Those discussions continued as early as eight o'clock this morning when there was a meeting called by the Ringwood Secondary College with the local TAFE colleges, other schools and industry as well. They met on the premises of AAA, the Australian automotive vehicle premises, to discuss establishing a consortia. While the eastern region of Melbourne has been identified as a key area of need, the necessity for a strong proposal in or near Deakin is high. I am not going to stand up and say it has to be within my electorate. I recognise that as long as it is in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne it is going to be of great benefit to young people.</para><para>One of the first pieces of legislation to pass this new parliament was a $33 billion package, the largest ever investment in education by a government in Australia. It represents an increase of $9.5 billion over the current fouryear agreement. The significance of this package is the direct funding of schools and students for the areas of capital works and tuition. It is a notion that really appeals to the local community. Schools in the area are excited by this prospect. No longer do they have to wait for some state bureaucrat to decide whether or not the torn carpet, leaking roof or run-down toilet facilities warrant upgrade and maintenance. No longer do they need to push for another lamington drive in order to pay for this nor does the principal need to continue to pray for mercy from the Bracks state minister for education to receive attention. That is the kind of dilemma that some of these schools have been facing. I am pleased to see that this package has been welcomed in the electorate and I certainly will be pushing to see that the schools in the area that do need upgrades and capital works put their hands up and receive funding for much needed projects. </para><para>In the time that I have left I want to touch on an issue which has been dear to the hearts of most MPs of the eastern suburbs and which members on the other side are probably sick and tired of hearing us talk about—that is, the Scoresby Freeway. One cannot ignore the message that voters sent to the Labor Party about their deceitful backflip on tolls on the Scoresby Freeway. This was clearly the most emotive issue throughout the Deakin election campaign and it demonstrated that the ALP, at both the state and the federal level, simply cannot be trusted to represent the interests of our area. I was amazed to consistently hear the ALP simply dismiss the backflip as a state issue. I imagine this is also one of the reasons why Mark Latham, the then Leader of the Opposition, failed to come to the electorate of Deakin for the entire election campaign. He knew that if he crossed Middleborough Road, if he came down the Eastern Freeway and down Springvale Road, he would have been ambushed by a very irate community that felt they had been deceived by the state, and deceived by his announcement very early on in the election campaign. He did not even have the guts to make the announcement of the federal ALP's backflip in the electorate. He made the announcement in a radio studio. One of the opposition leader's first campaign announcements was to remove that $445 million. Quite simply, the ALP and their supporters that they bussed in for the campaign did not understand the issues that matter to this part of the world that I represent.</para><para>It is interesting to read today that the Victorian Minister for Transport, Peter Batchelor, is accusing the federal government of blackmailing the Bracks government through bilateral AusLink funding. Central to his argument is the need to honour the contract signed with the successful tollway consortium, ConnectEast. This is certainly a tall order from the only state transport minister in Australia to break a written, signed agreement between a state and the Commonwealth.</para><para>I observe with interest that the <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> recently passed through the lower house. As I have already highlighted in this speech, the issues of roads and transport are key in Deakin. While the Bracks Labor government has backflipped on Scoresby, there are other prominent road issues in the eastern suburbs. In my electorate we have one of the worst traffic black spots in the entire state of Victoria—that is, the intersection of Springvale and Whitehorse roads in Nunawading, where there is a level crossing only 100 metres away. The need for action on this intersection is pressing. Not only is it the junction of two of the state's busiest roads, Springvale and Whitehorse roads, but also it has a level crossing and is going to be a feeder road for getting off and on the Eastern Freeway-Scoresby Freeway interchange.</para><para>There has already been a lot of money poured into that intersection by the federal and state governments, but there is an urgent need to address the problem in a more sustainable way. It is one of Melbourne's major north-south thoroughfares, which is used by approximately 125,000 vehicles per day. The level crossing services the two main eastern railway lines and accounts for 250 passenger trains a day. Springvale Road and the railway line clearly need to be separated. To their credit, the local Whitehorse City Council has recognised the importance of this and has conducted a feasibility study of grade separation of the site. </para><para>In light of the clear problem in the study undertaken by the council, the federal government has taken a lead role in addressing this issue by committing to sit down with the council, VicRoads and the state government to pursue how this intersection can be fixed. The council study came up with seven recommendations, ranging from additional traffic lanes to a large-scale undergrounding of Springvale Road. I welcome the upcoming meeting—which will take place in the next two weeks—between the council, officers from the Department of Transport and Regional Services and me to discuss the options for the site. I call on the Bracks government to get behind the project with funding of its own. It is absurd for the state Labor government and the state representative for Mitcham to consider any other local crossing ahead of Springvale Road.</para><para>There are a number of other projects in the Deakin electorate which I could talk about and no doubt there will be opportunities in the House to do so, but I want to end by paying tribute to the hundreds of community groups in Deakin for their tireless work in assisting the welfare of others. Whether their work be in local youth welfare, with the elderly, in the environment or in other valuable areas, these people do good work for our local community and make our life so much better. The recent Australia Day celebrations afforded me the privilege of honouring many of these local heroes with the Deakin Community Australia Day awards. I am pleased to have made those awards. I am pleased to once again be a member of the government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>243</page.no><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name><name.id>BV5</name.id><electorate>Lyons</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When I came into the House the member for Deakin was into one of his attacks on conciliation and arbitration in this country without any real understanding of the significant history or constitutional requirements. I do not think the member for Deakin likes working people very much. Most of us, like a lot of people, get pretty sick of that side of the House constantly attacking one side of the argument in industrial relations. The government is not going about this debate with fairness. It is a one-sided debate. I think the honourable member for Deakin has got a considerable amount to learn to have any understanding of fairness in the workplace.</para></talk.start><para>In my speech in the address-in-reply debate tonight, I must first thank the people of Lyons who gave me the opportunity to continue my work for them. I give my commitment that I will continue to put their interests first in my deliberations in this parliament, in the House of Representatives. We live in tremendously turbulent times with the world changing after the tsunami. Even if people have not had family involved in that, the feeling of anxiety and grief that has rocked the world has certainly touched all our lives. We have had our Labor leader fall sick in the middle of all this and, because so much else was happening, the fact did not sink into our consciousness until it became a major problem. Mark Latham felt he could not continue because of health issues and stood down.</para><para>I was very critical of Mark during the election campaign because of the way he rewrote the forestry policy without consultation and without reference to anyone in the industry. It cost us two seats in Tasmania and we lost the trust of many people in rural Tasmania. But many other parts of the policy had been carefully developed and could have been a healthy new direction, so I was disappointed that we did not have the option to work together again to change and improve our policies. I am sad for Mark that he had to stand down in the circumstances in which he did but I understand that his health and family must come first. I hope he finds his place in a different environment where he can still continue to contribute. </para><para>Now we again have Kim as our leader. It is a new start for the Labor Party to rebuild people's trust and confidence. At this stage Kim is giving us a great feeling of stability and strength while we really start to sort ourselves out. It is another challenge that we face in the year of the rooster, the year of new horizons, and I know my colleagues and I will be working hard to ensure there are lots of good ideas going out to our communities, to give them a chance to choose a better alternative to the current government. So during this year I will be talking to my communities around Lyons and asking them to continue their good work in advising me of what is wrong with this government's policy and how it is affecting them on the ground. This I will bring to the parliament. It will involve asking a few questions with their help, attempting to find answers to those important questions that will enhance this country, our work force, our seniors, our veterans and of course our young people.</para><para>During the election a number of very expensive promises were made by the government in its bid to retain office. I would now like to remind my colleagues opposite that, having made those promises, they are duty bound to keep them. Let us start with forestry. The federal government has now committed itself to a sum of $51 million in Tasmania over four years towards preserving some old-growth forest. There has been a lot of discussion about this, but still we have no idea where the money will be spent and how it will be distributed. So that is one thing I will be following with great interest. I do not believe we should lock up anything more. But there are areas that would benefit by having more funds spent on them to ensure their values are properly preserved.</para><para>The Bass Highway was promised $15 million to fund the upgrade at Sisters Hills. I would like to point out that my erstwhile colleague Sid Sidebottom got a commitment out of the opposition in 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2004 for funds to be committed to this project—and they were, without any strings attached. Now we have a situation where the federal government has copycatted and begrudgingly committed the $15 million but on the condition that the state government put in a contribution. This road is and should be part of the federal roads system and thus it should be funded under the federal roads budget without recourse to the state, which has the responsibility of course for all the other roads. What we have here is some petty politicking that is just going to delay the inevitable. In the meantime, the northwest coast people have to cross their arms, sit on the side and watch this silly endplay. On this, I say, `Get on with the job; no more procrastination; let's sort this road out now,' so I will be watching this with great interest.</para><para>While we are on the northwest there are a couple of little projects that have been raised by my friend Sid, who was always pestering the bean counters in the party for funds. The projects were the rhododendron gardens and, of course, the Axeman's Hall of Fame. The latter used to be in my electorate until the boundaries changed. I also fought for that to be funded and I am looking forward to seeing this important Tasmanian feature finalised. These are the sorts of projects that should be given high priority as they add to Tasmania's interest and prosperity.</para><para>I have been keeping my eye on the Bass electorate too. Our new member for Bass should be so busy handing out cheques that he will not even have time to attend parliament. If we are to believe all the money that was promised there, millions of dollars will flow into Bass. Talk about buying a seat. The budget purse had a hole in the bottom when it came to Bass. One of the promises was for a technical trades college. It appears there is to be an alternative TAFE that is propped up by industry. It seems a pity that there are no funds for existing training establishments but, according to a press release from the Minister for Education, Science and Training, he wants them to be run and managed a bit like non-government schools in that we do not want a centralised education bureaucracy to run them. This assumes that someone else will be picking up the tab for the administration, a favourite trick of this government: fund projects but let some other poor group pick up the expensive bit—administration, wages, safety issues, insurance et cetera—and just take the glory for the project. </para><para>This is typical of this government and can be seen in the Work for the Dole schemes and many other so-called community and privatised schemes. I am disgusted that this can be called fair and equitable when the many hopeful groups get slogged for those costs and therefore either go out of existence or have to find some other way of delivering the training side. The government would be better off funding the existing organisations and not worrying about the political correctness of privatisation. It does not do anyone or anything any good except the political rhetoric. Funding is needed in the VET area urgently and I can only hope that some of our enterprising teachers can use this program.</para><para>Then we have the $600,000 promise to establish regional business and development support—which is fine. This seems to be bankrolling two new positions and perhaps even developing a new export hub—which is not a bad idea. This might possibly help put some more funding into our freight needs out of the state, something that has been lacking for some time. The state has done the lion's share of this, so it is about time that the federal government put in and had a go at it.</para><para>Then there was some money for the setting up of the pulp mill—a mere $5 million—even though it may not be needed for the mill itself but rather for the infrastructure around it. I am not quite sure what is factored into this promise. Then, of course, there is the $3 million for the river bank improvements in Launceston, $1 million each for the swimming pools in Burnie and Devonport and $4 million for the Elphin Sport Centre, all adding up to a tidy sum in Bass and Braddon. These funds will be keenly awaited, and I will be waiting with great interest to hear their announcement throughout this year.</para><para>What about the $3 million promised for roads between Bridport and Scottsdale, Nunamara and Targa—just a snip to keep the road lobby at bay. These roads need money, so let's get on with it and get them sorted out. The Minister for Defence announced that the future of the Scottsdale Defence Research Centre was secure. I do not think it was under threat from us, so it must have been from the other side. But I am glad that these jobs are secure and I will keep an eye out to make sure that they do not disappear when the chooks start coming home to roost.</para><para>Now let us have a look at what was promised in my own electorate of Lyons. I am afraid the Liberal candidate has disappeared into thin air—it is a bit like where he came from—but they made these promises. Now I am chasing them up to provide this money and I am going to follow it right down until it is spent in my electorate. Firstly, there was the recycled $7 million for cleaning up the King River on the west coast. The old mine was dumping tailings straight into the river. This one has been around for a while and I was looking forward to work starting on the King, because there are many businesses in Strahan that would benefit from this clean-up. They said it would go ahead immediately. I have not seen anything yet, and I was only over there on Australia Day for celebrations at the miners' picnic. I rode the Apt Railway over—the first miners' train for 42 years to go to the picnic. It was good to relive that old tradition. I guess the government must have gone on holiday, because they have not started that work on the King River yet, but it was promised to start immediately. </para><para>We were also promised $100,000 for the Lyell districts war memorial hall, which would be an added bonus for Queenstown if it comes off. I look forward to that coming in. They also promised $15,000 for a skate park in Queenstown. The kids will be pleased to see that. I have been meeting with them on and off over the last couple of years to help them choose an area and start a bit of fundraising so that they have something to contribute and are a part of it, as I have done in many communities around the Lyons electorate. So the kids will be waiting and looking forward to that. I talked to a few the other day—they are looking forward to getting their skate park. I do not think they will see the Liberal candidate again, but I am sure that one of the other government members or the minister will turn up with the skate park funding.</para><para>Then there was $1.7 million for the Trail of the Tin Dragon, going from Bass, running into Lyons and picking up the old tin trail where a lot of the Chinese who came to Tasmania in the 1800s mined for tin. And a great joss house which sits in the museum in Launceston could be returned to the north-east in some sort of display—it would certainly build into our tourist attractions in that part of the state, where the state government is putting in a lot of effort and a lot of infrastructure. I look forward to seeing this happen and I look forward to the $15,000 which has been promised for the feasibility study. The sting in the tail, of course, is that, if the study does not recommend that it go ahead, the $1.7 million will not be forthcoming. So there are some weasel words in that to be sorted out, but I will certainly be raising that again.</para><para>What else was there? I remember a little article in the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> newspaper on 5 October entitled `Funds to rain on Hagley School'. A bit like rain, this is all that happened. This little pocket of gold was to shore up Senator Barnett's old school at Hagley to do up the accommodation for visiting schoolchildren and to build an interpretation centre to promote the deeper understanding of sustainable agriculture. That is good stuff and I support it. It is interesting how these little things work. I am not deriding the school; it is a very good school, providing a great service to the community. There are many that could do with these sorts of funds to help them develop additional resources. I hope Senator Barnett does not stop at this one. I will be watching and reminding him of his commitment.</para><para>I note there was an interesting selection of projects in the south. New Norfolk features quite heavily in the promises too. We can add those local figures to the list of national promises of which Tasmania is a beneficiary. I would say there are a lot of projects coming to Tasmania as a result of the Liberals' election commitments. But we will not see any additional help for our hospitals. We are not putting funds into getting more doctors and specialists trained in our universities. We are having universities put up their fees again to get the courses on, and working people are still trying to work out whether they can afford private health insurance or to register their car. Much of this money, although welcome in itself, is not dealing with the huge number of problems faced by Tasmanians every day. What about the one call zone for Telstra? What about decent reception statewide for the ABC and SBS? What about access to the mobile phone system and broadband technology? The only thing we are hearing about at the moment, of course, is that Telstra is to be sold. </para><para>It is time to do the sums and actually start doing what a federal government is supposed to be doing, such as getting on with delivering a national bushfire strategy. We just had the COAG report dropped by the Prime Minister. A heck of a lot of issues came out of the bushfire inquiry, of which I was the deputy chair, after the disaster in Canberra. We still have not got a national strategy in place, and we are just about through the end of this year's bushfire season—a great neglect by this federal government. We have got to sort out our departmental information systems so that people with mental health problems will not get lost in the system, and we have got to deal with the health and education problems that exist in this country.</para><para>My commitment for this term is to watch the promises made and make sure that they are kept, to continue my rounds of the Lyons electorate to ensure that everybody who has a problem can get access to me in my office, to let people know what is available through the federal government assistance programs for their communities and to make sure that the government meets its commitments made at the last election.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>247</page.no><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name><name.id>HK6</name.id><electorate>Herbert</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We had an election late last year and I was privileged to be returned for the fourth time as the member for Herbert. I very much appreciate the vote of confidence that I received from members of my electorate. During the election campaign, I certainly was able to promise a number of very important programs for the seat of Herbert, and I am going to deliver—not like the former speaker. I do not know what his position is, but I am certainly going to deliver.</para></talk.start><para>Let me run through the major commitments that I made. We are going to have an Australian technical college in Townsville, and I would like to report to the parliament tonight that I think we are going to have the first in Australia. I have had tremendous support from the local authority, the City of Thuringowa, who have taken the lead role in making sure that all the community comes together and puts in a bid that is going to succeed. We are certainly very hopeful of being able to start in the beginning of 2006, in 12 months time. There are some processes to go through between now and then, but I have great confidence in the groups that are involved in the consortium that is being put together.</para><para>I thank Mayor Les Tyrell for his and his council's commitment to making the Australian technical college happen. It is very important. With the skills shortages in the north, particularly in the mining and construction industries, we desperately need more people trained. I thank the principals of the local high schools who have also very enthusiastically embraced the concept of an Australian technical college because they want to see a pathway that is school to work through skills training. I think we are going to get a great outcome.</para><para>Another commitment that I am going to deliver on is the tropical science research precinct at James Cook University. You can say that pretty quickly, but what does it mean? It means that within 10 years James Cook University will be one of the top five tropical universities in the world. That is where we are going as a result of the commitment that I have made to the electorate, and I am very proud of that. Part of the tropical science research precinct will be what are now the reef and rainforest CRCs. They are likely to take on a new name when their current funding runs out, but they will continue. The precinct will include the CSIRO, the Australian Institute of Marine Science and of course James Cook University.</para><para>On top of that, just to show that I have been working very hard, we are going to have the first new veterinary science undergraduate degree in any Australian university in years. But like the television commercial, there is more: there will also be a tropical agricultural science degree. That will all link in with the medical precinct at James Cook University, particularly vet science. You understand, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, the shortage of vets in regional Australia and the threat of diseases that are coming in down the cape. We need to be on guard for Australia. Biosecurity issues are very significant, and we need local vets trained to look after those sorts of issues. We are going a step further forward with this particular degree by looking at zoonosis—the transfer of diseases in animals to diseases in humans. That will link into the medical school. So the foresight and vision that are there will certainly set up James Cook University to be a very significant university in the years ahead. </para><para>With respect to another of our election commitments, I am proud to say that I have secured almost $6 million for the Great Green Way project. Townsville to Cairns is a tourism region in Australia that should not be missed. The philosophy of this program is not just to get tourists to Cairns, Townsville or somewhere in between but to get tourists to experience the region. Cairns has some significant attributes that Townsville would like to be part of, and of course Townsville has significant attributes that Cairns would like to be part of. Under the Great Green Way project, which is the linkage between Townsville and Cairns, we will be able to share our tourists and that is very important for both ends of the region.</para><para>There are some very significant tourist attractions in North Queensland, and of course the major tourist attraction is the weather. Townsville has 300 days of sunshine every year, but there is a negative: it does not rain, so Townsville can be brown from time to time. But that is fine. The dry tropics are an experience.</para><para>Cairns is the reverse, with the rainforest and the wet tropics. We have the World Heritage area in the rainforest and the World Heritage area in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Those two World Heritage areas meet and you can stand in two World Heritage areas at the same time. We have got it in North Queensland! We have some very significant other attractions such as the Undara lava tubes, the longest lava tubes in the world, sitting north-west of Townsville, south-west of Cairns. They are an awe-inspiring experience. This $6 million program will be money wisely spent by the tourism and development bodies in the north and will bring great benefits to the region.</para><para>But there is more. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you will also understand this: I have secured a commitment from the Department of Defence to continue on immediately with the stage 4 upgrade of Lavarack Barracks. You have been to Lavarack Barracks on many occasions. You know that the barracks, which were built in the 1960s, need to be refurbished. We are currently doing stage 3. Stage 4 will be another $175 million pumped into the Townsville economy in the refurbishment of, principally, 4 Field Regiment and also 3 Combat Engineer Regiment, Lavarack Barracks. To have that kind of money circulating in the economy will mean pretty full employment and prosperity for the people of Australia's largest tropical city.</para><para>There is more. I had a look at what was needed for road projects in the region and how, by spending Commonwealth money, we could best improve traffic flow through the region. To the surprise and delight of many, I secured $40 million for the completion of the Townsville ring-road. When the existing Douglas arterial road is finished and opened at the end of March—in about seven weeks—that will make a mighty change to the traffic flows in the city and bring great convenience to the residents of the Upper Ross. This new Townsville ring-road project will connect the end of the Douglas arterial road through to the northern Bruce Highway and will open up the access roads from the north into the university, the hospital and Lavarack Barracks and the reverse. That is an absolutely great result. </para><para>I would like to pay a tribute to the men and women of Australia's Defence Force based in Townsville. In the break when the parliament was up, we had several deployments overseas. We saw Alpha Company of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment deploy in 18 hours, from being on Christmas holidays to being on the ground in the Solomons in response to the death of Adam Dunning in Honiara. I guess it shocked people who did not want to obey the law in Honiara when they saw 100 soldiers from the 1st Battalion arrive within 18 hours of that event.</para><para>Those people are the most professional people, the most dedicated people. I farewelled them. I saw the families. It was two days before Christmas, but the wives said to me, `Look, it's my husband's job. I understand. He goes with our best wishes. We'll have Christmas when he comes back,' and they did. I was privileged not only to farewell the 1st Battalion soldiers but also to welcome them home again. I was also privileged to welcome home soldiers who came back from Iraq, as I was to farewell 11 Brigade who went to the Solomons and 11 Brigade who went on another exercise that we do not talk about for security reasons. It was a magic experience to be there. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek to continue my comments when the debate is resumed.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Main Committee adjourned at 7.31 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></maincomm.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions in Writing</type><title>QUESTIONS IN WRITING</title><page.no>250</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra</title><page.no>250</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 21)</subtitle><id.no>21</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>250</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Murphy</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 17 November 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Has the Minister seen the article by Ian Royall titled “Telstra late fee faces legal fight” in the Herald-Sun on 25 November 2003 which reported that Telstra had announced that in March 2004 the penalty for the late payment of bills would rise from $5.50 to $11 for bills of $130 or more.</para><para>(2)	Has the Minister seen the article by Kirsty Needham titled “Push to lift electricity late fees” in The Sydney Morning Herald on 8 December 2003 which reported comments by the Chair of the Australian Consumers Association, Mr Chris Field, to the effect that the Telstra late-payment fee might be unlawful and that companies can only charge a fee that represents the actual cost to them of the consumer's default, rather than an amount that would be construed as a penalty.</para><para>(3)	Can the Minister confirm that Telstra has recently doubled its late-payment fee for bills exceeding $130;

In accordance with statutory requirements, the Government has commenced a review of matters relating to the end of the moratorium on the allocation of new commercial television broadcasting licences, which concludes on 31 December 2006. The question of whether any further commercial television licence should be issued after 2006 will be one for the government of the day.</para><para>(3)	A large and diverse range of content is offered by subscription television providers, including Foxtel. Foxtel promotes its digital subscription service as providing over 130 channels and services. It would be reasonable to assume that a broad range of niche markets and interests would be catered for with such a large number of channels and services.</para><para>(4)	(a) to (c) The Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association (ASTRA) reports that approximately 1.6 million homes are now subscribing to subscription television in Australia. This represents approximately 21.3% of households with television. An alternative way of calculating the share of the television market is as a percentage of population. ASTRA estimates, based on an estimated average of 3.4 residents in a typical subscription television home, that the penetration rate in Australia for subscription television is 26.1%.</para><para>Therefore, between 73% and 79% of television viewers rely on free-to-air television alone. Monthly subscription fees can be as low as $44.95 (the price listed for Austar's basic digital package).

The member for Hunter suggested that comments made by the Deputy Speaker constituted an intervention in debate on the motion of dissent.</para></talk.start><para>I have consulted the relevant <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and commissioned research into similar situations. <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice</inline> indicates, at page 565, that words critical of the character or conduct of a person—and this includes members of the House—whose actions can only be challenged by means of a substantive motion should not be included in the terms of a matter of public importance. The serious nature of such challenges is emphasised by the fact that a substantive motion allows the House to vote on such actions. A matter of public importance does not provide opportunity for the House to come to a decision by a vote.</para><para>The terms of the matter approved for discussion on 8 December did not specifically identify any persons. However, when matters of this kind are being discussed by the House, it is not in order to make comments that are critical, in a personal sense, of individuals during the course of the discussion. Matters such as that proposed for discussion on 8 December tend to provide challenges for self-discipline by members of the House. When this self-discipline is absent, it is incumbent upon the occupant of the chair to intervene. This has been the situation for some time, as indicated by the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 9 April 1974 in respect of Deputy Speaker Scholes, and of 28 November 1995 in respect of Deputy Speaker Jenkins.</para><para>On 8 November, on more than one occasion the Deputy Speaker requested the member addressing the House to desist from the terms he was using in speaking to the matter of public importance. The Deputy Speaker then ordered the member to resume his seat when he persisted. I believe that there were a number of options available to the Deputy Speaker in a situation that could have been construed as defiance of the chair, including naming and subsequent suspension of the member, and ordering the member to withdraw from the chamber for an hour. In withdrawing the member's call to talk on the matter, the Deputy Speaker could be seen to have applied a less harsh option.</para><para>In relation to the specific question put to me by the member for Hunter, I believe that, on a rigid application of the standing orders and <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice</inline>, the Deputy Speaker was not required to accept the motion of dissent stemming from his requirement for the member for Wills to resume his seat. Following the moving of the motion of dissent by the then Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Speaker, in making the statement which forms the substance of the member for Hunter's complaint, was simply placing before the House a summary of the statement on the practice of the House that he had made during the comments made by the member for Wills—namely, that it was not in order, in addressing a matter of public importance, to make personal reflections on and imputations against a member of the House in the absence of a substantive motion. The Deputy Speaker thus provided the House with a succinct statement of the proposition on which it was going to be asked to vote on the motion of dissent. This was an appropriate course of action, in my opinion. </para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>88</page.no></debateinfo><para>Mr ABBOTT (Warringah—Leader of the House) (3.32 p.m.)—Documents are presented as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members.

Let me say in response that essentially we were had and the Australian people were had. We were given the impression that there was an orderly, independent process of assessment of these applications and that these grants were being made pursuant to that due process. Subsequently, the truth has come out that applications were approved without an application even being lodged. Applications were approved without the support or recommendation of the local area consultative committee. Applications were approved for projects which were in competition with other, private sector projects—the doctrine of competitive neutrality was being flouted. Applications were approved in circumstances where there was such a flagrant conflict of interest that a representative of the applicants was working as a staffer in the minister's officer. So, all over the place, we have come across unsatisfactory, inappropriate, improper aspects of administration of this program, and we intend to criticise them. It would be irresponsible of us to do anything less than that.</para></talk.start><para>The other thing that the minister said by way of response to some of our concerns about Regional Partnerships was the claim that a similar number of applications from Labor electorates were successful compared to the number coming from Liberal and National Party electorates. Let me assure the House that the only reason there is any substance to that is that there is a very low number of applications coming forward from Labor electorates compared with those coming from Liberal and National Party electorates. The reason for that is that Regional Partnerships has essentially been operated as a secret society. I invite members on my side of the House to indicate to me just what advice they received from the government about the existence of this scheme. It was a scheme whereby the government appointed the chairs of the area consultative committees—they appointed their fellow committee members—and then set about assessing applications. Many of those applications have been essentially inside jobs. This is a program for those in the know. We have seen it degenerate into a $150 million pork barrel administered by the Leader of the National Party himself. </para><para>We are indebted to the Independent member for New England for first blowing the whistle in relation to this arrangement. He had the temerity to think that there might be some Regional Partnerships money for projects in his electorate—for example, the Tamworth Equine and Livestock Centre—and the message came back from the government: `No, we're not going to fund that project while the Independent member for New England is associated with it.' Their idea was that the purpose of this program was to benefit the National Party. So, if the Independent member for New England was associated with it, it certainly was not achieving its purpose at all. So they had to get rid of him. When we asked Minister Anderson about this, he said that the reason that they had demanded that the name of the Independent member for New England be removed from the application was that they did not want the program to be political.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition member interjecting—</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name></talker><para>—Yes, astonishing—a great sense of irony! When we started examining this program we found, as I have indicated to the House, applications being approved prior to applications being lodged, applications falling over and applications being approved despite the advice of the department. The Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee discovered in its hearings last week that principally Minister Kelly had departed from departmental recommendations not to approve a project and had decided to approve projects on 11 occasions. On a further three occasions she had given the projects 100 per cent of the funding sought, when the department had recommended less. On a further three occasions, where the department had recommended that a project be approved, she had not approved the project. The Auditor-General has made plain in his investigation of previous programs that he believes that where this happens there needs to be a paper trail, that the reasons for the departure from the departmental recommendation need to be given and that those reasons need to be made public.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is extraordinary that this government refuses to make public the reasons for those decisions and departures. Indeed, this government refuses to make public the recommendations from the area consultative committees. That makes a joke of the whole process of independent assessment. It makes a farce of the whole idea of public accountability—where the government goes before the Senate committee and says, `No, we are not prepared to tell you what the area consultative committee has recommended,' and, when it suits the government, it will say, `Oh, this project was recommended by the area consultative committee.' But it is not prepared to make available to the House and to the people of Australia the totality of recommendations coming forward from area consultative committees about these projects. </para><para>The other comment I would like to make about this idea that 78 per cent of projects have been approved is that it is almost an `everyone's a winner' situation. Some honourable members will remember the Centenary of Federation projects. All of us, as local members, had the capacity to go out and seek applications. I do not know what the general arrangement was, but in my electorate we ended up funding six or seven applications but knocking back 40 or 50, so it was not an `everyone's a winner' situation. There were many more applications than could be successful grants. But Regional Partnerships has been a program for those in the know and as a result there has been a relative scarcity of applications. It has not been advertised in the newspapers, on radio or on TV. Opposition members have not been informed of the nature of it; it has been kept in-house.</para><para>Since my speech in parliament before Christmas on this issue we have learned details of a further project where good money was thrown after bad. Some $660,000 of taxpayers' money was given to the Beaudesert Shire Railway Support Group through the Regional Partnerships program in a circumstance where Beaudesert Rail had gone into receivership back in May 2003. That did not stop this government committing a further $660,000 to get Beaudesert Rail out of receivership. But we know that this project is not happening, even though Beaudesert Rail came out of receivership late last year with creditors receiving just 19 cents in the dollar. I understand that this project ceased operating in August this year and is subject to continuing legal action by creditors. Taxpayers are entitled to much more prudent stewardship of their money than this.</para><para>Today we have seen a situation which just about takes the cake in terms of Regional Partnerships worst practice. Back in July and August 2004 the government announced two Regional Partnerships program grants totalling $1.5 million to facilitate dredging of Tumbi Creek, located at The Entrance in the marginal electorate of Dobell. Those grants, announced by the local member for Dobell and by the Prime Minister, were to fund the dredging of the mouth of Tumbi Creek and the relocation of spoil to the municipal tip. We matched the government's funding commitment during the 2004 election campaign. We were told this project had been approved under Regional Partnerships. We assumed that it had been properly assessed, so why wouldn't we support it? Like all other Australians, we have been misled in relation to this matter.</para><para>The member for Dobell announced the first Regional Partnerships grant of $748,000 on 8 June. That announcement preceded Wyong Shire Council's consideration of a dredging options report and a decision to lodge an application under the Regional Partnerships program. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> Central Coast extra edition on 9 June last year carried this report:</para><quote><para>Federal member for Dobell, Ken Ticehurst, yesterday committed the money to pay for 15,000 cubic metres of spoil to be dredged and dumped at Buttonderry Tip near Wyee under the Regional Partnerships program. Wyong Shire Council will meet tonight to decide how best to deal with the Tumbi Creek problem and whether or not to apply for the funding.</para></quote><para>What a bizarre process. How can the member for Dobell be saying that Minister Kelly has approved this project when Minister Kelly has not even seen an application? She has approved the grant; now all we need is the application. That reminds me of the Queen of Hearts in <inline font-style="italic">Alice in Wonderland</inline>, who sentenced first and the trial came later. In Minister Kelly's case, it is grant first and lodge the application later. According to advice from the Department of Transport and Regional Services to the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee regional funding inquiry, the first Tumbi Creek funding application was lodged on 24 June last year and approved on the same day—16 days after the member for Dobell announced the first Regional Partnerships funding allocation. This ought to be compared with other area consultative committees, who have been waiting months and months for a decision from this department. </para><para>We also discovered that there was a second application. The Department of Transport and Regional Services told the Senate inquiry that Regional Partnerships applications were lodged on 24 June and on 11 July. The Prime Minister announced the second Regional Partnerships funding allocation on 26 August, three days before the federal election date was named, and yet the Department of Transport and Regional Services says that just one approval was made, on 24 June—the same day the first application was received. Either no formal approval was granted with respect to the second funding application, or the full funding was approved prior to submission of the second application and the public campaign for state government funding was just a charade. It is important to understand that no part of this process fell within the election period and no action related to this process could be considered as an election commitment free from the rigour of standard administrative processes.</para><para>We have also discovered that the local area advisory consultative committee considers the project proposal a low priority and that the New South Wales government has expressed concern about the proposed expenditure of $2 million on remedial action unrelated to the Tuggerah Lakes estuary management plan. As I indicated to the House earlier, not only did we have that bizarre and farcical situation of grants being approved without applications even being made, let alone assessed, but we subsequently had a situation where rainfall last year washed out the Tumbi Creek mouth. We had a situation where Mr Graeme Hallett, a special adviser in the office of Jim Lloyd, Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, wrote to Giulio Cerasani, Mr Cobb's DLO, about the conditions for this grant, making clear his expectation that there would be no doubt about the way forward to deliver the commitment on Tumbi Creek. I understand that Mr Hallett had been working as one of the campaign team in the office of the member for Dobell, so he was in a position to know a great deal about the member for Dobell's views on these matters. He fired off an email to the department saying, `We don't want any doubt about the way forward to deliver the commitment on Tumbi Creek.' He said:</para><quote><para>The commitment by the Howard government to the electors of Dobell, in partnership with the Wyong council, is non-negotiable. It is the position of Mr Ticehurst that the money be delivered as agreed for the works in the schedule of agreement under Regional Partnerships.</para></quote><para>His message to the department was very clear. His expectation was that that money would be paid over, regardless of whether or not it was needed any longer for dredging works. When his email to the department did not seem to be hitting the mark, he fired off another email to the member for Dobell and the Wyong shire non-Labor councillors, issuing the following warning:</para><quote><para>Any changes mean less federal money, so Wyong officials should keep their counsel on this if we want the total allocated by the PM for Tumbi Creek.</para></quote><para>The import of that email is absolutely clear. The intention is to defraud taxpayers. The intention is to make sure that the grant goes ahead, whether it is needed or not. That is scandalous. We have the minister's office seeking to mislead his own department. We have the minister's office telling Wyong Shire Council, `You keep quiet about this; otherwise we will lose some of this money.' This is a disgraceful situation. It is time the Prime Minister faced up to his responsibilities under his ministerial code of conduct. It is time he faced up to his responsibility to make sure that Regional Partnerships becomes something better than a National Party slush fund. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>92</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I certainly welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance, especially when it is to make clear what an incredibly good program Regional Partnerships has been. While the input from the members opposite has been all about what it does for National Party people—they intimate that this is in regional and remote Australia—in actual fact today they have done nothing but talk about almost metropolitan projects. And that is what Regional Partnerships is about. It does not just look after regional Australia. Obviously it stresses the needs of regional Australia, but it also looks after outer metropolitan areas.</para></talk.start><para>This program was put in place some 18 months ago. It was done not because one day the government decided to see just what it might be able to do for regional Australia but because some five or six years ago the Deputy Prime Minister called a Regional Australia Summit. Quite obviously the members of the opposition do not like the fact that Regional Partnerships is an incredibly successful program. It is probably the most popular program in Australia today, perhaps second to or running in conjunction with Roads to Recovery, which is also something this government brought in. This area having been ignored by Labor for 13 years, Roads to Recovery, like Regional Partnerships, is out there expressly to help people who desperately need it.</para><para>Some five years ago the Deputy Prime Minister, who was then the minister for regional services, called a summit of some 200 or 300 people from right around Australia. As a matter of fact, I was there in the guise of an agropolitician, representing farmers from around Australia. I was one of those delegates. That conference, that gathering here in Canberra of people from right around regional Australia, looked at what was happening at a time when the efficiency driven rationalisation of farming in country Australia and unemployment were at their height and we needed to know what could be done about them. For three days those delegates were helped by people from government and from the universities of regional Australia to sort out their ideas. And they had ideas.</para><para>The government looked at the things that conference came up with that it, in partnership with the communities of regional Australia, could do to make things work, to get things going—to get the guts of regional Australia turned around and to help it go forward once again. There was a very strong call that there needed to be a mechanism that would enable our communities to build their own way ahead—a vehicle to help them help themselves and enable us to go forward and help them. It would be a leg-up, a new start, to address local needs.</para><para>What happened? The government listened to what 200 or 300 people from right around Australia said. We did not listen to bureaucrats; we did not listen to politicians; we listened to what the people out there said should happen. One of the many responses to the Regional Australia Summit was to develop a range of policies and programs, using examples of what people from Western Australia, northern Queensland, western New South Wales and places like Bendigo and Ballarat had been able to do for themselves. The particular areas that were addressed were health, education, jobs, capacity building and restructuring, where particular infrastructure had failed services or where particular industries were no longer viable in an area. </para><para>One of the key initiatives, one of the first responses, was the government's Regional Solutions Program, which enabled communities to apply for funds to work in community situations. Lo and behold, it was highly successful. It was the forerunner to Regional Partnerships. When the Regional Solutions Program reached the end of its life it became obvious that, in a partnership situation, we could help regional Australia rebuild itself—that we could make an enormous difference. Eighteen months ago Regional Partnerships was born. It brought together the government's key regional development programs, including the Regional Solutions Program, the Regional Assistance Program—RAP—the Rural Transaction Centres program and the government's specially targeted structural adjustment initiatives. The aim of it was to strengthen economic growth and help with services and regional planning—to give people an opportunity to help themselves. Major structural change was enabled by it. One of the major things to come out of Regional Partnerships is that it helps creates new jobs. People help themselves create new jobs.</para><para>I do not think it will come as a surprise, even to those opposite, to learn that this government is a huge supporter of regional development. We believe in it. We believe in supporting the regions. Agriculture, even without mining, is still responsible for creating nearly one-quarter of Australia's exports. Through Regional Partnerships and as a result of that original summit we continue to respond to what regional Australia wants—to the needs of country people in towns, in the bush and all around the country. The rationalisation that has occurred in the last 10 to 20 years has been absolutely enormous, with environmental change and major economic and social change. All we have done is respond to that, and we have responded very well.</para><para>I guess it is hard for those opposite, because they never tried to do anything about it. They never made any attempt to find out what the problems were in the first place and they certainly did not attempt to address them. What makes Regional Partnerships so successful? It is not just us on our own or the communities on their own. It is the local communities, the local government, the local councils, the Commonwealth and your friends the state government who are supporting Regional Partnerships. Every $1 that we put into a Regional Partnerships program is on average attracting $3 more. Some of that, I grant you, is state money. Your political colleagues, if I may call them that, around the country obviously see what a beneficial tool Regional Partnerships is, how necessary it is and what a heck of a good job it is doing. We are not only helping to create jobs, we are stimulating local economies. More than anything, what we are doing is working. I think that is what is upsetting you: it works, we invented it, we made sure that we listened to the communities and we pushed it forward. Even your own political colleagues are working with us to help make it work.</para><para>While those on the other side do not like it, the main reason that I think we are standing here today talking about this is that they would like very much to divert the government, the parliament and certainly Australia from their own problems. What better thing to do than try to attack one of the most successful programs any government has ever devised? So they start a Senate inquiry, which is quite obviously nothing more than a witch-hunt. It has tried to discredit the integrity of this program, which I have demonstrated is one of the more successful programs that has ever been created. </para><para>I heard the member for Wills not long ago talking about the fact that 78 per cent of these projects go through. So he is assuming that not enough are being applied for. What he totally misunderstands—he understands nothing about the whole program—is that the ACCs try to help people in their attempts to make applications. The department helps people in their attempts to make applications. Those that are wildly unlikely to get up never see the light of day, because it is pointed out that they are not appropriate. Seventy-eight per cent is a very creditable figure when you realise that a lot of people are being steered the right way from the start: 1,111 projects, roughly $202 million worth, have been submitted; 674, $150 million worth, have been assessed; 522, $125 million worth, have been approved; 152 have not been approved; and 169 have been withdrawn. Why have they been withdrawn? Why are they not part of the projects submitted? Because people were steered the right way in the beginning so that they did not waste their own time or the time of the department and the ACCs.</para><para>I seem to recall the member for Wills being astounded that the previous Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services who oversaw Regional Partnerships changed the departmental recommendation on 11 occasions. That is incredible. That is 11 out of 674 projects—something under two per cent. We are a government; we are not a part of a department. If departments got everything right all the time then we would not have governments. We are elected to do a job. The minister or the parliamentary secretary is elected to make an assessment. I think two per cent or 11 out of 674 is such a low figure that, given most projects and most ministerial intervention, it almost does not exist. The statement by the member for Wills would be one of the most ridiculous statements made in this House for a long time by anybody—shadow minister or otherwise.</para><para>I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the opposition—be it the new Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wills or anyone else—are simply trying to divert the attention of Australians from their own troubles by attacking one of the most successful programs around at the moment. It is also very sad that they choose to attack a project which is bringing so much help to so many people.</para><para>When local governments, communities, charitable organisations and corporate citizens are throwing money into projects around Australia at a rate of $3 for every dollar the Commonwealth puts in, I do not think that sounds like a program that is being rorted. That sounds like a program that is needed and that is doing one heck of a job around Australia. It is an active program; it is working; it is popular; and it is a proven process.</para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, let me tell you as someone who administers that process that it is exhaustive. The way that projects are given due diligence—given that we are very aware that we are dealing with tax dollars from people who obviously are not going to benefit from Regional Partnerships—is an exhaustive process.</para><para>I also think it is particularly sad that in this chamber we hear members of the opposition drag up the names of departmental officials who work their guts out and who do a hell of a job. The opposition could not care less whether that is embarrassing to a person who has done nothing but their job and who has done it well. It is very sad to drag up their name in the public arena; it is a shame. In fact, I think it is disgraceful.</para><para>We are talking about a program which delivers jobs and which helps restructuring, health and services. The member for Wills seems to have left us for the moment. He does not like to listen to anybody, except himself. I would like to challenge him on a few projects. The Flat Bottle project is in his own electorate, strangely enough. I would like to hear him tell those people that he does not support the $150,000 of Regional Partnerships funding for the Social Firm Management Group for the Flat Bottle Co. project. I would like to hear him go to the member for Grey's electorate in South Australia and say to PY Media that he does not support the PY Network project in one of the most disadvantaged areas in Australia. I would like him go to the town of Cobar in my electorate and tell the people there that they do not need a medical centre. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>95</page.no><name role="metadata">Kerr, Duncan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KERR</name><name.id>RH4</name.id><electorate>Denison</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have seen the purported defence of the indefensible. There is no doubt that the Regional Partnerships program was massively rorted. It is a disgrace of public administration. Look at the simple things that have been established. There is the conflict of interest in the office of the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Mr Crooke was employed in her office whilst also making representations on behalf of a beneficiary in the A2 Milk scandal. Look at the instances where the minister overrode the department, with no rationale being established. It is entirely contrary to the way in which the AuditorGeneral said these matters should be administered. Look at the absurd malapportionment and the inexplicable distribution of the funds across Australia.</para></talk.start><para>We have reached a point where, for the first time, Australian parliamentarians who travel to Papua New Guinea will not be able to adopt any superior airs when they look at the schemes that have been adopted in Papua New Guinea for discretionary funds—where each member of parliament is given discretionary funds to allocate as they will—because in this country the government is allocating funds as it will, with entire indifference to its opposition. Where the government spent money in Labor seats, it did so to secure victory in marginal seats—Bass is the best example. The government did not distribute funds fairly across the board to seats; it did it with an eye specifically to its own electoral advantage.</para><para>What about the extraordinary way in which the latest scandal has been revealed about Tumbi Creek? The member for Dobell announced that program about a fortnight before an application was made. I call that the Nostradamus defence—the capacity to look into the future and anticipate an application being made and the minister approving it. I suspect that the member for Dobell is actually the secret author of `Mystic Medusa',<inline font-style="italic"></inline>the horoscope that appears every weekend in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline>. He wrote his own horoscope in the last issue on 5-6 February. The member's birthday makes him an Aquarian. This is his horoscope:</para><quote><para>The usual old <inline font-style="italic">merde</inline> disguised as a New Deal. ...

The grant was to clear the blockage at the mouth of a creek—$1.5 million to dredge that sand out and take it to a tip. But what happens between the seeking of the grant and its request is massive rainfall, so the mouth of the creek is unblocked. There is no requirement to do the dredging—a problem because, plainly, the council anticipated that they would have to seek a reallocation of the funds. But what happens? The minister's office intervenes to tell them, `Don't do that because, were you to do that, we would have to reduce your funding or you might not get it at all.' So there is a conspiracy engaged in wherein the council is asked to provide false information about the state of the creek. </para><para>What is this akin to? Even assuming there was some propriety in the grant, is it not like the situation where a person discovers a theft of their property, makes an insurance claim and then, perhaps a fortnight later, discovers that he actually misplaced that which he had claimed—but there is a conspiracy between him and his friends not to disclose that to the insurance company? Is that not fraud? Of course it is. And it is fraud not only with respect to our common understanding. Plainly, were these facts to be established as we understand them—in a debate such as this we can only hypothesise rather than make direct allegations—there are a number of offences under the Criminal Code which appear to be apposite. Section 134.2, on obtaining financial advantage through deception, sets out the fault elements of that crime. The physical element is that the `Defendant induces a person to believe a thing is true'—that is, that the creek is still blocked. The fault element requires `Intention', and plainly there was intention. For the physical element that the representation is `False', the fault element requires `Intention or Recklessness'. The physical element is that `A third party obtains a financial advantage from a Commonwealth entity'. The fault element ultimately requires `Dishonesty'.</para><para>Assume for a moment that there was doubt about the applicability of that section; there could hardly be any doubt about the applicability of section 135.1, `General Dishonesty'. General dishonesty simply requires in the physical element of conduct that the `Defendant does something' with the `Intention (of dishonestly obtaining a gain from another person who is a C'wealth entity)'. When we speak of `conduct' and `doing things', remember that the Criminal Code defines conduct and engaging in conduct as either performing or omitting to perform an act. So remaining silent when you know that the department believes the creek is still blocked, or putting forward representations to the effect that it remains blocked when you know it is not, clearly comes under that heading.</para><para>Then you have provisions under section 135.2, `Obtaining a financial advantage'. Those provisions state:</para><quote><para>The following elements are for the offence of obtaining a financial advantage for <inline font-style="italic">another</inline>:</para><para>1. Physical Element (`conduct')<inline font-weight="bold">	Defendant induces the C</inline>'wealth entity to do something</para><para>Fault Element 	Intention</para><para>2. Physical Element (`result of conduct')	A third party received a financial advantage from the C'wealth</para><para>Fault Element	Knowledge or Belief (that the third party is ineligible to receive that financial advantage)</para></quote><para>Of course, there are other offences, such as conspiracy to defraud when conducted not by a single person but, as it appears in this instance, by a number of parties engaging together to have the Commonwealth make payments to which they are no longer entitled. Section 135.4(1), conspiracy to obtain a gain, and section 135.4(7), conspiracy to influence a Commonwealth official, would apply.</para><para>Then there are provisions in relation to false or misleading statements and applications. There are a number of different offences in relation to that. But, if you make a statement with the intention to do so, if that statement is false and misleading, if that statement omits a matter or thing and you have knowledge of that, and if you have made that statement in relation to an application for a claim for benefit or you are reckless with regard to that, then you commit that crime. Under section 137.1 `False or misleading information', there are a number of provisions about simply giving `information to another'. The intention must be to provide that information, where the information is `false or misleading' and omits a `matter or thing', you have knowledge of that and the other person is a Commonwealth entity. </para><para>There are serious matters that not only this House but no doubt law enforcement will be looking at to examine whether or not the matters described in this House today are made out. But the Prime Minister, like Diogenes, walking around the stews of the National Party seeking the honest man, seems blind to the obvious. Not a single sparrow will fall. Not a single minor minister will be drawn into a breach of the ministerial code.

Harold Wilson famously said that a week is a long time in politics. Well, if a week is a long time, what a difference four months make. Four months ago all members of this House would have been actively engaged on election day. In 45 minutes time, the first results would have come through from Tasmania. It was the day that the Australian people cast their judgment on who they wanted to lead Australia over the next three years.</para></talk.start><para>I remember the message at that time was that Labor was ready to lead. What I found during the Christmas break and over January was that one of the questions that constituents would pose was: `What if Labor had won?' It is worth thinking about: what if the Labor Party had won? Usually that question elicits chuckles and a little bit of mirth. Other constituents have said that one of the great joys in life for them is waking up, listening to the ABC news, lying in bed in the morning and just chuckling at the latest episode in the saga and soap opera that is the Australian Labor Party.</para><para>One of the key questions that was asked and answered during the federal election campaign was: `Who do you trust to manage an $800 billion economy?' Our message very consistently was: it takes focus; it takes discipline; it takes a good record to run a complex, large Australian economy. People cast their judgments. Politics is a competitive business and the job of the opposition is to mount the argument that they could administer the country and the economy better than the government. As I said, people actually stop and say, `What if the Labor Party had won?' As we have seen the last four months unfolding, it is worth thinking about how Labor would have responded to the tsunami, for example. How would Labor have dealt with some of the challenges that are facing the Australian government now?</para><para>During the election campaign I found, like all members, that there were a couple of conversations that really stuck in my mind. One came fairly early in the campaign when a gentleman rang me and said that his father had always told him that he would be quite happy to have a Labor government but they were no good on foreign policy and they were no good on finance. I thought that sounded like our campaign and I said: `When did your father say this? That's incredible.' He said, `My father died in 1952.' What it shows you is that there are some perennials in Australian politics that do not change. Labor, in the view of the population, is always suspect on those issues. The issues in 2004 were the economy and national security. </para><para>This is a MPI on the subject of administration. It is worth going back and looking at Labor's track record on administration. I found it an amazing conjunction of events when we had the devastation of the tsunami on 26 December 2004 and then on 1 January 2005 the National Archives released the cabinet records from 1974. Of course, one of the things in 1974 was Cyclone Tracy on Christmas Eve. John Menadue reported that Gough Whitlam was reluctant to return from an overseas trip. His quote went something like: `If I have to put up with the—expletive deleted—caucus, I will have my trips.' It was a reminder of how 30 years ago a previous member for Werriwa dealt with a natural disaster. It was a reminder of how a Labor government approached a natural disaster in Australia. People are welcome to draw their own conclusions there.</para><para>More recently, we can go to the Hawke-Keating years. Another one of the key questions—and Labor is trying to morph it into something else—was, as we asserted, that interest rates are always higher under a Labor government. That was what we said, and Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, is trying to say that we were talking about the movement of interest rates. All we said was that interest rates are always higher under a Labor government. That is because the trade union movement has too much influence in the Labor Party and because Labor governments spend more than they collect. Those are the principal reasons. Interest rates reached 17 per cent under the Labor Party and averaged 12 per cent. That was over the Hawke-Keating years.</para><para>Of course, the famous example of maladministration that everyone knows about was the whiteboard affair—the sports rorts affair—in which the administration was so slack that there were no records, and a channel of money was funnelled into Labor Party electorates. That was now 11 years ago. Centenary House is another example of a Labor rort where taxpayers' money has been channelled back into the Australian Labor Party to fund their election campaigns.</para><para>There have been some allegations about regional programs. The member for Wills made some allegations that the majority of funds flow to coalition electorates. There is a very good reason for that: the majority of rural electorates are held by the coalition. Out of 45 rural seats, 38 are held by the Liberal Party or by the National Party. If you add in provincial seats, almost three-quarters of them are held by the Liberal Party or by the National Party. I think an assertion was made that there was a very low number of applications coming from Labor Party seats. A very good question is why? We used to hear a bit from the Labor members for McMillan, Braddon and Paterson. They used to be trotted out as representatives of rural and regional Australia. Why were these Labor members not generating applications in their electorates? Labor used to hold seats in regional Australia. During the Hawke-Keating years from 1983 to 1996 I think they held as many rural and regional seats as the Liberal Party and the National Party did. People showed what they thought about that. People showed what they thought about their work level, their representation and their ability to deliver for their electorates when they tossed them out in 1996.</para><para>This shows that coalition members are much more in touch with the needs of their communities and they are much more active in supporting community-driven projects. Eight hundred applications came from coalition electorates compared with 205 from Labor electorates. What were the Labor members doing? I know that many members on this side who represent rural and regional areas go to a lot of effort to try to get their community groups to put in applications. We have heard a little bit about a creek in Dobell. We did not hear much in this MPI about the turtle interpretation centre which the Labor Party committed $1½ million towards. It had already secured funding from the state and local government authorities. No approach had been made to the Australian government, yet the Labor Party announced $1½ million to the turtle interpretation centre. Of course, they matched the funding for the creek in Dobell. They announced $150 million for a rail line in Richmond, $1 million for a national centre of democracy in Ballarat, $10 million for a national museum in Cairns, $1 million for something in Bundaberg, $3 million for Thuringowa and $6 million for the Rockhampton showgrounds. What applications were put in? What costings were done? In conclusion, it is the job of the opposition to hold the government to account, but the Labor Party's track record is very poor. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Australia House accommodates the Australian High Commission in London, as well as a number of federal and state government tenant agencies, including Department of Defence staff.</para><para>The building is not only Australia's oldest overseas mission but is also the oldest originally occupied chancery of any foreign mission in London. Officially opened in 1918, Australia House has served Australians at home and in the United Kingdom without interruption since that time. It is located in London's West End, so is readily accessible to the many thousands of Australians who visit each year and to those who wish to visit or migrate to Australia. Australia House is therefore a prestigious and centrally located asset well worth preserving.</para><para>While the building has been well maintained over its lifetime, changes in internal functions of accommodated staff and environmental effects over almost 90 years have rendered it inevitable that a substantial refurbishment is required. To this end, an initial refurbishment project was undertaken in the late 1990s. The works now proposed are those priority areas remaining, comprising external works to the three building core light wells and internal works to the fourth-level accommodation of the Australian Defence staff. </para><para>The light wells are the most difficult areas of Australia House to access and the areas most in need of refurbishment to overcome water ingress and general facia deterioration. A substantial temporary structure will need to be erected to provide access. The level-four works are intended to occur concurrently in order to get the maximum use out of this structure. This not only achieves a reasonable construction synergy, but it also avoids logistic and security concerns that would otherwise be associated with having to access level four internally through Australia House. The scope of the proposed works will include the following:</para><para>	erection of a temporary scaffold and hoist structure outside Australia House, and inside the light wells, for movement of personnel, equipment and material;</para><para>	construction of temporary accommodation on the top building floors for Defence staff while their fourth level is refurbished;</para><para>	refurbishment of the fourth level of the building, including base building services and fit-out, after Defence staff have temporarily relocated;</para><para>	refurbishment of the light wells, comprising replacement of single glaze windows and frames with double glaze units of similar appearance, repair and replacement of damaged brickwork, face tiles and cast iron pipe work, and high pressure cleaning generally; and</para><para>	removal of scaffold and hoists after completion of refurbishment works.</para><para>The estimated cost of the new proposal is $11.98 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, these works are planned to commence in May 2006 and to be completed by mid-2007.

The role of the Defence Housing Authority is to provide suitable housing to meet the operational needs of the Australian Defence Force and the requirements of the Department of Defence.</para><para>The Defence Housing Authority satisfies Defence accommodation requirements through a mixture of: construction off-base, with a view to retaining the properties or selling them with a lease attached; construction on-base, to accord with Defence operational or policy requirements and/or if such construction is the most cost-effective for all concerned; direct purchase, with a view to retaining the properties or selling them with a lease attached; and direct lease from the private rental market. Of these options, only on-base construction is feasible at Puckapunyal. The housing market in the nearest town, Seymour, would be too readily distorted by Defence requirements and provides few amenities beyond those available on-base.</para><para>The project involves the construction of 80 three-bedroom houses on previously occupied residential sites that are presently vacant. Infrastructure works are not required. The proposed project will have a positive effect on the local economy during the construction period, not only through persons working directly on the site but also through the off-site supply of material, plant and equipment. The construction of these new dwellings on-base at Puckapunyal is not expected to affect either the sale or rental markets for residential accommodation in the neighbouring townships. The estimated cost of the proposal is $19.6 million. Subject to parliamentary and Defence Housing Authority board approval, the construction program is expected to commence in July this year, with the delivery of completed dwellings expected to occur progressively from February 2006 through to November 2006.

This is a critical piece of regional and national infrastructure. I simply say to the Howard government: quit playing politics with it and get on with the job. I have one other piece of advice for the minister and the government: good public policy outcomes and strong partnerships with other levels of government are never achieved in a lasting sense when one key party is motivated by vindictive ideological obsessions.</para></talk.start><para>It has been a strongly held belief of mine that Australia's transport infrastructure is a major determinant of its economic growth. That is why I have despaired at the wasted years of the Howard government in this very important area of public policy. In my shadow ministerial portfolio responsibilities I have often taken a particular interest in the struggle by rural communities for road funding. One such involvement in recent years was with the community of Ungarra on the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia to secure funding to complete a local road for that community. I note that the Eyre Peninsula was recently devastated by bushfires, with significant loss of life, and I wish the people of Ungarra well in their recovery from the bushfires. They are proud, resilient and decent country people, and I am sure they will come through this disaster with a stronger community.</para><para>In my own community in the Geelong region I am very proud of the achievements of past and present Labor governments, both federal and state, in ensuring that the region's transport infrastructure positions the Geelong area for future economic growth. It was a federal Labor government that contributed funding to the dual carriageway on the Bellarine Highway which now services Leopold, Drysdale, Clifton Springs and other coastal towns on the Bellarine Peninsula. It was a federal Labor government that contributed substantially to the dual carriageway between Geelong and the Great Ocean Road at Torquay, which has underpinned massive tourism and residential growth along the Great Ocean Road. It was the Bracks government and the federal opposition, led by Kim Beazley at the time, that made the public financial commitment to the third lane on the Princes Highway between Geelong and Melbourne, forcing the federal coalition to match our funding commitment. It was the Bracks Labor government that was the first to commit funding to the Geelong bypass. I commend the contributions of my state Labor parliamentary colleagues and their efforts in securing that commitment, which was the catalyst for the eventual commitment made by the Howard government. Transport issues have dominated the Geelong political scene over the 11 years I have been the member for Corio, and I have been pleased to play my part, on behalf of my constituents, in the lobbying efforts to secure funding from all levels of government for these important projects. </para><para>We on this side of the House will be supporting the broad intent of this legislation. Why wouldn't we? After all, we went to the 2001 election with a detailed proposal for a national land transport plan. There are several key proposals that have formed the core of Labor's policy in opposition since 1996, and we intend to insist on them again during this term—namely, the setting of national transport infrastructure priorities for road and rail, the pursuit of an integrated planning approach to the land transport task, the construction of genuine partnerships with other levels of government to achieve national outcomes, the pursuit of a long-term funding framework that exists beyond the half lives of governments at various levels and the integration of the transport task with other social and environmental objectives.</para><para>The past behaviour of the Howard government in this policy area gives the opposition grave concern about the administration of AusLink and transport policy. We are not convinced that the government is really committed to a national land transport plan and funding according to agreed priorities. We have little confidence that the government will not rort substantial slabs of the land transport budget for its own political ends, as has occurred in other regional programs—as, dare I say it, revealed by the Leader of the Opposition today in question time. Even a cursory reading of the minister's second reading speech indicates that there is significant potential for the government to rort the land transport budget again.</para><para>There is disturbing evidence of the government's intention to once again dodge its fiscal responsibility in the transport area and cost shift to Labor states in a systematic way. It is also disturbing to note that, in order to peddle its own ideological obsessions and prejudices, the government intends abusing the important partnership required with state Labor governments to undertake these projects. The Victorian government did not come to the table with over $190 million worth of funding for the Geelong ring-road project and make the federal contribution contingent on certain provisions if funding was to proceed, so why is the federal government seeking to do that with state Labor governments?</para><para>The government's use of its purchasing power to achieve its ideological objectives in the construction industry through its so-called code of practice is a case in point. This code of practice has no legislative sanction and can be changed at whim by the government. There is no independent review of the code's application within government and its potential impact on legally certified agreements struck under the Workplace Relations Act, and there is no independent review of the impact on employers who wish to tender for projects but have struck such legal agreements that may be non-compliant with the code. Yet the government has been prepared to put in jeopardy key infrastructure projects for the Geelong region—and others—for the sake of pursuing its own ideological obsessions and political prejudices.</para><para>With regard to Australian agriculture and fisheries, the efficiency of the road transport task is critical to the long-term prosperity of many of our key rural industries, such as meat, grains, sugar, dairy and horticulture, and to rural communities which depend on them for their ongoing viability. The nation's export performance and competitiveness in agriculture depends heavily on the achievement of greater efficiencies in the transport task. We do expect that in regional areas the government will fund key land transport infrastructure projects that will deliver over the long term the sorts of economic efficiencies that underpin our great rural and fishing industries and lead at the end of the day to greater prosperity for all Australians. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>106</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2237">AusLink (National Land Transport—Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004</inline> underscore Labor's concerns about this government's approach to management of the nation's infrastructure and to management of Australia's economy more generally. This is a government where political considerations take priority over considerations relating to Australia's national interest. It is a government where short-term fixes take precedence over long-term economic and social needs. It is a complacent government that wants to take credit for our current prosperity—which is the fruit of a long period of reforms—but has neither the vision nor the backbone to take the decisions that will build Australia's future prosperity.</para></talk.start><para>It is interesting that more and more often in the community now people are accepting the view that our long period of prosperity is in large measure a product of the decisions—controversial and difficult in their day—that were taken by the Hawke and Keating governments. This government has benefited enormously from that prosperity and now it has squandered it. In all the indices of those measures that we put in place when we were in office you can see that Australia is going backwards where we once went forwards. The figures associated with exports show under this government a rate of growth that is half what it was when we were in office. Research and development funding in the business sector collapsed for the first few years of operation of this government. It is only just beginning to trend upwards now, while all our competitors have been on a non-stop trajectory upwards. There has been a collapse in skills—and in traditional areas that has been worst of all.</para><para>As it is with infrastructure, so it is with training. This government loves the political atmosphere. It is tremendously good with words and political positioning but appalling with the delivery of outcomes. In the skills area, for example, we had the modern apprenticeship training system, which simply concealed the collapse of traditional trades. And now, if you go to the mining companies in my home town, they will not have a conversation with you about indiscipline in their work forces; they will say to you very directly, `We will not invest and we cannot invest because we cannot get a work force.' They cannot get it here and they cannot bring it in from overseas. It is not available—the welders are not there; the electricians are not there. An electrician in a Western Australian mining town now will earn between $150,000 and $200,000 a year. The mining companies have no capacity to do the work that they need to do, because they do not have the resources that need to be there to do it.</para><para>The other area is national infrastructure, and this comes back to this bill. The OECD report that was out last week simply repeats what I have had to say in my opening remarks on this bill. That OECD report was very critical of this government. It was critical of this government in two key areas: skills, which I have already mentioned, and infrastructure. It is not as though money is not spent; it is just how it is spent. Again, it is not part of a national plan targeted to real areas of need; it is part of a national scheme of pork-barrelling targeted at political concerns of the Commonwealth.</para><para>You cannot do this over a lengthy period of time without the nation paying a penalty. Day by day, we are hearing more about the crisis in infrastructure facing this nation. We hear about problems that are emerging in the crucial infrastructure networks that help make Australia efficient and competitive in the global economy—problems such as roads, ports, water, communications, energy and other crucial aspects of the nation's infrastructure. We are facing serious economic constraints; the long-term effects of years of short-term, politically driven policy making are beginning to hit home. </para><para>That is why I want to comment on this bill. Rather than coming to terms with the nation's infrastructure problems and the lack of strategic planning that has caused them, this government now plans to make matters worse. As the member for Wills said in his comments to this House yesterday, this is the latest instalment in a sorry tale of the progressive collapsing of the nation's infrastructure spending into a series of National Party slush funds. We have seen it before. In the environment we have seen it with the Natural Heritage Trust. In communications we have seen it with Networking the Nation. In roads we have seen it with Roads of National Importance. We have seen it with the Regional Partnerships program. And now we see a complacent government planning to entrench its self-interested political decision making in this bill.</para><para>Contemplate the programs I have been talking about—every one of them surrounded by verbiage of fine words and the right sentiments with the mobilisation of community sentiment behind them. Every one of them—to the tune of tens of millions of dollars—is targeted to support a short-term political outcome, not a long-term benefit for the nation. You cannot do that without damaging your country in the end. It is smart politics while it lasts—God knows the government is very rarely internally inspected through the accountability processes around this town—but sooner or later the chickens come home to roost, and they are cackling away in the yard now as we look at the bare bones of the infrastructure strategies of this government.</para><para>Distance has always been a critical element of the story of this nation's development. We have never enjoyed the advantage that many of our trading partners have—of large populations living in close proximity to other well-populated countries providing ready access to markets for their goods and services. We have always lived with great distances between our heavily populated areas and, of course, with great distances between our country and our friends and neighbours. This means that infrastructure planning has always been a crucially important element in our national development. Good planning and prudent investment can overcome challenges of distance. Without clear-sighted, long-term planning for the needs of growing populations and industries, we experience the bottlenecks and strains on our infrastructure that we now face.</para><para>What we need now is a process of objective, long-sighted planning of our nation's infrastructure needs. We need a government that is willing to work cooperatively with the states and act in the national interest. We do not need another slush fund to allow the nation's limited resources to be diverted into white elephant projects in marginal National Party electorates. But that is exactly what this bill proposes with the AusLink Strategic Regional Projects fund. People should learn to be fearful when they hear those sorts of words associated with any government proposition. This $150 million fund gives the minister wide discretion as to how to allocate those funds, on top of the AusLink Roads to Recovery program, which similarly gives the minister virtual free rein on spending decisions.</para><para>Make no mistake about it: this is a story in which there are more losers than winners. When crucial infrastructure funds are being diverted for pork-barrelling for National Party politicians, the people who bear the costs of those decisions are the families spread throughout the vast suburban areas of our major cities. These are the people who live in the exploding suburbs where a failure of long-term planning means that the infrastructure networks and services that they rely on from day to day are too often stretched to breaking point. They have to cope with the daily grind of battling through congested roads where the Commonwealth fails to live up to its national responsibilities. </para><para>People in areas like Campbelltown and Liverpool, which I visited last week, have to put up with overstretched infrastructure every day of their lives—their roads, transport links, hospitals and schools. They are the people who are losing out because this government is more concerned with National Party politicians than with ordinary families. They have to live with the inconvenience and disruption to family life that occurs when you cannot find a bulk-billing GP after hours, when the hospital emergency room is miles away and always overcrowded or when a failure to coordinate transport effectively means that they waste hours every week in travelling between home, work and schools. They are the people who are forgotten when this government is forking out millions of dollars on projects that would not get a look-in if there was a fair, objective process for funding our infrastructure needs. The people in areas like Campbelltown and Liverpool would at least get a fair hearing if we had a fair, objective process for deciding how to allocate our spending on crucial infrastructure. But they do not get a look-in because they are not located in a National Party electorate.</para><para>The government's neglect of those families is so great that with this by-election coming up in the seat of Werriwa it cannot even decide whether it will bother to field a candidate. `We do not need Werriwa,' said some unnamed Liberal Party official. Those opposite do not need an electorate where there may be a challenge to what they nefariously intend to do with the resources that are allocated by the Commonwealth. In Werriwa, people face a choked up M5 motorway each day. That road was part of the former national highway network—the national responsibility that this government is now walking away from. Under this bill the government no longer accepts full responsibility for maintaining those roads. Instead, the government proposes to cap its maintenance commitment to our national highway network at $300 million a year. This government is walking away from its obligations to families in Campbelltown and Liverpool while it sets up a $150 million slush fund for the National Party.</para><para>Our federal system requires national leadership and a national strategy that can ensure that our infrastructure supports our economic growth rather than constraining it. Infrastructure is a linchpin of economic prosperity. That is why Labor advocates a national infrastructure advisory council that can examine and advise on the nation's infrastructure priorities, free of interference from politicians, so that the nation can enjoy the best economic and social outcomes from its infrastructure investments. That is why Labor believes we need a cooperative approach to working with the states and territories to solve infrastructure bottlenecks rather than playing them off against each other, or using roads funding to impose divisive industrial relations ideology on states and territories by refusing to fund road projects unless they follow Canberra's edicts.</para><para>There are elements of this legislation that we support. We support its long overdue attempt to link road and rail planning and to develop integrated corridor strategies for our land transport infrastructure. But we regret the government walking away from its national responsibilities by disowning its full responsibility for what was once formally called the national highway network. At a time when a decade of failed infrastructure policy is now holding our nation back, we can ill afford further indulgence of this government's preoccupation with politics over good policy. We will live for years with the consequences of failing to plan for the needs of our growing industries and our growing families. In infrastructure, bad policy making cannot be reversed overnight. That is why we urge this government to put the nation's interests ahead of its own political interests and to waste no more time in putting in place a transparent, objective and fair framework for meeting Australia's infrastructure needs for now and our future. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>109</page.no><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name><name.id>8K6</name.id><electorate>Hunter</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to continue with the theme established by the Leader of the Opposition. If the <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> were a genuine attempt to improve and better integrate Australia's critical infrastructure it would have the overwhelming support of the opposition, and we would not have a second reading amendment before the House. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, the OECD report and the Reserve Bank statement, both of last week, have identified bottlenecks in our productive capacity as the biggest hurdle to our ongoing sustainable economic growth, as the biggest reason for our poor export performance and growing current account deficit and as applying the greatest pressure of all on interest rates in this country at the moment.</para></talk.start><para>Sadly, it is not the case that this bill represents a real and genuine attempt to integrate land transport infrastructure in this country, and that is very disappointing indeed. This bill is really about two things. First, it is to enhance the government's pork-barrelling potential. Second, it is to enhance the government's ability to shift many of its financial obligations and responsibilities onto the states and, in so doing, to provide themselves with an opportunity on every occasion to shift blame to the states, as they are so known to do. The government has long been frustrated by the constraints of the current road funding arrangements which, in addition to its contribution to the local road components of grants to local councils, leave it almost entirely responsible for the national highway network.</para><para>There is plenty of evidence around the place to back the allegation that this government has been slowly but surely siphoning funding for projects in marginal seats away from the national highway project. It has been taking money away from its key traditional responsibility and spending it on projects under the banner, in particular, of Roads of National Importance. This is not to say that the opposition does not see merit in some of the projects which have been funded under programs such as Roads of National Importance, but we still allege that there are many projects that, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, would never get a guernsey if they were exposed to proper scrutiny and competition from more worthy projects.</para><para>Let me share with the House just one example of the sort of skewed results that you get when you put politics in front of the economic and social needs of the Australian economy. I want to talk briefly about a project in my own electorate, commonly known as the Kurri Corridor, but more recently referred to as the link between the F3 freeway and the New England Highway just north of Branxton. When the Howard government won office in 1996, the F3 to Branxton project was on track and construction funding was expected by the end of that decade. Here we are halfway through the next decade and not one sod has been turned. Even worse, the AusLink proposal to broaden the Commonwealth's responsibilities for road funding at the expense of the national highway project will likely push funding for the F3 link out by another decade. </para><para>Let me share with the House the importance of this road project. It is a project that I have been fighting for since Easter 1988, long before coming to this place, when I was a councillor on Cessnock City Council. In Easter 1988 the then final section of the F3 freeway was opened to a little place called Freemans Waterhole. That became the dead end. From there all of that freeway traffic spilt onto the roads of the local government authority, causing both an economic and a social nightmare. So we as a community started lobbying for what is commonly called the Kurri Corridor. We were successful in getting the community's preferred route option for that project. We were very confident that the case had been made in economic terms to have construction funding allocated to that project by the end of the decade or by the year 2000. Alas, the Howard government was elected. In that first budget of 1996 in particular, it embarked on some massive funding cuts, which was of course very bad news for that project. And the bad news has been ongoing ever since, in particular as a result of the government's ongoing determination to siphon money away from the national highway project, which the Kurri Corridor would form part of, and onto other projects where it believes it can get a greater political benefit.</para><para>The Kurri Corridor would be of great benefit to the Hunter in economic terms, in social terms, in road transport terms and in safety terms. It would rid many towns in my electorate—including the major towns of Cessnock and Maitland and smaller towns like Greta and Lochinvar, which are long-term sufferers—of the heavy vehicle traffic and the noise it creates as a result of the government's failure not to fund this project. I note that numerous economic studies have been undertaken that confirm the fact that, in economic terms, the Kurri Corridor would be of great economic benefit to the Hunter region. It would bring our coal exports closer to the port and it would bring the whole region closer to Sydney. The benefits would also extend way beyond my electorate, indeed into the electorate of the Deputy Prime Minister and member for Gwydir, the architect of this flawed AusLink proposal; and into electorates to the west of mine, such Calare which produces much of the product other than coal that goes through the port of Newcastle.</para><para>So important is the F3 link to our local communities that in recent years a local community group known as `Link or Sink' has sprung up. It has been very active in lobbying both the Commonwealth and the state governments in an attempt to bring funding forward for this important project. Unfortunately, despite the fact that they have had a number of discussions with Minister Anderson and his underlings, they have been given no real hope that the government is about to change its attitude on this subject. The reality is that, under this funding proposal, an important road link such as the Kurri Corridor, which goes substantially if not wholly through the electorate of Hunter, which the government considers a safe seat, is not likely to enjoy priority over some of these other projects the government has in mind, which of course run through either opposition held marginal seats or government held seats. That highlights a major flaw in this bill, and conjures for us again the prospect of the National Party being ongoing in its attempt to allocate money not on the basis of economic or social benefit but on the basis of political benefit. If the government believes there is a better funding model for road funding, one that better delivers outcomes, then the opposition would be prepared to support it. If broadening the Commonwealth's responsibilities delivers better results, we would be more than happy to support the proposition. But such a plan is not contained within the bill before the House today. </para><para>Let me turn to some other bottlenecks that the Deputy Prime Minister has been making a habit of waxing lyrical about in this place in recent times: the bottlenecks involved in some of our important port facilities. AusLink is apparently about dealing, amongst other things, with local land transport links to ports. There is not much point getting the land transport links to the ports right if there is undercapacity at the ports themselves. These ports, like the port of Newcastle, are so critical to Australia's economic wellbeing and have been subject to some consideration in the Reserve Bank and OECD reports and by a range of economic commentators around this country.</para><para>The port of Newcastle is the lifeblood of the Hunter in economic terms. It is the nation's largest coal port, but one that is currently choked. It is choked to the point that it is not unusual to see 50 ships sitting off the coast of Newcastle—a problem that is costing the coal companies operating in the Hunter Valley up to $100 million annually in demurrage charges. To get the capacity of the port of Newcastle to a point capable of coping with the current demand for export coal out of the Hunter region—from the current 90-odd million tonnes to 120 million tonnes—would require expenditure of some $300 million, or just three year's worth of demurrage. Where is the economic sense in all of that?</para><para>I will not say that the port of Newcastle is unique, because similar problems exist off the Bowen Basin in Queensland, but it is a monopoly. The Leader of the Opposition just made the point that the Hawke-Keating reforms of the 1980s and 1990s, in particular the competition reforms of the 1990s, are what gave this economy the economic boost that has been sustained in all that time and which is now in its 14th year. It was competition reform that gave the Australian economy a boost over major economies like the US throughout the 1990s, and it is competition reform that has allowed the economy to better deal with capacity constraints and to better avoid upward pressure on interest rates. Unfortunately, there is not much competition in the port of Newcastle, and that is much to the detriment of the Hunter region's economy.</para><para>The monopoly port facility is run by Port Waratah Coal Services. Who owns Port Waratah Coal Services? Mainly, in majority terms, it is owned by the coalminers Rio Tinto and Xstrata. Despite the dramatic growth in demand for export coal in recent years, much of which was easily predicted given the growth in China in particular, no real expansion in capacity has taken place at that port. Instead, Port Waratah Coal Services has successfully secured authorisation from the ACCC to put a quota system in place which restricts competition by allocating a share of port capacity to each of the producers who seek to use it. This of course is a practice which (1) disadvantages the smaller producers, who are of course on all current predictions the producers seeking to grow fastest and (2) has the effect of allowing the big companies which control PWCS to stall capacity investment. It is obvious.</para><para>The quota system is an advantage to the big players for three reasons. One, the big players, subject to ACCC authorisation, effectively set the rules. Two, the big players can meet their contracts from other global projects. In a sense, they can sequence their projects and source coal to meet their contracts from other global projects. It is a luxury not enjoyed by the small players like Excel Mining, Centennial Coal, Donaldson Coal et cetera. Three, demurrage charges are a much greater burden on the smaller players than they are on the big players like Xstrata and Rio Tinto. </para><para>While this quota system has been responsible for reducing the queue of ships sitting off Newcastle in recent months, the quota system allows the monopolist PWCS, owned by the big players Rio Tinto and Xstrata, to defer investment to take advantage of the situation at the expense of smaller producers, the economy of the Hunter region and the national economy. The quota application provided the government, through its agency the ACCC, with an opportunity to secure commitments to that investment before issuing the authorisation. Smaller coal companies do not have a problem with the quota system per se, but they see it as an opportunity, a tool, used by the big players to defer investment, and they do not appreciate the fact that the government has failed to use the authorisation as an opportunity to at the same time get a commitment on investment. As I said, the Reserve Bank has identified these bottlenecks as being crucial to the ongoing economic capacity of our economy as a whole.</para><para>During question time, the Deputy Prime Minister in particular—and I think the Treasurer on one or two occasions—has been very quick to try to shift the blame for the problems in our port capacity onto the state governments. With respect to the Newcastle port, this is grossly unfair. The New South Wales government has done all in its power to improve the situation. The Deputy Prime Minister likes to remind us that ARTC has now taken control of the rail infrastructure that takes the coal to the port of Newcastle. I too think that that is a good thing and I look forward to this government, as the majority shareholder in ARTC, continuing to apply sufficient pressure on that organisation to invest what is necessary to get the rail infrastructure up to an appropriate capacity.</para><para>But there is no point in getting rail capacity up if the port capacity does not increase as well. The chain is only as strong as its weakest link. It is no good the Deputy Prime Minister coming in here crowing about what has been done in terms of the ownership of the rail infrastructure while refusing to concede any responsibility whatsoever for what is happening at the port of Newcastle. My message to the Deputy Prime Minister is this: `It's competition, stupid.' It is competition and it is only the Commonwealth government that can sort out the competition issues we are experiencing at the port of Newcastle.</para><para>We should not be surprised that the government is hesitant to do so. We have seen this government's attitude towards competition policy. We have seen its failure to take on another round of competition reform. We have seen its failure to embrace with any urgency the recommendations of the Dawson review, although it did not mind embracing pretty quickly those recommendations that suited the big end of town such as the softer merger laws. It has been reluctant to pick up the Senate committee's recommendations on a range of issues, but in particular on the strengthening of section 46.</para><para>I read a very interesting speech by Saul Eslake of the ANZ Bank recently—a speech he delivered to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission—in which he made the point, which I made earlier, that it is competition policy in this country that has given us our big lift in economic growth and capacity; it is competition policy that has given us a greater buffer against higher interest rates when we are reaching capacity in the economy; and it is competition policy that we must continue to pursue. It is now up to the Commonwealth government to have a good, hard look at what is happening in the port of Newcastle and act for a change to assist us in our problems there and to recover the $1.4 billion in sales we are losing annually as a result of its inaction. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>113</page.no><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WINDSOR</name><name.id>009LP</name.id><electorate>New England</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to support the <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> and the cognate bill, but there are a number of concerns I would like to raise in relation to infrastructure generally. Before getting into my speech, I would just like to comment on one of the things that the member for Hunter raised. I would agree with him in relation to the port of Newcastle. As a state member in the north-west and New England area, and as the federal member for New England, I have had quite a lot to do with the Newcastle Port Authority, the Newcastle Business Chamber and other groups in Newcastle that are interested in the development of the port and the relationship that the port has with the various areas around it. The member for Parkes is here, too; he would be well aware of the relationship between Dubbo and the central west area and Newcastle and also the Tamworth-Gunnedah area in relation to Newcastle.</para></talk.start><para>One of the things that really needs to be addressed is the infrastructure needs of the Newcastle port and the importance it has to the northern and western parts of inland New South Wales. One of the pieces of infrastructure that is not mentioned in the AusLink documents is the Murrurundi tunnel. I am sure the member for Hunter would agreed that that is a very important piece of infrastructure that needs to be addressed at both a state and a federal level if we are going to develop the port of Newcastle and the coal industry north of the Liverpool Range in the electorates of Gwydir and New England.</para><para>Having said that, obviously I think all of us in this chamber recognise that the AusLink white paper and subsequent legislation do an important thing. They attempt to integrate the road and rail networks nationally, and I think that is significant in itself. We will all argue that there is not enough money in there, and I would argue that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services has probably exploded the funding arrangements in terms of how many Snowy Mountain schemes are actually in this particular document compared with what is historical fact, but there is no doubt that there is more money and there is an attempt to integrate road and rail and, in some cases, to link in with the ports. I would say that there is not enough in relation to Newcastle, of course, but I congratulate the minister on having a national approach to this particular problem. It is a problem in that we are continually building roads and rail has been ignored, and I think we are seeing the added impact of some of the road building schemes without looking at integration totally.</para><para>I am a supporter of the inland rail link that has been talked about for some years, and I think that this document, particularly the agreement through the Australian Rail Track Corporation—the $872 million that was signed off between the state of New South Wales and the Commonwealth government—is an important move forward in relation to that particular agenda. But we really do need the government to put more in and react in a much more positive sense than it has in recent years to that particular project, because, if we are talking about infrastructure in inland Australia, we will have to have a rail system that can actually work right across the inland of Australia and take goods into Darwin and back to Sydney and Melbourne.</para><para>There are a few comments that I would like to make. Obviously I do not think anybody in this parliament would suggest that the funding arrangements in AusLink are sufficient. I do not think any member of the government would argue that the infrastructure needs of Australia are going to be covered sufficiently in AusLink, otherwise there would not be members of the government—and one of those members of the government, the member for Parkes, is at the table at the moment—arguing that there is a need to sell a very important piece of infrastructure, Telstra, to fund other infrastructure. I have very great concerns that an agenda is building up in parts of regional Australia—and Dubbo is one of those areas where that agenda is growing—where moves are afoot to actually push for the sale of Telstra so that road and rail can be sufficiently funded in regional Australia. That says to me straightaway that, even though this legislation recognises the need to integrate and the obvious benefits downstream of integration, there is not sufficient money. </para><para>I caution Mr Roger Fletcher, one of the major sheepmeat processors in Australia, about being used as a puppet in developing an argument to sell Telstra to fund other infrastructure. It is an insult to country people to say that they cannot have the infrastructure they require and that the only way they will get it is to sell some other infrastructure. I think all of us would know that in this century telecommunications is going to be the most important piece of infrastructure in regional Australia. It is the very piece of infrastructure that negates distance as being a disadvantage of living in a country area. It removes smallness as being a disadvantage in terms of size. If you get equity of access and equity of cost—and I believe you have to have government involvement to achieve that, because the private market will not provide that—only then will country people out-compete their city cousins in terms of their location. I think a nasty agenda is being developed—and I would caution the member for Parkes on his involvement in it—to promote the sale of a significant piece of infrastructure to fund another piece and to say to people that that is the only way they are going to get sufficient funds to provide the infrastructure that they require. We all know that there are other ways of achieving those outcomes.</para><para>One of the other issues that I would raise is the Roads to Recovery program, and I compliment the minister and the government on it. I think there is no doubt that that has been a successful program. I was very pleased—just prior to or during the election campaign, I cannot remember quite when—to see that the government moved back to a similar system, where the full $300 million was going to be treated on an equitable basis across all local government areas. The original proposal was that $200 million would be treated under a similar formula to that of the previous Roads to Recovery program—a successful program in my view—and $100 million would be opened up to the discretion of government.</para><para>We have had a debate today and there is a debate going on in the Senate about these sorts of discretionary lumps of money. There is no doubt that there is a politicisation of the process or, at best, that it allows possible tampering, even though that may not be going on to the extent that some people might like to think it is. Those sorts of schemes allow people to develop their own thought processes about transparency, whereas the original Roads to Recovery program was a very fair program. It went out to all local government areas. The locals made the decisions on the ground. There was no way that the bureaucracy or the state government—and I applaud the federal government for bypassing the states in that sense—or the minister could have an impact on the direction of that funding. I think Roads to Recovery is a successful program and should be looked at as a bit of a model for other programs in the future. </para><para>I remember being involved as a state member, again, in the campaign to get more money for local roads. I will just highlight for a moment the importance of unity. I note with great interest that the Australian Local Government Association is currently embarking on a program to achieve one per cent of income tax to go back to local government—a much more transparent scheme, again, that would allow some growth as the economy grows, as the income tax receipts grow, so that more of that money could flow to local government—rather than the very archaic system we have now. I congratulate the President of the Australian Local Government Association, Councillor Bell, for his initiative. I urge all members to support that initiative, because if it is supported through a whole range of organisations I have no doubt that it will be successful.</para><para>I will just take people back to the genesis of the Roads to Recovery program. A meeting was held from 5 to 8 March 2000 in Moree, in the current minister's seat of Gwydir. He was the minister then, too, I think. The meeting was under the auspices of the Deputy Prime Minister; he had encouraged the meeting to occur. It was about creating solutions: a National Rural Roads Congress. It was put on under the auspices of the Australian Local Government Association.</para><para>One of the things that disturbed me at the time in the advertisements for and promotion of the program—and the Deputy Prime Minister was involved in its promotion—was as follows. This congress was coming together to look at how road infrastructure was going to be funded in the next 20 to 50 years, at how this money was to be provided. That was a very worthy question. But one of the things that concerned me greatly, and I was critical at the time, was that in the documents that were circulated a statement was made: `It is clearly not going to be funded from current sources of funds.' That was suggesting to local government, from the federal level, that local government would receive no more money from the fuel tax receipts than they were getting, so the congress should look at other ways of achieving funding arrangements: private-public partnerships and those sorts of arrangements. The signal was sent from government at that stage: `Don't expect any more from fuel taxation receipts.'</para><para>I think at that stage something like $800 million of Commonwealth funds was being spent on roads. Obviously that was not enough. That is a bit over 2c a litre at the bowser, and I think we are all aware that we are paying 38c and then there is GST on top of that. It was a little bit over 2c a litre, and the government was saying at the time through the Deputy Prime Minister: `Don't expect any more.'</para><para>The Australian Local Government Association did not accept that. To their credit, they argued that more receipts should be made available, particularly for local roads, as there was a real maintenance problem developing in terms of infrastructure. To their credit, they were able to come out with what is now the very successful program called Roads to Recovery.</para><para>I raise that today because I think the Australian Local Government Association, having been successful in getting the Roads to Recovery program up, are now on the cusp of getting another successful program up if they really lobby hard and apply the political pressure that is required. I encourage them to do that to the best of their intent, because the one per cent income tax receipts that are being talked about are a very worthy goal. </para><para>When you start to look at the $11.8 billion included in this AusLink funding program, there are a number of things that suddenly jump out at you. The government is arguing that, because Roads to Recovery was not planned to go beyond this year, it is not in the forward estimates, and therefore it is new money if it goes on into the future. So the government is arguing that that is part of the growth in infrastructure funding. I would dispute that. I would suggest that that is clouding the issue somewhat.</para><para>Another thing that is clouding the issue is in relation to the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme. Most people would remember that the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme was put in place to alleviate the disparity between country and city fuel prices that would have occurred when the 10 per cent GST was imposed. The government, assisted by the National Farmers Federation and others—and the member for Parkes was involved at that time as a farmer representative—quite rightly argued at the time that country people should not be disadvantaged in any way by the imposition of the goods and services tax. The Fuel Sales Grants Scheme was put in place to neutralise the impact, by way of location, of a government tax.</para><para>The government has decided to remove that money. Although it is $270 million a year, it is accounted for in this document as $810 million over three years. That means that country motorists will in a sense be paying for that portion of the $11.8 billion. Country motorists will pay from one cent to 3c a litre more for fuel at the bowser because of the removal of this scheme. Even worse than that, out of the $810 million that country motorists used to receive, there is no guarantee at all that that money will go to country projects. There is no focus in the documents that suggests that country people will be advantaged by that $810 million.</para><para>In the few moments left to me, I will briefly run through some other infrastructure needs that I believe have an impact on the New England and north-west area and should be looked at in terms of future estimates of infrastructure requirements and costings. I spoke earlier of the Murrurundi rail tunnel and the Newcastle port. Bolivia Hill, south of Tenterfield on the New England Highway, has to be one of the major traffic hazards that is left on the national highway. I do congratulate the government for the work that it has been doing on the New England Highway. A lot of good work is being done there, but I do not see Bolivia Hill factored into the AusLink arrangements and I think it should be. There is also the inland rail initiative that I spoke of before. There is currently some examination within the electorate of a transport hub to be based at Glen Innes. If that is seen to be feasible, it may well require the extension of the rail line to be reopened above Armidale through to Queensland, which would be a major initiative for the electorate of New England but it would impact on other areas.</para><para>I would like to spend a moment on the strategic regional projects in the AusLink papers. There has been some adjustment of the total sums of money but, effectively, it is $30 million a year for five years and is there for various councils that may come together and decide they have a worthy regional project that needs greater funding than would flow through the normal Roads to Recovery or other government grant processes. I think it is a good idea, and I encourage the government. I think the Tenterfield Council is coming to this House next week to talk to the minister about the road from Legume to Woodenbong in my electorate. It is on the northern extremity. The Woodenbong point is 128 kilometres from Brisbane, but it has an enormous impact on a number of electorates in southern Queensland, the Darling Downs, the top end of New England and, very importantly, the Lismore and Casino areas on the coast of New South Wales. It is one of those classic cases where funding of this strategic project would advantage a number of councils, two states, and a number of members of parliament from different backgrounds. I would urge the minister to look very closely at that project because it is a very worthy one. </para><para>I spoke briefly a moment ago about the Australian Rail Track Corporation, the $872 million negotiation that took place between the state and the Commonwealth governments last year and the final sign-off. The AusLink documentation seems to suggest that the Commonwealth government is putting $872 million into that arrangement. In fact, it reads that way, but it is not strictly true. The federal government is only putting $150 million in; the New South Wales government, $50 million; and Pacific National, $50 million. The federal government is arranging for debt funding of $620 million. Although I recognise the importance of the agreement, I think the minister should be careful in articulating that there has been $872 million injected at a federal level. That is not the case at all. I am also aware that the ARTC is to manage the remaining lines—the non-Hunter, non-metropolitan lines—in New South Wales. I would like the minister to articulate in his reply what that will mean for some of the smaller lines that will not become part of the national network. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>117</page.no><name role="metadata">Livermore, Kirsten, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LIVERMORE</name><name.id>83A</name.id><electorate>Capricornia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In this debate on the <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> and related legislation there is really no debate at all about the crucial need for investment in land transport infrastructure in this country. Australia's vast size and its dependence on bulk commodity exports means that a safe and efficient land transport network is a central part of maintaining our productivity and our standard of living. In areas like the one that I represent, the condition of our road and rail infrastructure has a direct bearing on everyday life. The road and rail links between the coal and beef producers and their processors and markets are make-or-break for these industries. That is why it is so important for this government to understand the needs and the potential of these industries in regional Australia and to support their growth through strategic investment in relevant infrastructure.</para></talk.start><para>Just as important is the way that the state of roads impacts on the daily lives of people in my electorate and their access to services and opportunities. Whether it is for medical treatment, education or, in the case of many coalminers, the trip back and forth from their homes on the coast to their jobs at the mines, the state of roads is an issue of equity, safety and quality of life. As I said, there is no debate at all about the importance of infrastructure in this country. Rather, the debate on this bill is about how to achieve a strategically planned and integrated land transport network that delivers the best possible returns on the government's infrastructure spending.</para><para>Labor do not believe that AusLink as it is proposed in these bills achieves those aims. That is why we intend to refer the bills to a Senate committee for further investigation and why we have moved the second reading amendment, which calls on the government to maintain funding responsibility for the construction and maintenance of the national highway, to establish a national infrastructure advisory council and to extend the criteria for Roads to Recovery to include public transport, cycling, walking infrastructure and regional airport runways.</para><para>Australia's infrastructure needs have come into sharp focus in recent times, but it is for all the wrong reasons. The government, of course, wants to tell us about the bright new future for infrastructure planning and investment under AusLink, but it still has an awful lot of explaining to do about exactly what it has been doing—or rather not doing—for the last nine years. What has it been doing while capacity constraints have developed at our ports, holding back vital export industries like the booming black coal industry in Central Queensland? What has it been doing while bottlenecks have grown worse on our major rail freight routes? And what has it been doing while funding for the national highway has failed to keep pace with the need for upgrading and maintenance? </para><para>While we are debating these AusLink bills the Australian economy is starting to feel the results of this government's failure to invest wisely and strategically in the important transport infrastructure that our industries need to remain competitive and to make the most of opportunities that are presented by a buoyant world economy. It is not just the opposition that is making these points. Earlier this week the Reserve Bank warned about the risk of increased inflation and rising interest rates as a result of infrastructure constraints and skills shortages. Infrastructure constraints and skills shortages do not materialise overnight, so it is obvious that this government has been asleep at the wheel for the last nine years. It is a government that is happy to cash in on the hard and meaningful reform work that the last Labor government put in place—a government that is happy to take all the credit—but which is too complacent and self-satisfied to face up to the challenges that needed to be addressed in order to maintain the improvements in productivity and competitiveness that Labor achieved in the Australian economy.</para><para>While the government wants to sell its AusLink package as a sign of its commitment to strategic and integrated planning and funding of infrastructure, we in the Labor Party see plenty to be sceptical about based on the government's dismal performance over the past nine years, as evidenced by the pressure points in our economy that were obvious to everyone, it now seems, except the Howard government. The concerns that the Labor Party have about AusLink in its current form are reflected in our second reading amendment. For example, we are concerned that, for all its talk about integrated planning and funding partnerships with the state governments, is AusLink really just an exercise in cost-shifting and stepping back from the Commonwealth government's responsibility in the area of land transport? That certainly seems to be the case when it comes to funding for the national highway.</para><para>AusLink requires the federal government to determine a national land transport network consisting of nationally significant road and rail links, but it does not identify the national highway, nor does it specify federal government responsibility for construction and maintenance of the national highway network. So where is the certainty for the people of Central Queensland—who rely on the Bruce Highway as a lifeline to Brisbane for so many business and personal needs—that funding will be there for its maintenance and upgrading as population pressures increase traffic on that road? Instead of the Commonwealth accepting its responsibility for that vital piece of national infrastructure, it has now capped its contribution to maintenance of the national highway at $300 million per annum for the five-year life of the current AusLink agreement. The maintenance shortfall, which can only get bigger, especially in a fast-growing state like Queensland, is left for the state government to pick up.</para><para>Labor's election commitment to fully fund the national highway would provide much more certainty to the people of my electorate that the Bruce Highway would receive the attention it deserves as the major transport link along the Queensland coast. We are also concerned that this package builds in the same flaws and opportunities for pork-barrelling that we have seen demonstrated in the Regional Partnerships program. Funding for projects in key elements of the AusLink package—the AusLink strategic regional projects funding and a proportion of the Roads to Recovery funding—are left to the minister's discretion. Where have we heard that one before? Just a couple of hours ago in question time and in the censure motion debate. Prior to the last election $93 million of strategic regional projects money was already committed, and you can bet that the minister will be busy exercising his discretion in favour of his National Party mates in key seats in the lead-up to the next election. </para><para>Labor take the infrastructure needs of this country much more seriously. We actually believe that when it comes to investing millions, if not billions, of dollars in infrastructure it is the national interest, rather than narrow self-serving political interests, that should prevail. That is why Labor have taken the proposal for a national infrastructure advisory council to the last two elections. When it comes to building a strategic and integrated transport network in Australia we want decisions to be based on the best possible independent advice, free from political interests. Our plan for an advisory council would see infrastructure investments guided by objective advice from industry, consumer and expert representatives based on transparent social, economic and environmental criteria.</para><para>Given the way that the funding for the Regional Partnerships program was distributed, the people of my electorate of Capricornia are well entitled to ask whether the Howard government can be trusted to distribute the funding for AusLink equitably across all of Australia. Across the local government areas of Central Queensland there are 146 roads which have been identified as roads of regional significance by the Central Queensland Regional Road Group. The people of Central Queensland would like to be assured that these roads, which local councils have determined hold the key to future development in Central Queensland, will be given the necessary priority to ensure that they are upgraded to a standard which will support the opportunities we are creating in the mining, agriculture, defence and tourism industries.</para><para>In the Livingstone shire alone, 39 roads have been identified as vital to tourist development on the Capricorn Coast, as well as the much needed improvement of the access roads to the Shoalwater Bay defence training area. I particularly wish to dwell for a moment on these access roads to Shoalwater Bay. I am sure that all in this House are aware of the importance of this facility to our defence forces and our allies who use the Shoalwater Bay training area. We on this side of the House believe that the access roads to Shoalwater Bay are not only roads of regional significance but, in fact, roads of national significance, due to the critical role that Shoalwater Bay plays in our national defence capability. This is why prior to the last election we committed an Australian Labor government to spending the $15 million necessary to ensure adequate access to the military training area.</para><para>The Shoalwater Bay training area is widely recognised as one of the best military training facilities in the world. This facility is the only area in Australia where the Army, Air Force and Navy are able to engage in joint military exercises. This area is used extensively by Australian forces and those of our allies the United States and Singapore. Training exercises and joint manoeuvres are held at Shoalwater Bay regularly. </para><para>The Shoalwater Bay training area is serviced by four road routes. These are the Stanage Bay Road, better known as the grey route; Raspberry Creek Road, better known as the green route; Rossmoya and Canal Creek roads, better known as the brown route; and Farnborough and Byfield roads, better known as the blue route. It is worth noting that the blue route is a Queensland Department of Main Roads road and is sealed up to Byfield. So one could argue that the Queensland government has done its bit for national security and it is now up to the Howard Government to do its bit by attending to the other three entrance roads to this vital training facility.</para><para>Whilst it is true that the Department of Defence does provide some `make good' funding to the Livingstone Shire Council to assist with road repairs to Shoalwater Bay, undertaking the proposed upgrading works will result in long-term savings of approximately one-third of the annual maintenance cost of the existing gravel roads. This is particularly important with the prospect now of an expansion of military exercises in Shoalwater Bay following last year's signing by the government of a joint training agreement with the United States.</para><para>It is expected that by 2007 the Central Queensland region will be hosting as many as 10,000 US soldiers. It is not good enough for the Howard government to commit our country to such an undertaking without due consideration to the added demands it will place on the infrastructure in Central Queensland. Patch-up money for maintenance of these rural roads will simply not keep up with the demands placed on these roads, and it should not be the ratepayers of Livingstone shire who foot the bill.</para><para>As well as the Queensland government, the whole of the Central Queensland region has invested heavily in infrastructure to support and profit from Defence Force use of the Shoalwater Bay training area. Further infrastructure and development is required to keep Shoalwater Bay training area as a preferred training venue, with the resulting benefits to our regional economy. It is estimated that Defence Force exercises at Shoalwater Bay training area inject $10 million into the regional economy every year. This figure is significantly more every second year, when joint exercises with the US defence forces are conducted. In addition, there are significant multiplier effects to the wider economy of Central Queensland, including an estimated $7 million expended through military tourism in the region every year.</para><para>The people of Central Queensland ask the government to pick up the commitment made by the Australian Labor Party and fund these roads of national defence importance. We ask the government to seal the remaining gravel sections of the Rossmoya Road, Canal Creek Road, the Raspberry Creek Road and Stanage Bay Road to the entrance of the Shoalwater Bay training area. Members of this House may recall, as do the people of Central Queensland, that it was only after the commitment I and the Australian Labor Party made prior to the 1998 federal election to upgrade the runway at Rockhampton Airport that the Howard government finally provided the money to enable the use of Rockhampton Airport by jumbo jets. That was necessary for the continued development and use of the defence training facilities at Shoalwater Bay, and so too is the sealing of the access roads to the Shoalwater Bay training area.</para><para>It is not just in the area of supporting the defence industry and defence activity in Central Queensland that we need assistance from the federal government. As anyone reading the paper over the last couple of weeks would know, the coal industry is also crying out for immediate investment in infrastructure to support that industry. This is necessary for the prosperity of not only Central Queensland, which is the biggest coalmining area in Australia, but also the whole of our national economy. </para><para>That brings me to another important transport project in my electorate, the so-called missing link that would open up access between the whole of the northern Bowen Basin coalmining region and the Abbot Point coal-loading facility at Bowen in North Queensland. Construction of 70 kilometres of railway line would link the Newlands-Abbot Point line with the Goonyella-Moranbah line, providing an integrated transport link between the Bowen Basin coal industry and the port of Abbot Point. With an estimated construction cost of $72.2 million, it was determined by a Queensland Rail feasibility study in 1993 that sufficient benefit could be generated to justify investment in the rail link. There is no question, 12 years on from that feasibility study, that the time has come for the federal government to look very closely at this project, which would solve many of the problems facing the coal industry right now.</para><para>As I said, we have seen stories in the paper day after day this week on the capacity constraints that are becoming very obvious at the coal-loading facilities in Newcastle and, closer to my home in Central Queensland, at the coal-loading facilities of Hay Point and Dalrymple Bay. Coal production is booming in the Bowen Basin and there is huge demand for Australian black coal. The advantages of building this rail link between the Newlands-Abbot Point line and the Goonyella-Moranbah line are that it would open up the Bowen Basin to Abbot Point and that it would create an alternative coal export facility to those at Dalrymple Bay and Hay Point, which are constrained not only by their capacity constraints but also by weather. Abbot Point is much more reliable throughout the year and is not as affected by the weather as Dalrymple Bay and Hay Point are. There is capacity in the current design of Abbot Point to double the size of the Abbot Point coal-loading facility, and I am told by the Bowen Collinsville Enterprise organisation that that could be done at a much lower cost than an equivalent expansion at either Hay Point or Dalrymple Bay.</para><para>The constraints on export capacity are really holding back activity in the coal industry at the moment. It is crazy for the government to overlook this relatively minor infrastructure project—just 70 kilometres of rail line that could greatly expand the coal exporting capacity of Central Queensland. The Bowen Collinsville Enterprise organisation has, in conjunction with the Bowen Shire Council, done an awful lot of homework on this project, as has Queensland Rail. I think it is very much the time, when we hear about the constraints on our coal exporting capacity every day, to look closely at this project under the strategic regional projects element of AusLink, to see what can be done to support this project so as to open up not just the coal industry but also possibilities for other bulk commodities that could be shipped out through Abbott Point. The project would be of enormous benefit to the town of Bowen, which has done it tough in the last few years, and also to its neighbouring town of Collinsville, which is an important coalmining centre some 80 kilometres south-west of Bowen.</para><para>In conclusion I want to urge the government to take seriously the approach that the Labor Party has taken to this bill. We are not blocking the bill in any sense. We have moved the second reading amendment in very good faith, putting forward ideas that we have come up with for important infrastructure development in this country, proposing a way forward to make sure that infrastructure investment is done in a way that is not partisan in any way and is coherent and strategic—ensuring that it is not done to favour one interest over another. Our proposals for a national infrastructure advisory council are all about taking the politics out of infrastructure spending and I think that is very worthy and something that the government should look at very closely. Our other proviso on supporting this bill is to subject the measures to a Senate inquiry. That is also done in a very constructive spirit, because we realise at the moment that we have had too little focus on infrastructure spending in this country and that is now really creating bottlenecks that can jeopardise our economic prosperity into the future. We are supporting the bill, but I call on the government not only to look closely at the projects that I have highlighted in my electorate but also to consider carefully the recommendations that come out of the Senate inquiry, because the inquiry will be carried out in the national interest. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>122</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2237">AusLink (National Land Transport—Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004</inline> have the capacity to impact on the future prosperity of Australia. This can be seen from the contributions made by speakers on both sides of the House. From an economic point of view no issues are more important than those covered in this legislation. This package of bills provides for an integrated network of road and rail transport linkages of national importance and includes funding provisions for programs under a new national land transport network, black spot projects, a new discretionary fund for strategic regional projects and continuing projects under the Roads to Recovery program. In making my contribution to the parliament, I will talk about a number of those.</para></talk.start><para>It is imperative that Australia has the best, most effective and efficient transport system available. To achieve this it must embrace all forms of transport and of infrastructure supporting our transport systems: rail, road, sea, public transport, airport runways, cycleways and walkways. Some of those are not covered in this legislation. One of the glaring omissions from this legislation is any mention whatsoever of shipping and port infrastructure, because that infrastructure is vital for our nation. I find this most disturbing. After all, Australia is an island nation and shipping and our ports are vital to our future. I support the linkage of road and rail, but I believe it would enhance our transport system if the issues surrounding shipping—such as our ports—were also covered by this legislation.</para><para>I commence my contribution to this debate by highlighting the importance of our national transport system or network. Unfortunately, I believe the government has been negligent and has ignored the best options—the best practice—on the grounds of opting once again for a political approach and grubby politics. I do not believe that when it comes to something as vital as this we should be indulging ourselves in grubby politics. I come to this place having looked at roads from three different levels of government. I have been fortunate enough to be a representative at local government level, state level and now federal level. At each of those levels the issues surrounding roads and road infrastructure are amongst the most important issues.</para><para>Back in 2001-02, I conducted a survey of my electorate. I presented the constituents of Shortland with a list of items and asked them to rank them from the most important to the least important. Of all the items that people were presented with roads came out on top as an issue. The road infrastructure within their area was highlighted by 96 per cent of people as being of great importance. This legislation covers a number of areas, and I will spend some time going through them. </para><para>The purpose of this AusLink legislation is to limit the operation of the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 and to remove the ALTD special account. This requires that a national land transport network consisting of nationally significant roads and rail links be determined. This is fundamentally different from existing arrangements as it does not identify the national highway network, which has been an underlying principle in all previous legislation. I find that of great concern. It does not specify federal government responsibility for the construction and maintenance of our national highway network either. I know that many speakers on this side of the House have already highlighted that fact, and we have highlighted it because we see this as the Commonwealth moving away from one of its core responsibilities. The Commonwealth has always had responsibility for our national highways.</para><para>In this legislation, I see the government inching away from its responsibilities. One of the things that always concerns me, no matter what area I am looking at, is the tension between the Commonwealth, state and local government. Each level of government often tries to shift its areas of responsibility to the other. I do not think that is the best solution for the Australian people. I think the best solution is for the federal government to show leadership, and for all levels of government to work together, rather than having a situation where one level of government is seeking to abrogate its responsibilities. I fear that, by not identifying the national highway network and by moving away from its responsibilities for the construction and maintenance of the national highway, the Commonwealth is abrogating its responsibilities. The bill sets out eligibility criteria for different categories of assistance and the matters which may be considered in deciding whether a project or activities are to be approved or funded. It provides conditions for funding. Under the existing arrangements, state and federal governments identify the priorities for federal funding and provide project management. This will change under this legislation.</para><para>One of the things that really concerns me is the discretionary power that the minister will have under this legislation. I know I speak for my colleagues on this side of the House when I say that we believe in accountability and openness. I do not think you can achieve those things where there is a high level of discretionary power. The minister decides how to allocate funds for projects under AusLink strategic regional projects. I fear that can lead to pork-barrelling and the establishment of another National Party slush fund—another fund to re-elect the Howard government.</para><para>The Australian people deserve better than that. The Australian people deserve a government that makes its decisions openly and does not rely on discretionary power. Earlier today we were talking about the Regional Partnerships program. The thing that worries me about that program is that the area consultative committee can make a recommendation and then that recommendation can be overridden by the minister. I do not believe that is good government. I do not believe that is best practice in government. I find it particularly disturbing that one of the projects that has been discussed is Tumbi Creek, which is in the Wyong Shire Council area, which is also included in the Shortland electorate.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Baldwin)</inline>—Order!

But don't be too sensitive about it, because I am actually talking about discretionary powers—how discretionary powers work currently and how they will work under this legislation. I feel that, where there are examples of discretionary powers not working properly, it behoves me, as a member of this House, to highlight that fact in the parliament.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The process that was adopted in the development of this legislation was as follows. There was a green paper on 7 January 2002 and, once that green paper was tabled, it was open for comment until 7 February 2003. There were 550 written submissions, from government, industry and the community. The white paper was released in June 2004. The green paper that had a joint working group on AusLink priorities on the national network was established to assist in the development of a possible set of national infrastructure priorities for the initial five years. However, the thing that concerns me is that state and territory governments have complained that there was little or no consultation in developing the national priorities for the first five years of the AusLink national land transport plan. This is of great concern because, as I highlighted earlier, the best results are achieved by governments at all levels working together.</para><para>I would like to briefly turn to the white paper. In doing so, I wish to highlight that all the right words are used. The executive summary says:</para><quote><para>The Australian Government is embarking on a far-reaching transformation of the way Australia plans, funds and delivers land transport infrastructure.</para></quote><para>Planning is good. The words used in this executive summary are good, but what about the details that underline this? The executive summary continues:</para><quote><para>Under AusLink, the Australian Government takes a strategic approach to Australia's future ...</para></quote><para>A strategic approach is the approach that needs to be taken. The document goes on to say that it does this `by ensuring that the nation's land transport network meets future challenges'. But I really do not think that this legislation does that, and that is the sad part of it. It is a missed opportunity. The government had the opportunity to do that, to ensure the development of the type of modern infrastructure that would take Australia into the next century, that would ensure sustainable economic growth, and I believe it has failed. It has failed to a large extent by slipping into the mire of partisan politics yet again, just as it did with the Regional Partnerships program.</para><para>I would now like to highlight some of the issues that I see as important and some of the areas where I think the government has failed. I have highlighted the discretionary power of the minister. I do not like that. As I pointed out, that has been well established. You have seen the flaws in that today here in the House, particularly with reference to Tumbi Creek. The Commonwealth is also abrogating its responsibility—the cost sharing with the states for the maintenance of the highway. I feel that that is extremely flawed and a very bad step by the government. I think the government really needs to revisit that.</para><para>The Labor Party, as the member for Capricornia pointed out so admirably in her contribution to the parliament, has gone to the last two elections with a proposal for a national infrastructure council. That would get around some of the problems that I have with this legislation. It would be an open and accountable way to look at developing the priorities that are in the nation's interests. It would be a way to ensure that those statements that I read out from the white paper—about our need to plan and deliver the funds in the appropriate way—actually get put into practice so that we do get a land transport network that meets the future needs of Australia. We need this to happen without political interference. </para><para>We do not need any more National Party slush funds, we do not need any more re-elect Howard slush funds; we need good quality infrastructure. We need investment in the development of this infrastructure and we need that to be determined on a needs basis and in a way that will ensure that Australia has the best infrastructure—infrastructure that meets the needs of our nation. We need a cooperative approach that includes all levels of government, the community and business. I do not think that that can happen under this legislation. I did refer to the flaws in that process in relation to the first five-year AusLink national land transport plan and the fact that the states and territories were not happy with the consultation in relation to that and their ability to have input into that. We need quality infrastructure. We need this to work for the future of Australia. We need it for economic growth and sustainable regional communities. Unless we have the right sort of infrastructure and the right sort of transport system, that will never happen.</para><para>As I have already highlighted a number of times, we do not want any more National Party slush funds. We do not want any more pork-barrelling. We do not want a new Regional Partnerships program. We do not want any more partisan decisions: the kinds of decisions that have happened with the National Trust program or with the Roads of National Importance—or with Networking the Nation, in the communication area. We want that to stop. We want decisions made on merit. We want our infrastructure to be invested in and developed in the interests of the nation, not in the interests of partisan politics. That approach is not in Australia's interests. Parochial politics do not lead to a sustainable economic future. It is time the government moved away from that approach and developed an approach that is for all Australians and in Australia's interests.</para><para>Governments have choices. This government can choose to govern for all Australians and in the best interests of our nation or it can choose to adopt a small-minded partisan political approach: I fear that this legislation has the potential to allow the government to again make the second choice. We need quality infrastructure. We need infrastructure for the future—to ensure a strong future. We do not want to end up as a second-rate nation.

That is a very good thing. The plan outlined in the bill is the culmination, we are told, of three years of consultation and development and allocates some $11.8 billion in federal funding over five years for both road and rail and for an integrated land transport network. The government has identified a doubling in non-bulk freight, a doubling in interstate road freight and a 40 per cent increase in passenger travel to 2020.</para><para>I am happy to see the additional $872 million to be invested in the Australian Rail Track Corporation for the eastern seaboard north-south rail links over the next five years. I remember evidence given to the `Time running out' inquiry that I was a member of a couple of years back. That was an inquiry of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services. If I remember correctly, Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin, you may have been a part of that. Time after time, there was evidence of the parlous state of our rail network. I seem to remember a story about our main Brisbane-Sydney line where the guard had to reach out and manually trigger the signals at certain points along that link. This was in 1999-2000. The network has been Third World standard in many respects, and anything that can be done to bring that link alone up to world-class standard must be welcome. We must strike a balance between rail and road in this country and allow rail to catch up. It is way, way behind. I believe that this national land transport bill goes a long way towards improving that critical state of our rail network.</para><para>I want to concentrate my remarks on the aspects of the plan supporting local and regional infrastructure. In January last year, the minister announced the continuation of the Roads to Recovery program, which was due to expire at the end of financial year 2005. The 2004-05 budget provided for the allocation of another $1.2 billion to the program over four years. That consisted of $200 million per year to be allocated under the Roads to Recovery formula to fund local roads and $100 million allocated on a competitive basis for projects of economic and social significance.</para><para>The AusLink white paper released in June last year split this funding into two streams, providing $400 million for Strategic Regional Projects and $800 million for the AusLink Roads to Recovery program. During the election campaign, the coalition announced that it would top up funding available to councils under the Roads to Recovery formula to its original $1.2 billion over four years. Councils quite rightly saw the white paper's two-stream formula as cutting their guaranteed allocations by a third. This has been corrected. In the same policy document, `Building our national transport future', the coalition undertook to provide Strategic Regional Projects funding of $120 million over the same period. I am not quite sure whether this money replaces the $400 million allocated to the strategic regional projects in the white paper or whether it is in addition to it. I hope that the minister or his advisers might be able to clarify this situation.</para><para>Roads to Recovery has been an extremely important program for councils in my electorate, providing councils with much-needed extra road funding since its introduction four years ago. What is more, unlike other programs which have had a good airing in recent days, it has been allocated by an independent process, through the Grants Commission, according to a clear formula. It has enabled the replacement of old and dangerous bridges, the upgrading of intersections and the widening of narrow country roads. The number of signs around my electorate, and no doubt others, is testament to the worth of the projects to which that money has been put. </para><para>But there are figures that show that we are only beginning to catch up with the slow decline in infrastructure spending in this country over the last 20 years, particularly in roads since 1990. The figures in the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> quite clearly display the fact that in real terms—and I know the GST has become available to the states in that period—Commonwealth funding has slipped from $1,597.3 million in 1993-94 dollars in the 1990-91 year to $1,358.2 million in 2002-03.</para><para>It can be rightly said that, while very welcome and necessary, the Roads to Recovery program has but helped catch up, to a degree, with the clear falling away in funding over that decade and longer. It is welcome, and this national AusLink program will go further towards redressing that fall off in national infrastructure spending over the last two decades. The AusLink strategic regional project is designed to support local transport projects of regional, economic and social significance, as described in the white paper. In brief, the idea is to target local transport links that are significant to major transport corridors that are part of the national network that form an important part of the economic development strategies within a region, provide access to export related transport networks and enhance access for regional communities to services and employment.</para><para>I would hope this includes a serious examination of transport links from western New South Wales to the ports of Newcastle and Wollongong so that we do not put all our planning energy into the Sydney corridor, of which I will say a little bit more in a moment. There is a lot of evidence coming from and supported by gentlemen such as Professor John Chudleigh, who has had a lot of input into the government's regional strategies over the years. He and others are very concerned that we are thinking in terms of east-west development, particularly in New South Wales, and we are not looking enough at our north-south links, particularly in the tableland area just west of the Great Divide. There are links, such as that through Canberra, Goulburn, Bathurst and north to Mudgee, that have been improved significantly in recent years with Roads to Recovery and black spot funding. It is a bit like the Telstra network—it is a super highway in parts, a reasonable highway in parts and virtually a dirt track in others. It needs to be linked up into one major link so that we can deflect a lot of transport pressure from the Blue Mountains corridor to the ports of Newcastle and Wollongong. I note an earlier contribution—I think it was from the member for Hunter—which said that we must also be looking at integrating our transport and infrastructure strategies to include our port infrastructure.</para><para>That brings me to the national infrastructure report that was done by a parliamentary committee and delivered in February 2000. There were a couple of key recommendations. I believe the most important one in fact was recommendation 6:</para><quote><para>... that the Commonwealth Government establish a National Infrastructure Advisory Council with expertise from the public and the private sectors, to facilitate the efficient and equitable provision of national infrastructure by both public and private sector stakeholders. </para></quote><para>Many recommendations in that report referred to the need for the national infrastructure council to be set up as an advisory council to report, through the Council of Australian Governments, to ministers responsible for regional development on strategic infrastructure—where it is taking place and what the needs are—and looking forward 10, 20 and 30 years rather than succumbing to the temptation to look only at the electoral cycle. The AusLink program is the beginning of that sort of structure, but it lacks the vision that this report recommended following the input of Fred Argy and others, along with councils all over Australia, infrastructure experts and tax experts looking at the potential for superannuation funds to become involved in national infrastructure and so on. There is an element of that structure in the rail portion of this AusLink program, and I know the minister said that he did not want to have another advisory group involved in the process. But I and the committee, made up of members of this House from right across the political spectrum, saw enough evidence to suggest strongly that it should be a prime consideration in any transport policy in this country.</para><para>As others have said, there is far too much discretionary spending in this particular bill. There are real concerns in my mind about some of the approval of projects processes built into the bill. I notice under division 1, approval of projects, it is commented by those researching this bill that the minister's determination is not required to be tabled in each house of parliament and is not subject to disallowance. That may or may not attract the interest of the minister, but I would like him, if he would, to explain exactly why that process is in place. There is a comment at the end of the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> that details of projects approved under the national plan are not required to be tabled or published, with the exception of the Roads to Recovery program. Given that there is a large discretionary fund for competitive tendering, it does suggest that there could be a temptation—not necessarily with this minister or government but in years ahead—for any minister in a tight election process to use a discretion that is not in the best interests of regional or national infrastructure priorities and wise spending of scarce public moneys.</para><para>I would like to comment on a couple of the contributions that councils in my area made to the AusLink green paper. The Central West Regional Organisation of Councils, CENTROC, said amongst other things in its submission:</para><quote><para>It has long been recognised that transport will play an increasing part in the area's development.</para></quote><para>CENTROC stretches from Condobolin to Wellington, Forbes, Cowra and all the councils in between to the Blue Mountains. The submission continued:</para><quote><para>Intermodal points are now established at Blayney and Parkes and others are planned. Road conditions, as mentioned elsewhere in this submission, impeded the realisation of the area's potential. All of the local government areas in CENTROC have an umbilical cord to Sydney via the Great Western Highway and this road is the dominant form of transport and clearly needs the most focus.</para></quote><para>While the Dubbo-Sydney link is on the AusLink program, there seems to me to be a strong need to look at those links to the ports of Newcastle and Wollongong and to also see a greater commitment to the Mid Western Highway and those other links between Bathurst, Cowra, Parkes and the Blue Mountains.</para><para>In recent days a draft of the Blue Mountains highway proposal has been released. This is being conducted by consultants for a tri-government Blue Mountains access group, which is headed by the Hon. Ian Armstrong and includes members of all political parties, state and federal; Independents; and party representatives west of the Blue Mountains. It has detailed a four-lane divided highway which would commence south of Windsor and approximate the Bells Line of Road up to the Newnes Plateau then follow the plateau north of Lithgow and intersect with the Great Western Highway at the Mudgee turn-off. </para><para>Members may remember some suggestions that were pilloried by the state Labor government where tunnels under the mountains were suggested. There have been any number of suggestions of how this can be done and how the sand derived from those tunnels from the sandstone curtain could be used for Sydney's building boom in the years ahead. I think the money involved in such a project would absolutely preclude its completion on a cost-benefit ratio at this point. However, we now have—it will not be released in detail for another six weeks or so—an engineering and economic report that suggests that an above topography route, which is 94 kilometres in length, is feasible. It will run into some quite significant opposition through the fact that six kilometres of it will touch on the declared wilderness area of the Blue Mountains National Park. That is going to be a major hurdle, no doubt.</para><para>I put it to the House that unless there is a `decoagulation', if you like—it is the only word I can think of—of that link across the Blue Mountains, we are going to get gridlock within 10, 15 or 20 years. The central west of New South Wales, and all of those arteries leading into that route across the mountains, carry goods that contribute enormously to the production and the wealth of this country. We must find a route across those mountains that is better than the existing Great Western Highway.</para><para>The government assisted by declaring the Great Western Highway a road of national importance in the late nineties and I think they contributed something in the order of $100 million to help develop that improved access. But the more that route is being improved, the more it is resembling a glorified Pennant Hills road. I have travelled it several times recently. While there is an enormous amount of work being done, it strikes me that with its variation of speed limits—50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 kilometres per hour—it is never going to represent the sort of national highway link that will be required in the years ahead. That begs the question: why don't we look more at the Bells Line of Road option to see if we cannot reach some sort of compromise? The suggested route, as I understand it, goes behind the heritage villages of the Bilpin area. I think it is very much worth investigating. If it gets approval—and there is enormous support for it—then it should become part of the AusLink program and attract significant federal support, as should the upgrading of the rail linkages not only into Sydney but into those ports of Newcastle and Wollongong, as I have suggested.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>129</page.no><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LLOYD</name><name.id>IK6</name.id><electorate>Robertson</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I take this opportunity to thank all honourable members for their contribution to this debate. Today is a very significant day in this parliament, where we will see the passing of the <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2237">AusLink (National Land Transport—Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004</inline> through this House.</para></talk.start><para>These bills represent major reform legislation. They herald the most important change to national land transport policy in the past 30 years. The AusLink program has a generational commitment to transport infrastructure improvement. It will help deliver on the government's vision for a land transport system that can both meet the challenges of the transport task and make its contribution to a stronger economy. Since coming to office, the Australian government has already taken major steps towards positioning Australia to sustain long-term economic growth. It has significantly reduced public debt by some $70 billion and fundamentally restructured the tax system. High performing land transport infrastructure is a further prerequisite to ongoing improvements in our national productivity and competitiveness as our population ages over the next 20 to 30 years. </para><para>The AusLink initiative introduces a new, modern and innovative approach to land transport infrastructure planning, decision making and funding. It backs these reforms with a massive increase in funding which our sound economic stewardship has enabled us to provide. The overwhelming bulk of the AusLink investment—over $8 billion over the next five years—will be directed to the new land transport network. The new AusLink national network brings together for the very first time previously separated planned and funded road and rail networks into a single, integrated network which will be an essential foundation for a fully effective national transport system.</para><para>The government is providing the platform for the revitalisation of the national rail network. Without an effective interstate rail freight system, Australia's transport system cannot work. For the first time, the Australian government's transport infrastructure funding will be guided and underpinned by an announced five-year national plan. The five-year plan focuses on the highest priority projects that provide economic and social benefits from a national perspective. Importantly, we are also providing a five-year funding commitment which gives certainty to state and local governments, and to transport and construction industries. This is unprecedented and provides for certainty of investment.</para><para>AusLink provides the framework for a planned national system whereby all levels of government will be working to deliver the best transport investment. The Australian government has set out a clear strategic direction which governs the priorities it has established for the next five years. In brief, these priorities are: establishing long-term and integrated planning; improving the eastern seaboard's north-south corridors; improving interstate and interregional corridors; addressing urban congestion on key freight links; utilising technology where it can enhance and improve efficiency, safety and security on the national network; improving safety and security overall; protecting the Australian government's past investment in major links; and supporting regional and local economic growth. At the project level, the program provides for substantial investment in Australia's most important land transport links, including the F3 and Pacific Highway, the Hume Highway, the Sydney to Brisbane and Sydney to Melbourne interstate railways, and the Bruce and Calder highways.</para><para>The program enables many critical projects to be undertaken—the Geelong bypass, the Peel deviation in Western Australia, the Port River expressway in South Australia and the Bridgewater Bridge in Tasmania are just a few examples. It is absurd to suggest that investment in such projects will not yield major economic benefits at both the national and local level. This will be the first time that a national government will be putting in place arrangements that look beyond the current five-year program through a development of long-term corridor strategies developed against a 20-year time horizon. Corridor strategies will provide the basis for identifying shared government priorities and provide non-government stakeholders with the opportunity to contribute to the longer term planning and funding of national land transport infrastructure in Australia. </para><para>Corridor strategies will be supported by a range of rigorous studies to determine corridor needs, deficiencies and future priorities. They will focus on identifying the best solution to the transport needs of each corridor, irrespective of the transport mode. Industry and stakeholder consultation will be a critical source of information. Work on developing corridor strategies in conjunction with the state and territory governments will commence in earnest this year. Initially we will focus on a small number of pilot studies and expand into larger groups as we gain experience.</para><para>There will be a nationally consistent project assessment methodology to inform the development of corridor strategies and the assessment of future project priorities. This methodology has been developed in conjunction with the states, territories and local government and has now also been agreed to by Australian Transport Council ministers. This is a key reform. The government has set up the framework for evidence based national investment. AusLink is about ensuring the nation invests in its best projects.</para><para>The opposition has made a number of proposals in its second reading amendment. The first relates to the discontinuation of the national highway system. The opposition amendment is critical of the discontinuation of the 30-year-old national highway system funding arrangement. The bill provides for the government to move beyond the single mode-focused national highway system to a broader and integrated network of nationally important road and rail links. A number of opposition members made comments during the debate which were also supportive of moving on from the old national highway system to a concept of a single, integrated network.</para><para>Under the announced AusLink program, all states and the Northern Territory will receive large increases in funding for construction projects on the national network. It is therefore quite ridiculous to suggest that the Australian government is somehow avoiding its funding responsibilities. The AusLink shared funding arrangements recognise that many projects on the national network as well as having substantial national benefits will also have benefits that are more local in nature. In these cases, funding contributions at both the national and state level are appropriate. The AusLink shared funding arrangements also recognise that the national network now includes links that previously had been totally or partly the responsibility of the states to fund—links that the Australian government previously had no responsibility for. At the same time, the Australian government is continuing to fully fund many projects on the former national highway system, particular those in rural and remote areas. The opposition's position is now an outdated approach to transport funding and, accordingly, the government does not support it.</para><para>The second part of the opposition amendment proposes the establishment of an independent national infrastructure advisory council. Whilst the government's AusLink white paper lays considerable stress on the importance of long-term planning for national land transport infrastructure, it cannot support the opposition's approach. Labor's proposal, which is lacking in any firm detail, is to set up another bureaucratic talkfest that will not provide effective advice on national priorities. Our view is that such advice is unnecessary at this stage, given that the national land transport network is premised on infrastructure investment priorities identified by the state governments. An example is the Pacific and Hume highways. Indeed, our priorities were reached following quite detailed consultation and advice from departments at the state government level. These governments will continue to work closely with us to establish corridor needs and priorities on the national network. </para><para>The AusLink white paper does moot in the future the establishment of a National Transport Advisory Council. The Australian Transport Council, comprising Australian, state and territory government representation, has already agreed to further consider the establishment of the National Transport Advisory Council in the future. If the council decides to establish such a body, it will provide strategic analysis and advice on long-term planning for the national transport system involving all stakeholders, including the private sector.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition is completely wrong in his claims that AusLink is promoting tension between the Australian government and the states and territories. AusLink is intended to promote a cooperative approach between all levels of government in Australia for long-term transport infrastructure planning and implementation. The process that is already underway to establish agreed priorities on the national network is clear evidence of that. As a government, we will not abrogate our responsibilities to take decisions in the nation's best interests. We are setting priorities and making the investment. We work cooperatively with the states, territories and local governments, but we will not agree to Labor's amendment.</para><para>The third part of that second reading amendment is the broadening of the Roads to Recovery funding purpose. The AusLink bill also demonstrates the Australian government's continuing commitment to local communities through extending the very successful Roads to Recovery program beyond its initial time frame of 2005, a program that I recall the Leader of the Opposition called a `boondoggle' when it was first introduced, but it has been one of the government's greatest programs and well received, particularly with local councils throughout Australia.</para><para>I was also pleased to hear that many opposition members are convinced of the worth of this program, which has been, as I said earlier, of enormous benefit to local councils throughout Australia. Local councils know that it is a good thing, and opposition members also know that it is a good thing. In 2004-05 some $253 million is being provided for local roads in the final year of the current four-year Roads to Recovery program. By the end of this current program, some 12,000 local road projects will have been funded. In the four years from 2005-06, and 2008-09, a further $1.2 billion will be provided to local councillors on the basis of a similar funding formula arrangement that has applied under the current Roads to Recovery program.</para><para>That sends a very strong signal that this government is determined to continue to help achieve a vibrant economy and social outcomes for local communities. Councils will continue to have wide discretion in determining the projects to which their formula based applications are applied. The key condition is simply that it be spent on the construction and maintenance of roads. The government's firm view is that the planning and funding of public transport services is a state and, in some cases, local responsibility. That said, it is open to local councils to apply funding to road construction projects which might assist, for example, the efficient and safe operation of road based public transport. Honourable members might also like to note that the definition of a road in this bill already includes a path for the use of persons riding bicycles. We do not propose to extend the criteria beyond those for which we have currently provided.</para><para>Early passage of this legislation will enable local governments across Australia to be given certainty about the future of funding and the conditions applying to this important stream of funding to improve and maintain local roads. I urge the opposition to enable this legislation to pass not only through this House but through the Senate as quickly as possible so that this important program can again be funded for local councils. </para><para>In addition to the $1.453 billion, which will be distributed to councils on a formula basis, $150 million will be provided over the five years from 2004-05 to 2008-09 for local road projects of strategic regional importance. This will include funding for local roads in unincorporated areas. I emphasise that this is additional money. This is new money which is important to local councils. This funding for local roads under the Roads to Recovery money is in addition to the $2.55 billion over the next five years that will be provided to local councils as untied local road grants.</para><para>The government is concerned to see not only effective planning in investment decision making but also efficient project delivery arrangements. The application of the national construction code and implementation guidelines is a key part of the government's drive to improve the efficiency of the construction industry and eliminate uncompetitive practices. It is therefore an important element of the AusLink five-year funding agreements currently being negotiated with the states. I am delighted that the Victorian government has agreed to apply unchanged the national construction code to AusLink projects in Victoria.</para><para>Consistent with the government's longstanding undertaking to consult with the states and territories on any proposed changes to the code, the government will consult with the Victorian government on possible future changes to the code and implementation guidelines. A formal agreement is yet to be finalised where, for the purposes of the code, AusLink funding to Victoria would be considered as one project. Agreement to the code paves the way to settle the bilateral AusLink five-year funding agreement with Victoria. This development follows agreements being reached between the Australian and South Australian governments on joint implementation guidelines that will apply to major AusLink projects in South Australia. I strongly encourage the remaining states and territories to now follow South Australia and Victoria's lead.</para><para>In conclusion, I reinforce that the arrangements to be established by these bills will drive the development of our key road and rail links and ensure that they are forged into one single high performing and safe national network. They will move beyond the entrenched arrangements for separate road and rail funding which hampered rail development, recognise the critical importance of our links to our ports and airports in supporting a globally competitive transport system, and drive the upgrading of local road networks and the development of key regional links. The Howard government is investing in Australia's future. These bills will provide for the planning and evidence based investment decision-making framework which Australia needs. The government will also provide unprecedented levels of funding for our national road and rail infrastructure. I commend both of these bills to the House.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

<inline ref="R2173">Australian Communications and Media Authority Bill 2004</inline> and related bills and to respond on behalf of the opposition. I do so in my representative capacity, representing in this chamber the shadow minister for communications, Senator Conroy, who of course is in the other place. Labor supports this legislation as a necessary first step in addressing the increasing regulatory problems posed by the emergence of convergent technologies. It is a step towards addressing this issue—a much delayed one at that, but in the final analysis it is a step in the right direction.</para></talk.start><para>Convergence is the process whereby digitisation and other technological innovations blur the boundaries between the delivery mechanisms available for services. As a result of convergence, consumers now have a multitude of ways in which to access telecommunications and media services. Today a person wanting to speak to a colleague or friend can choose whether to dial from a fixed line telephone, pick up a mobile phone or have the conversation over the internet through voiceover IP. A person wanting to read the morning news could pick up a newspaper, turn on a personal computer to log onto the net or get up to date by using their mobile phone. The number and variety of such permutations on the delivery of traditional services will only continue to grow with the high pace of technological change inherent in these industries. </para><para>As the march of technological progress continues and the commercial markets for convergent technologies evolve, regulatory distinctions based on the methods by which services are provided will become increasingly antiquated and inefficient. As such, the current regulatory approach in which legislation distinguishes between services based on the methods by which they are delivered—and through which regulators operate along these increasingly irrelevant divides—is in need of reform. To delay, or to only go halfway in these reforms, will inevitably result in the inefficient distortion of the development of markets for services provided using convergent technologies.</para><para>Regulatory barriers may deter businesses from making some commercially viable services available to consumers. Disparities in the regulatory treatment of services may also result in businesses investing in technologies merely because they enjoy a regulatory advantage in the marketplace instead of being superior products or services. These are not good outcomes for the Australian telecommunications and media industries, and they are not good outcomes for the Australian economy or the Australian people. These risks are further exacerbated by the importance of telecommunications and media markets in the modern Australian economy and the rapid pace of change exhibited in these industries.</para><para>Unfortunately, the pace of reform pursued by the government in this area has been light years behind the pace of technological innovation. This legislation is the government's first legislative attempt to deal with these challenges. Not one, but two discussion papers on these issues have preceded its introduction: the first, <inline font-style="italic">Options for structural reform in spectrum management</inline>, in<inline font-style="italic"></inline>2002 and the second, <inline font-style="italic">New institutional arrangements for the Australian Communications Authority and the Australian Broadcasting Authority</inline>, in 2003. It is legitimate to ask why there has been such a delay in implementing a sorely needed and relatively straightforward reform.</para><para>Governments of other countries, governments which are interested in and committed to allowing their countries' media and telecommunications industries to develop free from inappropriate government interference, addressed these challenges half a decade ago. For example, the Singapore government, active in its desire to promote the emergence of strong, local, telecommunications and media industries, undertook a merger of its equivalent regulators in 1999. The United Kingdom commenced a similar process in 1999 and ultimately merged its equivalent regulators in 2002. It is disappointing that it has taken half a decade for the Howard government to even follow the lead set by others.</para><para>As a result of the absence of leadership from the government on this issue, the existing regulators—the Australian Communications Authority and the Australian Broadcasting Authority—have responded to the emergence of convergent technologies in a necessarily ad hoc and reactionary way. This has led to inefficient overlaps in regulation and regulatory responsibility in some areas and gaps in the regulation of others. In its submission to the Senate committee considering this legislation, the Australian Consumers Association stated that the current regime had produced `some weird interim regulatory responses'. The Competitive Carriers Coalition stated: </para><quote><para>The ACA has increasingly been seen as a follower rather than a leader in terms of regulatory guidance and oversight. This has caused significant duplication and regulatory burden on the industry as a whole.</para></quote><para>The Competitive Carriers Coalition went on to describe the regulators' responses to the emergence of a recent convergent technology, voiceover IP telephony services, as being `poorly coordinated' and requiring industry participants to respond to separate inquiries from the ACA, the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Communications Industry Forum. There has also been significant regulatory duplication in the regulation of mobile content, and unjustified inconsistencies between regulatory approaches to content provided over different mediums—for example, in the age verification requirements for adult content on mobile services compared with those of internet services.</para><para>However, after years of this ad hoc approach to convergence, the growing popularity of convergent technologies such as 3G mobile phones and voiceover IP have finally forced the government's hand. Now that these technologies are becoming commonplace, the government could no longer sit on its hands. And so we now have the Australian Communications and Media Authority Bill.</para><para>The bill is the government's first attempt to deal with these issues. The bill provides for an administrative merger of two existing regulators—the Australian Broadcasting Authority, ABA, and the Australian Communications Authority, ACA—to establish a unified communications regulator: the Australian Communications and Media Authority, or ACMA. As an issue of significant importance to the communications sector, Labor has referred this bill to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee for inquiry so that the adequacy of the legislation can be assessed in detail.</para><para>Having said that, I should add that the primary inadequacy of the bill stems from the government's decision that this merger should be of a purely administrative nature. In accordance with this decision, the bill makes only nominal changes to the existing regulatory frameworks for telecommunications and media. The problem with this is that, while merging regulators will result in a unified approach to the administration of existing legislation, in many cases it is the substance of the underlying legislation itself that is causing inefficiency and regulatory uncertainty. In order to effectively deal with convergence, we should be moving towards a situation in which, all things being equal, regulation is technology neutral. This will require legislative, not simply administrative, reform. While the majority of submissions in response to each of the discussion papers that have been issued by the government have called for a comprehensive review of the underlying regulatory regime in this way, the government has taken the easy option and dodged the hard work necessary to implement the reforms.</para><para>In addition to the fundamentally inadequate philosophy of the bill, Labor also have a number of concerns about how the merger of the Australian Communications and Media Authority will occur. Firstly, we are concerned that allowing the authority to organise itself into divisions and to retain the current bureau offices of the ACA and the ABA will mean that the new authority will be a merged regulator in name only and will in fact continue to operate as two distinct regulators divided in accordance with the delineations of the legacy regulators. We will be exploring whether the organisational and geographic division of the new authority permitted under the bill will undermine the objectives of the merger, and we will pursue this through the Senate inquiry. </para><para>Another of Labor's concerns is that the explanatory memorandum and comments from the former Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, indicate that the merger will be revenue neutral. This represents a significant organisational failure on the part of the government. We find it difficult to understand how the government could not manage any cost savings from a merger that would presumably integrate finance, human resources, and IT support functions of the ABA and the ACA. Telecommunications carriers who have made submissions to the Senate inquiry have rightly pointed out that this is a disappointing result for carriers, as under the current regulatory regime carriers bear the cost of the new authority's telecommunications functions through carrier licence fees. In light of the government's obligation to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent in the most efficient manner, the failure to achieve cost savings from this merger is a poor outcome.</para><para>Finally, I note that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has stated on a number of occasions that the government intends to engage in a review of the effectiveness of the telecommunications regulatory regime in conjunction with the performance of a scoping study for the full sale of Telstra. While it may suit the government's interests in maximising the share price of Telstra prior to sale to hold a private inquiry into the efficiency of the regulatory regime, a far better outcome could be achieved if this review were held in public and enabled interested parties to make submissions on the record on this matter. The government has missed a perfect opportunity to hold such a review as part of the consultation process for this bill.</para><para>The government is creating a new regulator for the communications sector six months before it intends to fully privatise Telstra. Why doesn't the government investigate whether the powers it is providing to the new regulator are appropriate to enable it to achieve its aims in the context of a fully privatised Telstra? Does the introduction of this bill at this stage mean that the government is satisfied that the new authority's powers are sufficient to regulate a fully privatised Telstra, or will we have to go through yet another review in order to ensure that the new authority is able to effectively deal in a regulatory sense with a fully privatised Telstra? The failure of the government to address these issues as part of the introduction of this bill again demonstrates the short-sightedness of the government in this area. Having said that, I also say that Labor supports the package of legislation. The package of legislation represents a modest improvement on the status quo, and I commend the package of legislative measures to the House.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>137</page.no><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TUCKEY</name><name.id>SJ4</name.id><electorate>O'Connor</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I apologise to the House.

We thought that you might have wanted to come down. I thought that the spokesman for the Labor Party, the member for Perth, would have had more to say but he spoke for only 10 minutes. This is major legislation—legislation that I recollect was called for by the opposition who were highly critical of some aspects of the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the major regulator. This legislation amalgamates the Australian Broadcasting Authority and the Australian Communications Authority. They will become the Australian Communication and Media Authority, the ACMA, by 1 July 2005. </para></talk.start></continue><para>During the election campaign the government committed to ensuring that the merger of the ABA and the ACA to form the ACMA is completed efficiently and does not disrupt the ongoing performance of the key regulatory functions of the existing regulators. The <inline ref="R2173">Australian Communications and Media Authority Bill 2004</inline> provides for the establishment of the ACMA on proclamation on 1 July 2005 or, if no proclamation has been made, by that day. Let us look at the history of this particular legislation and the need therefor. The ACMA will be responsible for regulating telecommunications, broadcasting, radio communications and online content. A combined regulator will be better placed to make coordinated responses on conversion issues. In the converging telecommunications and broadcasting environment the maintenance of two separate regulators, both dealing with similar or overlapping issues but focusing on different sectors of the communications industry, is neither practical nor effective.</para><para>New digital technologies allow previous distinct sectors to compete across increasingly convergent markets using a range of different delivery platforms. An issue such as regulating content which can be delivered on 3G mobile phones is a prime example of convergence. As the government has previously stated, it will be an administrative merger and will not be accompanied by changes to the existing regulatory spectrum and planning frameworks for telecommunications and broadcasting. The government is committed to ensuring that the merger is completed efficiently and does not disrupt the ongoing performance of the key regulatory functions of the existing regulators. The existing authorities have in place administrative arrangements to plan for the merger and are well advanced in planning for change. There will be no cost to industry as a result of the merger since there will be no change to the regulatory framework or regulatory functions. There will be no significant saving to government as a result of the merger because all of the regulatory and reporting functions of the ACMA will be the same as those which currently exist in the ACA and the ABA. Staff numbers will remain fairly constant since the new regulatory services to the public and to the industry will remain the same.</para><para>The issue that arises here is that nothing stands still and, of course, in the electronic media today we have this speed of change which is quite outstanding. On the government's initiative, we are more closely approaching the day when analog distribution of television, for instance, will cease and it will all be digital. I think people are gradually coming to terms with that. If I read the newspapers correctly, there have been quite massive sales of plasma and other state-of-the-art digital television equipment during recent times. This was a major contributor to the buoyancy of the retail sector over the Christmas period. The government looks to and welcomes the fact that Labor will support this policy but I think there are some fundamental differences with our policy. The government has indicated on numerous occasions, including during the election campaign, that there will be no immediate savings from this initiative. This is because all regulatory functions will be much the same. Labor has said on several occasions that this merger would result in savings of $70 million, presumably in an effort to fill its budgetary black hole. We say that there will be no savings because the job remains the same. Of course we are well aware that, when you have things like Medicare Gold, there are many other responsibilities that the government has to the community in this regard that were brushed aside to find money. </para><para>I am supportive of a role for government as a regulator. I think that is a significant responsibility of government, be it in competition or in what our media present to us. I think people expect that of us. I am less inclined to government being a physical provider of many services. I have never been able to work out, in the instance of having a private sector as a service provider in education and health, why government also need to be a physical provider of those services. I think we kid ourselves that we do it better and that, in fact, we would do much better to make sure that the money was available to guarantee equity of access and things of that nature, which can be done without setting ourselves up as a major manager in these areas of service. When it comes to the media, to competition policy and to standards and the quality of things that people eat and buy, I see a role for government. I think government is there to ensure fairness and quality, and all the other things that people expect and have to have confidence in government to deliver. So this new body will quite sensibly cover both of those arrangements, and I think that is important.</para><para>I also think that we have some great challenges as a parliament in looking at how the communications system will operate. I for one have been quite saddened by the loss of the individualisation of electronic media that existed when I first became the member for O'Connor. We had a television station in Geraldton, one in Albany and other services dotted around. Then of course we had progress and it all became GWN, a satellite distributor that covers all of rural Western Australia, and in a later period we got WIN television. They provide good services but they are barely localised. I have always wondered why in my electorate, the Kalgoorlie electorate in particular, and I guess the Forrest electorate—the big rural electorates surrounding Perth—when a third licence was considered we could not have had the opportunity of going back to a series of smaller services that were distinctly local. That is, local services which did not give us <inline font-style="italic">Neighbours</inline> and all that soap opera stuff. What is the latest—`Dissatisfied Wives'? I thought they might cover the local football match or the local cricket match.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YU5</name.id><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Tanner</name></talker><para>—<inline font-style="italic">Desperate Housewives</inline>; a good show.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TUCKEY</name></talker><para>—I am not into them, personally. When I want trouble I can create it for myself. Coming back to the issue, I always thought there could be a TV station in small towns that covered the local weddings. I think people might be interested in that, if that were a choice. They would still of course have the opportunity to watch `Dissatisfied Wives' or <inline font-style="italic">The X Factor</inline> or, if you really want to get down to the lowest of things, <inline font-style="italic">Big Brother</inline> or something like that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>These are the things that government looks at from time to time as a regulator. We certainly have changed our attitudes over the years, and today we approve things on television that one would not have dreamed of years ago. I am open-minded about that, but there is always going to be a time when we expect of the media that they deliver a product to a standard that is acceptable to the Australian people. Therefore, I am totally supportive of this particular proposal. There is huge growth in radio and new entrants are coming on in the immediate future, and there will be a great battle for advertising revenue.</para><para>We are yet to see how the cabinet will eventually approach the idea of more deregulation throughout the entire media, between print and electronic media. That is an interesting challenge and, again, I think it is appropriate. I am not sure that it is going to change much. We worry a bit about media domination, but I have yet to see any huge influence by media proprietors on their journalists. They seem to be able to run things much as they wish. I think that that professor missed out, as quoted by the minister for education this morning, in complaining about school teachers not doing enough. I thought maybe they should educate a few journalists to have a broader view of how politics operate in Australia. But I do not think that pressure comes from media owners. Of course in this day and age a lot of the ownership is with the fund managers and, as a consequence, the role of government is to see that reasonable standards are maintained in terms of the quality of the product, not the opinions of the journalists who work there. Having made those points and having taken the opportunity to describe to the parliament again what the purpose of this legislation is, I will conclude my remarks. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>140</page.no><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name><name.id>YU5</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition support the merger of the ACA and the ABA into a single body and did so prior to the election, so we broadly support the legislation before the House. It reflects a pattern that is occurring in other parts of the world—for example, the creation of Ofcom in the United Kingdom as a single regulator spanning an even broader remit, including telecommunications and various other things that are not necessarily going to be within the ACMA remit. It certainly spans the bulk of what is going to be within the ACMA remit as part of the legislation that is before the House.</para></talk.start><para>There is an underlying issue I wish to address that I think has caused some concern in sections of the broadcasting industry and which will ultimately have to be addressed. It has been put to one side as a result of this legislation being put to the House, but nonetheless it is something that we have to think about for the future—that is, the open contestability of spectrum. At the moment we operate spectrum in this country on the basis that particular sections of spectrum are set aside for certain purposes, in this case for radio and television broadcasting. So, in effect, that spectrum is quarantined from broader market forces, and the prospect of other players—such as people in telecommunications, mobile telephony and wireless internet—being able to potentially outbid broadcasters for that spectrum does not arise.</para><para>The resistance to the merger of the ABA and the ACA that has been in the industry for some considerable time was ultimately sourced in this concern—that, by merging the regulators, you would end up with an effective merger of the way that spectrum is dealt with and ultimately an open market for spectrum use. Broadly, I have some sympathy with that view, but I think it will be some time before our society is ready for that—indeed, some time before the various sectors are ready for that. I believe that we should continue to support the notion of a separate role for broadcasting in our society—and, in particular, for radio and television broadcasting as we have known them—and I believe that spectrum should continue to be set aside for those purposes.</para><para>It is extremely important that all Australians be able to continue to have access to services that are delivered to them for free, effectively—although they pay indirectly through advertising—through radio and television. It is very important that we continue to guarantee that those services will be able to be provided and that we ensure that those industries can grow and diversify, that there is more competition and there are more services and different products. Ultimately there will be genuine convergence and what we today know as television, in particular, will cease to exist in the form that we currently know it because of technological change. But that is much overhyped and will be some distance away. For the foreseeable future, we as a society need to maintain a separate regulatory arrangement for broadcasting to ensure that spectrum will be there. </para><para>It is important that we have a genuinely expert nonpolitical regulator. One of the things that I would urge upon the government, once this legislation is passed and once the boss of the new organisation is appointed, is that we do not see any more David Flints—that we do not see any more political stooges who are there to run their own political agendas—and that we do not have an organisation that is unduly soft in the application of its regulatory and administrative roles. We need an organisation that will clamp down on miscreants and actually enforce the rules. In some respects, I felt that the former Australian Communications Authority was a bit soft in its administration of consumer protection provisions in telecommunications, for example. There are a number of lessons that we can learn from what has occurred in the recent past to ensure that the new authority has integrity, strength and impartiality and that it is genuinely an expert based authority making decisions in accordance with the legislation and the wishes of the parliament, on the basis of the merits of the issues and not on the basis of political bias—as was the case with Professor Flint—or on the basis of any other extraneous matters.</para><para>This legislation does point to the early stages of a wave of quite revolutionary change that is going to hit broadcasting in this country, and we are seeing only the very early stages of it. The transition to digital has been painfully slow in this country. It is really not gathering serious momentum and there are some major new decisions that the government will have to face up to at some point. There are questions about whether there should be further competition in television broadcasting and whether multichannelling should be allowed. There are questions about whether we should allow, in what is supposedly a high-tech industry, the kind of competition and open entry to the marketplace that is now taken for granted in virtually all other industries or whether we should continue to stick with an antiquated regulatory framework that reflects a bygone world.</para><para>If you think about it, we have seen very little change in television for 25 years. The last major change in Australian television, in true impact, was the entry of SBS—and I acknowledge the presence in the parliament today of the member for Kooyong, who had a significant role in the creation of SBS. That was the last major development in Australian television—25 years ago or thereabouts. It is a sector that has not changed very much since that time, yet the technology has changed enormously and is going to change even further. I believe that, unless the technological change wave that is starting to gather momentum is adapted to by television as we know it, it will ultimately disappear. There are really major challenges emerging for the broadcasting sector—for radio as well as television—and, yes, they are entitled to a continued place in the broadcasting spectrum. They are entitled to a continuing role in our society, but they are not entitled to undue protection from competition or from the implications of technological change.</para><para>So whether it is the transition to digital in radio, the prospect of satellite radio, the question of additional licences in television or the question of multichannelling, there is no question about where I stand on these issues: I am in favour of reform, I am in favour of progress, I am in favour of allowing technological change and market forces to give better products, more choice, more diversity and more jobs for Australian consumers and for Australian society. There are some difficult micro issues to be dealt with, but it is about time the government started to front up to those issues instead of ducking and weaving, which it has done for a number of years. It is about time the government started to front up to those issues and to institute a serious reform agenda in Australian broadcasting. </para><para>There are lots of things that we could do. There is significant change occurring in other jurisdictions. If you look at what is happening with digital television in Britain, for example, you will see the impact of pursuing a progressive mechanism for introducing digital TV there, whereas it has been a dismal failure thus far in Australia, in spite of all the hype that has been put forward. We have got to take these issues and move with them and move with technological change and allow the broadcasting sector to flourish, to genuinely innovate and to build on and improve what it delivers for Australia. Some of that has happened in radio. More competition has led to more activity, more jobs, more revenue and much greater diversity of product for Australian consumers—and much more choice in radio. I believe that we need to follow that pattern in television as well and then we will have a better sector and a better society.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>142</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Frank was born Francis Clive Churchill in September 1931 in Melbourne. He grew up in Port Melbourne and attended the Albert Park Primary School and South Melbourne Technical College, before undertaking a butcher's apprenticeship. Frank was married at 19 to Ellen and, to quote Frank, he has `completed 54 years' of marriage, no doubt a significant achievement in itself. Ellen and Frank had five children, one of whom is now deceased, and they are now the proud grandparents of 13 grandchildren and three great grandchildren. I have met one of Frank's grandchildren, Steven—who is studying the VCE at Gladstone Park Secondary College. Steven Churchill is a fabulous young man with a brilliant mind, and I have no doubt that he will go on one day to achieve great things.</para></talk.start><para>Frank Churchill moved to Broadmeadows in 1957 and has continued to reside there since, educating all of his children in Broadmeadows. Typical of members of the local community, Frank is a proud Broadmeadows resident. Frank has been a member of Freemasonry Victoria for the past 40 years and during his career he has worked as a butcher, milkman, painter and docker, truck driver and firefighter.</para><para>In 1956, Frank joined the Metropolitan Fire Brigade. He retired after 32 years in 1988. During his time at the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, Frank was an active life member of the United Firefighters Union, for whom he served as a shop steward. He was a member of the committee of management before becoming president and then being elected as secretary. In 1975 Frank was appointed commissioner on the inaugural occupational health and safety commission, representing the Victorian Trades Hall Council. Along with other commissioners, he received a WorkSafe Victoria Award in 2004, in recognition of this work.</para><para>Also in 1975, Frank became the foundation director of the Firefighters Credit Union and was an active participant on the credit union's steering committee. Frank completed 27 years continuous service as director and was elected in October 2004 for a further three-year term. He was made an Associate Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Credit Union Directors in 2004. In addition to these positions, Frank became a director in 2001 on the inaugural board of Northern Support Services—formerly the Helping Hand Association for people with disabilities—a position he still holds today. </para><para>In December 1982, as a senior fireman, Frank was honoured with the National Medal for diligent long service to the community in hazardous circumstances, including in times of emergency and national disaster in direct protection of life and property. On Australia Day this year, Frank was honoured with the Medal of the Order of Australia for services to the community, through support for social welfare organisations for people with disabilities, particularly through the Northern Support Services group, and for services to the emergency services, through the United Firefighters Union and the Firefighters Credit Union. A search of the Australian honours list shows that Frank is only the second person from Broadmeadows to receive such an honour, the only other being Stephen Collins in 1984. We in Broadmeadows are very proud of Frank Churchill for that achievement.</para><para>I attended the Australia Day presentation ceremony at the Broadmeadows Town Hall and it was an absolute delight to see such a deserving recipient awarded the honour of the Medal of the Order of Australia. At the congratulatory luncheon held the following Sunday and attended by a great number of Frank's friends and well wishers, I extended my personal congratulations to Frank and presented him with a certificate of congratulations. Tonight, I would like to formally record my congratulations to Frank Churchill OAM, a proud Broadmeadows resident whose achievements are to be commended. I congratulate Frank for his many achievements and I particularly congratulate him for being honoured this year with the Order of Australia medal. Frank, you are a very deserving recipient, and I am proud to be your representative in the federal parliament.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Mr Andy Hall</title><page.no>143</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>143</page.no><name role="metadata">Georgiou, Petro, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GEORGIOU</name><name.id>HM5</name.id><electorate>Kooyong</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This House is extremely well served by members of the House of Representatives staff—by their advice, by their assistance and, more than occasionally, by their simple human kindness. Sometimes our colleagues are unkind to us and the staff actually fill the gap. I think this observation is true of all House of Representatives staff, from the people who say hello in the morning to the people who give us glasses of water—for some obscure reason we seem to be incapable of getting them ourselves. Tonight I would like to pay tribute to Andy Hall. Andy has notified the Department of the House of Representatives of his intention to resign as an employee, effective from the middle of this month.</para></talk.start><para>Of all the jobs in the parliament, looking after members of parliament across the range of their equipment, printing and IT needs—not least of which is the dreaded hand-held computer—must be a bit like undertaking the labours of Hercules. The task is usually enhanced by the astonishingly good manners of members of the House of Representatives—not least when they are under pressure or computers go down. To do the job with grace, patience and concern you need the qualities possessed by Andy Hall. No wonder Andy's hair has gone prematurely white.</para><para>As a member of parliament, I have known Andy Hall for a decade. He has been the epitome of two things: firstly, can-do professionalism and responsiveness, and, secondly—and this is worth underscoring—a gentlemanly kindness. Andy has always bent over backwards to discharge the substance of responsibilities rather than merely the form of them, and I think most of us have benefited when he has tried to help us make things work—rather than just saying that it cannot be done. </para><para>Andy commenced work with the department in August 1986 as a sessional attendant. In September 1987 he moved into the transport office and then to the stationery store in 1988. In 1991 Andy was promoted to the position of printing manager—and I think some of us have had first-hand experience of his enormous capacity to get things done against astonishingly tight deadlines, often imposed upon him by unreasonable members of parliament. Since 2000 Andy has been involved in the support of IT equipment. I am not sure that that exactly made his day, but he was astonishingly good at it. Andy received an Australia Day medal in 1993 and was also awarded a medal for his contribution to the Australian Public Service on its centenary in June 2001. I still remember that ceremony.</para><para>Andy exemplifies the qualities that are found in all recipients of the Australia Day medallion, especially those relating to advancing the quality and the perceptions of House of Representatives services and caring for the welfare of his colleagues. The type of work he has been doing so energetically in respect of member services in a number of fields and his activities above and beyond the call of duty have made him a very important part of the lives of members and friends. On behalf of all members, I would like to wish him and his wife Pam all the best in the next phase of their lives—I hope it is the best phase of their lives too—and to thank him genuinely for all the assistance he has given to members.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Walter Construction Group</title><page.no>144</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>144</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Australian building workers and small businesses are being forced to grapple with yet another corporate collapse—that of the Walter Construction Group. The administrators have described the group as `hopelessly insolvent'. They have warned retrenched employees that there is little prospect of receiving their full entitlements as a result of this collapse. How could such a major construction company be `hopelessly insolvent' during a sustained building boom? Didn't anyone in authority see the collapse coming? And does anyone in authority really care?</para></talk.start><para>The Walter Group owes $18 million to permanent employees. Since the group's realisable assets are valued at between $17 million and $26 million and it has only $10 million in liquid assets, and since it also owes creditors $90 million, the employees look like ending up high and dry. The government promised years ago that it would legislate to rank employees above creditors but has never fulfilled that promise. So the employees will be left to the mercy of the government's General Employee Entitlement Scheme, otherwise known as GEERS. If you believed the former Minister for Small Business and Tourism, the employees would get 100 per cent of their entitlements through GEERS. During the election campaign, where truth seems to be an early casualty, in an interview on Radio 2UE's Steve Price program on 30 August the following exchange occurred. Minister Hockey said:</para><quote><para>Well, we already have a fund that covers employee entitlements and we do that, we have that fund because we've done the hard yards on managing our budget and we have the funds available so that we do not have to increase taxes.</para></quote><para>The member for Sydney, Ms Plibersek, asked: </para><quote><para>Do they get a hundred per cent of their entitlements, Joe?</para></quote><para>Mr Hockey replied:</para><quote><para>Yes, they do. Yes, they do.</para></quote><para>That is what the minister for small business at the time said—that, under GEERS, employees receive 100 per cent of their entitlements. The fact is that GEERS does not pay 100 per cent of employee entitlements. GEERS is capped at eight weeks redundancy pay and does not cover any unpaid superannuation. These limits are publicised on the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations website—www.workplace.gov.au—on the employee entitlements webpage.</para><para>Documents obtained through freedom of information reveal that these limits on GEERS and other limits have left working Australians more than $35.3 million out of pocket. The FOI documents reveal that the Howard government is pretending to protect employee entitlements but is short-changing one in five claimants—that is, almost 4,000 working Australians—by an average of $9,000 each. So you have the minister for small business at the time saying that 100 per cent of employee entitlements are paid, yet the FOI documents reveal the truth—that almost 4,000 working Australians have been short-changed by an average of $9,000 each.</para><para>The only employees who have received 100 per cent protection of their entitlements are those of the Prime Minister's brother Stan. As a result of that scandal, Labor and the general community were able to shame this government into introducing a limited employee entitlements scheme known as GEERS. In contrast, Labor took to the election a proposal to cover 100 per cent of employee entitlements, including superannuation, and it was that scheme that the former minister for small business was criticising in that 2UE radio interview on that day. That is why he was on radio: because he was criticising Labor's proposal to protect 100 per cent of employee entitlements while pretending that the government's own scheme did just that, and of course it does not.</para><para>The government claims it is the party of small business and it wants to protect contractors. It has foreshadowed legislation about that. But what about the subcontractors to the Walker Group working on its 30-odd projects? They will take a big hit, but of course they will try to stay solvent. They will not be entitled to GEERS, since they are not the employees of an insolvent company. Who is going to look after the subbies? Not the Howard government, which pays lip-service to protecting contractors. Here is an opportunity for the government to put its money where its mouth is, to take an active interest in the plight of both employees and subcontractors. It is expected that at least 500 employees will be retrenched on Friday. I call on the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to involve himself personally and not wait for the gears of GEERS to grind slowly forward, eventually paying part of the entitlements owed. If the government were interested in anything but pre-election political rhetoric, it would involve itself in this unfolding disaster.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Nuclear Science Technology Organisation</title><page.no>145</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>145</page.no><name role="metadata">Vale, Danna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs VALE</name><name.id>VK6</name.id><electorate>Hughes</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I would like to increase awareness in this House of the new and forthcoming capabilities of the Australian Nuclear Science Technology Organisation, ANSTO, our country's nuclear research and development organisation and the centre of Australian nuclear expertise, which I am very proud to say is located in my electorate of Hughes.

I would also like to acknowledge the students in my electorate from St John Bosco College who helped with suggestions that influenced the new name. </para></talk.start><para>The minister also launched the new state-of-the-art $3.2 million Small Tandem for Applied Research particle accelerator, otherwise known as STAR. STAR offers Australian researchers, particularly universities, world-class ion beam and accelerator mass spectrometry capabilities to conduct studies into the environment, archaeology, heritage, biology and materials. STAR will also be able to do important work such as carbon dating and forensic analysis. It will help to accommodate increasing scientific demands and also encourage innovative Australian research in fields where this was previously problematic.</para><para>Of even more significance is OPAL. The new reactor will be a world-class neutron source capable of supporting up to 17 neutron beam instruments. The first eight of these instruments are currently under construction. The scope of research that these instruments will allow is tremendous, from research on advanced materials through to molecular biology and using technologies that were unknown at the time the first reactor was built.</para><para>As well as opening up new areas of research, ANSTO is well known as the principal producer and supplier of radioisotopes for medical diagnosis, treatment and pain relief in Australia. Last year approximately 550,000 patient treatments were transported from ANSTO to hospitals all around Australia, and increasingly in South-East Asia as well. Nuclear medicines are chiefly used for diagnosis, but increasingly also to treat disease and for pain relief. For example, bone scans can detect the spread of cancers six to 18 months sooner than X-rays can.</para><para>With the replacement research reactor, ANSTO will have sufficient flux to be able to produce not just diagnostic nuclear medicines but a great range of therapeutic medicines as well. We can go on to actually treat cancers and tumours by injections with nuclear medicine. ANSTO also conducts new research aimed at developing new radiation treatments for different types of cancer and other medical conditions. Of course, ANSTO's expertise in these fields will increase as the replacement research reactor comes on line.</para><para>With additional capacity, ANSTO will also be able to expand its support for the Australian manufacturing, minerals and agricultural industries. The estimated gross benefit of support for the minerals industry, for example, currently exceeds $100 million annually. The replacement reactor will give us significantly more. This modern facility will attract eminent foreign scientists to work in Australia and provide Australian scientists with greater reciprocal access to complementary first-class research facilities around the world. As people can see, the return to Australia from this reactor will indeed be significant.</para><para>In terms of general everyday uses of radioactivity, examples include radioactive materials that are used to test the quality of steel in automobiles; aircraft manufacturers using radiation to check for flaws in jet engines; and mining and petroleum companies using radionuclides to locate and quantify mineral deposits. Manufacturers use radioactive materials to obtain the proper thickness of tin and aluminium; pipeline companies use radioactive materials to look for defects in welds; and oil, gas and mining companies use radioactive materials to map geological contours, using test wells and mine bores, and to determine the presence of hydrocarbons. By showing how plants absorb fertiliser, radioactive materials help researchers to learn when fertiliser should be applied and how much is needed. This helps prevent the overuse of fertiliser as a major source of soil and water pollution. Radioactivity is also used in sterilisation techniques to control insect pests such as fruit flies, which is very important in agricultural Australia. Smoke detectors rely on a tiny source of radioactivity source to sound the alarm when they sense smoke from a fire. Irradiation of silicon for the semiconductor industry is significant business for ANSTO. Cosmetics, hair products and contact lens solutions are sterilised with radiation to remove irritants and allergens. And this is to name just a few applications. </para><para>This marks the beginning of a new phase in Australian science. I can proudly say that, in my electorate, this reactor is really an Aussie gem. I will be speaking to the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads regarding a pressing need for a serious upgrading of the road used by ANSTO and its employees. This is the Illawarra road, and I have every confidence in the minister. He will address this important local issue.

Given the increasing involvement that Australia is now having with the Pacific—I would suggest far too late—under this government, it is a particularly interesting area to spend time in. Next week I will be looking for an opportunity to give a much more detailed account of the visit, the things that I learned and some of the suggestions that I would make arising from the visit. But in the very limited time I have this evening, I want to touch on two matters.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, I want to add to the contributions of others in this House by offering my condolences to the relatives and friends of Adam Dunning, the fine young Australian policeman who was murdered in quite cowardly circumstances in Honiara just before Christmas. Being in that place brings home to one the sacrifice that some people have to make to achieve the objectives that on a bipartisan basis are supported in the Australian parliament. Adam's sacrifice needs to be remembered in Australia forever.</para><para>Shortly after Adam's murder, I publicly suggested that it would be appropriate for the Australian government, in consultation with his family, to find some ongoing way of commemorating his service. I suggested that one possible way would be to endow a scholarship for a young Solomon Islander of great promise to allow him or her to be educated in Australia. I am still not aware of any decision by the government on that matter, and I look forward to a government decision.</para><para>Given the scale of Australia's commitment, and particularly given the scale of resources from our police that are now required in the Pacific, including the Solomon Islands, the morale of police is critically important. I have to say that the young Australian men and women serving in the Solomons are very fine people, and their morale is high. However, there are some matters that need attention fairly promptly in order to maintain that.</para><para>In visiting the Australian base just out of Honiara—GBR as it is called—I found that there were some problems with Australians maintaining contact with loved ones and friends back in Australia. At that base there are only four public phones available to our police personnel to call back to Australia, and there is no real privacy associated with the use of those phones. That is something that I think is going to adversely affect personnel unless it is addressed very quickly. There are over 100 police—not just Australians, but Australians are probably the largest contingent—at that location, and they are expected to maintain contact with loved ones back in their homeland from four very public phones with, as I say, no privacy. Moreover, there are only six internet connections available for that place. </para><para>I sincerely hope that the people who are responsible for these matters will give prompt attention to upgrading the capacity of young Australians and young Pacific Islanders who are serving together, to maintain connections. They need to do that in order to continue the support that they get emotionally and otherwise from friends and relatives in Australia. I will have more to say about that and a couple of other matters on an occasion when I have more time.</para><para>The other matter I want to briefly comment on is the pride I had in being an Australian present when the Australian under-20 soccer team won the Oceania championship in Honiara last Monday week. It defeated the Solomon Islands 3-0. However, the Solomon Islands were not shamed. They did extraordinarily well to get into the finals. They defeated New Zealand, Fiji and Vanuatu to get there and they played very well.</para><para>Unfortunately, the occasion was marred by some rowdy and bad behaviour by some people in the vicinity of the match. I gather there was some doubt about whether the international soccer authorities would agree to allow the Socceroos to play in the Solomon Islands later this year for qualification for the World Cup—the Oceania qualification. I understand that the soccer authorities have now, with conditions, agreed to allow Honiara to be used for that important event later in the year, and that is a very positive development for soccer and for the Solomon Islands. I congratulate the authorities on making a decision to not remove the World Cup qualifier from Honiara later this year. I also wish the Australian under-20s great success when they go to Holland later this year, in June, and play in the world championships there.

Over the months prior to the Christmas and New Year break I received hundreds of emails, faxes and phone calls about problems associated with the pressure placed on payers of support following broken marriages. As a result of all of those particular faxes, emails and calls, I am very much aware of the failure of successive governments and ministers of the Crown to detect and rectify the anti male culture endemic in the Child Support Agency.</para></talk.start><para>More importantly, since then I have been getting additional faxes, emails and phone calls to the point where I now have three files containing hundreds and hundreds of cases of what can only be described as the disgraceful results of actions by the Child Support Agency. I believe that in most cases it is abusing its powers and is misusing the act under which it operates. The information that I have proves conclusively that the actions of the Child Support Agency have had a significant impact on male suicide. It has certainly had an impact on bankruptcies. It has caused breakdown, heartache and pressures for new families where payers of support have tried to get on with their life and create new relationships. It has pursued the illegal and abusive use of its powers by accessing people's bank accounts, which I have referred to in the past. </para><para>These stories, from people from all over Australia, have reinforced and confirmed to me that the thing I feared is in fact operating. Institutionalised sexism is endemic and operating in the Child Support Agency and, to a lesser degree, in the Family Court. I have been so concerned about this particular issue that I have had preliminary talks with the commissioner who deals, within and outside the government, with issues of sex discrimination. I have asked the commissioner to sit down and give me an overall brief on what her role is, how her charter operates and how she, as the commissioner, is required to operate it. I did that on the basis of forewarning her that I am going to lodge an official complaint, as a member of parliament, about the anti male bias in the way the Child Support Agency operates and its obviously institutionalised sexism against males.</para><para>I will do that because I can no longer tolerate and bear to read about and absorb the pain and suffering that is occurring because of the way in which they operate. Publicly, they declare that their task is to provide child support but it is, in fact, spousal maintenance, which is destroying lives and careers. I can no longer allow that to happen and I am going to pursue this issue. If it takes this and the next term of government to get a final conclusion—such as the Child Support Agency being restructured or removed and replaced with some other form of child support that lives and operates within the realm of reasonableness in the Australian community—then that is the way it is going to have to be. Unfortunately, that may not go down too well with some of my parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the House, and it certainly may not go down too well with some of the ministers of the Crown in this place. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ministerial Reply</title><page.no>149</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>149</page.no><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LLOYD</name><name.id>IK6</name.id><electorate>Robertson</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I note comments by the member for Hughes earlier in the debate and I want to make a statement to the House in reply. Earlier today, I gave an undertaking to the House to make some inquiries on particular matters relating to the Tumbi Creek Regional Partnerships funding. I am advised of the following. On 9 June 2004, the Wyong council in New South Wales voted to adopt on-land disposal of dredge spoil from Tumbi Creek. The dredging and associated works were required to prevent potential flooding of nearby houses on Tumbi Creek, and to prevent some 15,000 cubic metres of silt from Tumbi Creek being deposited on the floor of the Tuggerah Lake system. This problem had been the subject of correspondence between Wyong Shire Council and the New South Wales government as far back as December 2003, and between the member for Dobell, Mr Ken Ticehurst, and the NSW and Australian governments. There were proposals for assistance from both governments in resolving this issue.</para></talk.start><para>Wyong council's June 2004 proposal was predicated on the state and federal governments providing matching grants—some $680,000 in addition to council's $680,000. Council's decision to propose this project was based on detailed study by its director of engineering services and after consideration and agreement by the full council. On 10 June 2004, the Department of Transport and Regional Services, DOTARS, received an application from Wyong council. The department commenced assessment of that Regional Partnerships application. On 23 June 2004, the department provided briefing to the then parliamentary secretary, the Hon.

The grant was announced by the member for Dobell on 1 July 2004. It will be recalled that Wyong council's application was predicated on matching funds from both the federal and state governments. When it became clear that the New South Wales government would not provide matching funding, Wyong council gave further consideration to the issue. On 1 July 2004 Wyong council lodged a revised application seeking an additional $680,000 from Regional Partnerships. On 11 July 2004 the then parliamentary secretary approved the additional funding request because the project was regarded as sufficiently important to justify the additional funding. On 26 August 2004 details of the total grant were announced.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There was considerable rain in October 2004 and subsequent media reports, such as the <inline font-style="italic">Central Coast Advocate </inline>of 12 November 2004, reported that the rain had `flushed' the silt blocking the mouth of Tumbi Creek. This led to some local speculation, including by a councillor, that funds might be used for other projects. On 17 November 2004 Mr Hallett of my office sought advice from my department on the implications of the flushing of the creek. The department's advice was that:</para><quote><para>The two projects agreed by Mrs Kelly regarding Tumbi Creek are yet to be contracted and will be impacted upon by the recent removal of the blockage at the mouth of Tumbi Creek. The approved projects were to deliver the following three outcomes:</para><para>access for recreational boats to Tuggerah Lake;</para><para>improved water quality in Tumbi Creek;</para><para>mitigation of flood risks to low lying properties near the creek mouth.</para><para>The department is currently waiting for advice from Wyong Council regarding the implications of the recent removal of the blockage at the mouth of Tumbi Creek on the dredging project. A revised project schedule and costing will be negotiated with the Council.</para><para>If this results in reduced project costs, it is proposed that the Commonwealth will reduce its grant contribution until project costs are equally shared by Wyong Council and the Commonwealth (ie, until total project costs fall under $1.36 million ... all the costs saving will reduce the Commonwealth's ... after that threshold cost savings will be shared equally by the Council and the Commonwealth.</para><para>If Wyong Council wishes to revise the project to include outcomes beyond those agreed by Mrs Kelly (eg `upstream bank erosion works') this would require a formal request by the Council for the consideration of the Parliamentary Secretary, Mr John Cobb.</para></quote><para>The status of Tumbi Creek was reviewed by the council's Director of Engineering Services and he reported to council on the situation and the scope of works required on 24 November 2004. Wyong council has provided a verbatim transcript of the advice tendered by the Director of Engineering Services, Mr David Cathers. This advice was tendered at the ordinary meeting of council and would have been easily obtained by the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues before they made the false allegations raised in the House earlier today. Any of the three Labor representatives on the Wyong council could have provided it. The substance of his report was that, while approximately 1,000 cubic metres of soil had been disposed of by the recent rains, they were dealing with a situation in which 15,000 cubic metres needed to be dealt with. The Director of Engineering Services concluded:</para><quote><para>In terms of raising the issue about `is there any need to do any further work?' It is a very valid question and it is indeed worthwhile identifying and that is what we've done but further work does need doing. </para></quote><para>I table that report from the Director of Engineering Services from Wyong council. At all times this matter has been dealt with properly. To date no money has been paid. Funds cannot be used for purposes other than those approved, and any funds that are not required will be retained by the Commonwealth. I am advised that contracts are yet to be signed and can assure the House that funds will only be provided for a proper purpose. The claim that there has been a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth of funds is ridiculous and the Leader of the Opposition should immediately apologise to all those people he so lightly slandered earlier today.

The first is Jean Kent. Jean wrote to me in November last year to let me know that she had been awarded a grant of $20,000 by the Literature Board of the Australia Council for the Arts to work on her fifth collection of poetry. She has a book in the making which has a working title of `Mangoes and Madeleines'. She says this `will explore and celebrate places where a variety of contemporary Australians feel at home'. She has lived and worked in Lake Macquarie and the Hunter Valley since 1983 and says `you can be sure that these places will have starring roles!' Jean writes:</para></talk.start><quote><para>This grant will be invaluable for my writing of the poems. Making any sort of living from literary writing is very difficult and funding from the Australia Council provides both an acknowledgement that this is valued work <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> time to concentrate on that work, without the distractions and stresses of other employment. I am very grateful for the support of literature through this program.</para></quote><para>Jean grew up in Queensland. She began publishing poetry in 1971 and, as she said, she has lived in Lake Macquarie since 1983 and is currently a lecturer in creative writing at the University of Newcastle. The subject of this new collection of poems, as I said, will range from Lake Macquarie and the Hunter Valley to Paris and Lithuania in order to explore and celebrate places where a variety of contemporary Australians feel at home. I pay tribute to Jean Kent.</para><para>The other creative young person in my electorate that I would like to speak about is Nikki Wilson-Smith. Nikki arrived in Canberra on the weekend along with another 36 young Australians for the Heywire Youth Issues Forum. This forum enables 16- to 22-year-olds to discuss issues relevant to them with Australia's political and cultural leaders. In about 20 minutes time, I am going to have a chance to meet with Nikki Wilson-Smith. Nikki produced a radio story for our local ABC radio in Newcastle as part of the Heywire program, focusing on the issue of Sudanese refugees who have settled in Newcastle and who have recently been the subject of a disgusting racist campaign. However, she speaks of befriending Sudanese refugees and how she experienced racism herself. When in Vietnam buying guitar strings, she was kicked out of a shop because she was white. Experiencing that racial hatred has inspired this 21-year-old to embrace multiculturalism and to embrace other cultures in our community. I congratulate her for it and look forward to speaking with her. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Master Butchers Cooperative Centenary Book</title><page.no>152</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>152</page.no><name role="metadata">Draper, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DRAPER</name><name.id>0L6</name.id><electorate>Makin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On Saturday night I had the great honour and pleasure of representing the Hon.

I want to pay tribute today to one of the three authors, Rada Turner, who lives in Pooraka in my electorate of Makin. It was a great pleasure on the night to pay tribute to her work, along with that of the other two authors. </para></talk.start><para>I want to congratulate the board of directors for commissioning this book to chronicle the events in the history of the meat industry in South Australia from its beginnings in 1905. The authors have done an extraordinary job. The book was a year in production. Not only have the authors contributed to the Master Butchers Cooperative historical record, but they have made an immensely important contribution to South Australian history and the history of our great nation. From the very beginning of the book the authors take us through a delightful journey of facts, anecdotes, mateship and yarns that trace the struggles, hardships, diligence and devotion of the many and varied members of the MBL, who worked to continue the foundation of one of the most successful cooperatives to operate anywhere in the world. Of course, there are too many to be named individually, and I must leave that to others.</para><para>The journey also takes us through the battle for hides and skins, drought, World War I, the roaring twenties, the Depression years, World War II, our relationship with the Empire, the advent of the butchers picnic and the annual ball, Hyde's Patent Bar and women in the meat industry. At this point I would like to acknowledge the special tribute paid by the authors in chapter 4 to women in the meat industry. As the authors stated, there were two groups of women around which the meat industry revolved: those who were married to or were children of members and those who were not. Wives were often accorded great respect, such as in the article written by spyglass in the <inline font-style="italic">Master Butcher </inline>on 5 June 1939.

It is an area full of young home owners and young families, and one that is filled with enormous community spirit. On weekends these people and families visit Strathaird Reserve and the Amberly Park Shopping Centre—a fairly innovative shopping centre that was opened in about October 2003 and has been incredibly well supported by the community. The shopping centre has a supermarket, a newsagent, a bank and financial services office and other shops. In April, it will even have a fully bulk-billing medical office, which will have about nine professional suites. It is a growing shopping centre which is actually a community hub.</para></talk.start><para>It may surprise those present to know, having provided this fulsome description of the shopping centre, that one thing it does not have is an Australia Post box. That is a rather absurd situation. This shopping centre has been open for 16 months and has roughly 25,000 people going through it per week using the facilities and the businesses. Aki Giorgio is a young small business owner who personifies Narre Warren South. He lives there, he is a battler and he has established a newsagency in Amberly Park Shopping Centre. About 200 people a day use Aki's newsagency and many of them say the same thing: `We pay our taxes. We work hard in the community. We are going to have a fully bulk-billing medical centre, but we're not going to have an Australia Post box!' </para><para>We have made numerous representations to Australia Post with respect to this issue, and they say there is postbox in the Casey Central Shopping Centre, which is roughly 2.6 kilometres away from the Amberly Park Shopping Centre.

They would see that Narre Warren South has two very distinct geographical areas: one is situated around Berwick Springs and the other is based around the Amberly Park Shopping Centre, which does not have an Australia Post facility.</para><para>It is no wonder that people get very upset about governments and feel powerless. Aki Giorgio has been lobbying for 16 months to get something as basic as one red Australia Post box. He has written letters, we have tabled petitions and he has not got it. Australia Post say in their mission statement that they want to deliver high-quality services to the people of the region. It is about time that they delivered on their mission statement.

There are a number of groups that I would like to acknowledge in particular for their generosity.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, the Western Port Oberon Association, inspired by the work of Wendy Kelly, a woman of Sri Lankan descent, gathered together enormous amounts of food, clothing and other items as well as some funding to assist victims of the tsunami in Sri Lanka. They gave many hours of their time. Led by Wendy, they put in an enormous effort and have dispatched a huge quantity of desperately needed materials to the people of Sri Lanka. So I very specifically want to say to Wendy Kelly and to the Western Port Oberon Association, led by Max Bryant: thank you for the generosity and the time you have given. It is a wonderful demonstration of common humanity, compassion and the generosity which is always within the community.</para><para>The second group I want to acknowledge is the Rotary Club of Phillip Island. The Rotary Club on Phillip Island put together what you might call a coin table, where people were encouraged to put down a gold coin. Through that process, where the table was in the main shopping centre of Cowes on Phillip Island, they filled the table four times. Each table had approximately $8,000 worth of coins on it, so through that one simple process of coin donations they raised $32,000 over a couple of weeks. It was an extraordinarily simple but effective process. Similarly, both Rotary and Lions in Westernport and Hastings raised a significant amount of funds and also materiel for tsunami victims throughout the Indian Ocean region. They are tremendous groups with tremendous volunteers who made a wonderfully important contribution.</para><para>Finally, the Clean Ocean Foundation, rather than raising funds for itself, used a public rally about the Gunnamatta outfall to raise funds for people in coastal villages who had hosted and taken care of surfers—because there is a common link—and they did a tremendous job in so doing. I want to thank not just these groups but also all the groups and individuals throughout the electorate of Flinders who have given generously and without hesitation. It is a wonderful example of community spirit. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indian Ocean: Tsunami</title><page.no>155</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>155</page.no><name role="metadata">Griffin, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GRIFFIN</name><name.id>VU5</name.id><electorate>Bruce</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also rise today to make some comments regarding the situation facing the international community and particular countries following the tsunami disaster. I will make some specific comments about the situation in Sri Lanka; however, I will begin in general terms. No-one could remain untouched by the tremendous devastation from the tsunami in a number of countries, particularly Indonesia but also Sri Lanka, India and Thailand, and in many other countries to a much smaller extent—though, nonetheless, for those communities there is still a sense of real devastation from what has occurred. People cannot fail to be touched by the work of the international community and of ordinary people throughout the world, particularly here in Australia. Australians have opened up their hearts and their pockets to provide support.</para></talk.start><para>I think it is also very proper to acknowledge that the efforts of the Australian government on behalf of the Australian community have been more than significant and are certainly to be commended as a real commitment to providing the necessary assistance to communities. It sets a benchmark for the future for dealing with international disasters, and I urge the government to maintain that sort of commitment to these sorts of problems. Hopefully, we will not face something of this nature again, but history tells us that we will.</para><para>Having made those points and commended the activities that the government has undertaken, particularly in relation to Indonesia, I would like to say a little about the situation in Sri Lanka. Many members, including the previous speaker, the member for Flinders, have expatriates of the Sri Lankan community living in their electorates. I certainly have a large expatriate Sri Lankan community in my electorate. It is a very diverse community. We often use that word `diverse' in this chamber, but in the context of the Sri Lankan community it most certainly is diverse. It has been defined to an extent by the civil war that has been going on in Sri Lanka for many years. Significant communities of Sinhalese, Tamils, Burghers and Muslims are all part of what makes up modern Sri Lanka.</para><para>In the context of what has occurred there in recent times, we are seeing a very desperate situation. It is a country with a population that is just under the population of Australia's, yet we are talking about over 31,000 people who have died. We are talking about nearly 80,000 families who have been displaced, and over half a million people have been involved in that. We are talking about over 320 camps that have been set up to deal with the issues being faced there. Certainly, there are problems that need to be dealt with by the Sri Lankan government and there are concerns that have to be dealt with by the community. I support all efforts that can be done to assist in Sri Lanka. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>South Australia: Bushfires</title><page.no>155</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>155</page.no><name role="metadata">Richardson, Kym, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RICHARDSON</name><name.id>E0B</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I rise to speak about an issue which is close to my heart—the tireless and ongoing work of emergency service personnel in a crisis. The day of Tuesday, 11 January will be a day forever etched in the minds of the residents of South Australia's Eyre Peninsula. It was on that day that South Australia suffered the worst and most devastating bushfire seen in the state since Ash Wednesday. Numerous lives were lost and thousands of hectares of land destroyed as the fire took very little time to ruin lives and livelihoods. One South Australian family battled to cope with the loss not only of their two children but of their grandmother as well. </para></talk.start><para>The tragedy and devastation of this crisis is undeniable and its impact far-reaching. But I stand before you today not to dwell on that sadness and tragedy but to present to you the amazing story of hope and inspiration that emerged from the disaster. That is the story of the South Australian volunteers who risked their lives and gave their time to rush to the aid of their fellow South Australians.</para><para>This tragic day saw 15 other difficult fires burning across South Australia and across thousands of hectares of South Australian country. Fire service volunteers from every corner of the state were involved in firefighting and behind the scenes service. Individuals joined to work as one team—farmers, private farm units, personnel from all emergency agencies, the metropolitan fire service, government departments and members of the community—to battle the crisis. These extraordinary people came together and worked tirelessly for one common goal—to serve and save their community.</para><para>Very rarely from a tragedy such as this can any positives be drawn, especially when human life is lost in a struggle against the elements. But from this tragedy comes an inspirational story. It is a story of mateship, hope and selflessness. It is a story of unity, commitment and determination. It is the story of the South Australian volunteer. South Australian volunteers placed their lives on the line on 11 January 2005, and they did so not to protect their own livelihoods or loved ones but to protect the lives and property of friends, neighbours and in some cases strangers for the one simple reason that these people needed their help. That help has continued beyond the battle to put out the fire and it will continue long after the clean-up is finished.</para><para>Aid organisations and a whole new band of volunteers have gone into the area to help those left to rebuild their lives. South Australians have again dug deep and donated anything they can spare to help in the rebuilding process. I stand before you today as a very proud South Australian, reflecting and acknowledging the people around us in times of tragedy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Past policies and programs constrain new departures and the inertia inherent in defending existing commitments is always a brake on progress. Nonetheless, an important test of a government's vitality is its ability to keep innovating.</para></talk.start><para>The Governor-General's speech and the policy substance of the election campaign demonstrate that the coalition is meeting this challenge across a wide band of areas. The foundation of this ability has been the strength of the Australian economy that has resulted from the coalition's stewardship. The Australian economy has been made into one of the world's strongest. The results of the economic reforms over the period of the Howard government are manifest: increased productivity and economic growth at a long-term average of 3.5 per cent per annum; the increase in the wealth and incomes of the Australian people; the fall in unemployment from 11 per cent to 5.1 per cent, the lowest level of unemployment since 1976; and inflation and interest rates have been kept low. This economic performance, produced by effective management, has given the government the capacity to innovate in positive and constructive ways in many areas. </para><para>When I was young I was struck by an academic paper with the title `Necessity is the mother of invention, or the devil makes work for idle hands: two theories of innovation'. In more prosaic terms the question posed was whether innovation was dictated by scarcity or liberated by plenty. As is usually the case with academic propositions, neither is entirely true. There is, to steal a phrase, a `third way'. Innovation is driven by both need and by opportunity. Under the Howard government effective economic management has meant that innovation to meet real needs has taken place amongst favourable settings. Scarcity ultimately cannot be banished; choices do have to be made between different needs. Overwhelmingly however, the coalition has been able to meet needs by creating a positive sum game. I want to exemplify this proposition by looking at two of the areas covered in the Governor-General's speech—Medicare and school education.</para><para>I take Medicare first. As I have said before, there is not much point in pretending that the coalition has always been wholeheartedly committed to Medicare or its precursor, Medibank. That is simply not the case. Many of us recollect, and some of us participated in, the constant change to Medibank under the Fraser government. During our opposition years promises were constantly made to fundamentally change the basic components of Medicare. This changed in the aftermath of Fightback when John Howard as Leader of the Opposition gave an unequivocal commitment that the coalition would fully retain the Medicare system. That commitment has been honoured and exceeded. Governments are never free of blemishes but I think it is a great tribute to the coalition that we eventually recognised one of the major Whitlam reforms and embraced it. The reality is that one of the Howard government's great success stories has been strengthening Medicare. It is the coalition government that has ensured the viability of Medicare.</para><para>The government has ensured that all Australians have improved access to affordable medical services. The centrepiece of the government's new Strengthening Medicare package is the safety net. This protects individuals and families often coping with chronic illness or injury who confront significant out-of-pocket medical costs. In my electorate of Kooyong alone some 6,500 people benefited from the safety net in the first three months of its operation.</para><para>The government has also moved to underpin and expand the rate of bulk-billing in Australia. It did so prior to the election and during the campaign when it announced the introduction of the 100 per cent Medicare measure. From 1 January 2005 the Medicare benefits schedule now pays 100 per cent rebate on scheduled fees for unreferred GP visits. The high level of reimbursement applies to all unreferred GP visits not just bulk-billed consultations, as Labor proposed. The national bulk-billing rate has risen by 5.3 percentage points, or eight per cent in relative terms, since the Strengthening Medicare package was announced. The national bulk-billing rate for Australians aged 65 or older is even higher. In that age category 82.1 per cent of all medical consultations are now bulk-billed. </para><para>The question of philosophy lies at the heart of any debate about health policy, and I am afraid that I have to say that Labor has a very blinkered view about health and, in particular, the role of the private sector in delivering what is a quality health care system by any international standard. Fortunately, the government has come to understand that a public and private sector mix and balance is essential to the delivery of quality health and education services in this country. Lifetime Health Cover and a 30 per cent private health insurance rebate have relieved pressure on public hospitals and improved access for people who do not have private health insurance. It has enhanced the likelihood of early and appropriate hospitalisation whenever and wherever it is required. The interests of all Australians are best served when we have viable, efficient and successful private, as well as public, hospitals.</para><para>There must be a commitment to support those Australians who make the sacrifice to take out and maintain private health insurance, and optimise their treatment options. The government's 30 per cent private health insurance rebate does support these Australians and, during the course of the election campaign, the government announced a plan to increase that rebate to 35 per cent for Australians aged 65 and 40 per cent for Australians aged 70 years or older. I look forward to that change coming into operation in April following the passage of the enabling legislation, which is scheduled for debate today.</para><para>Finally, I am pleased that this government has directed attention, planning and resources to some of the unsung areas of need in our community—to the problems of mental health and dementia. The government will invest $110 million in mental health and ensure that Australians with mental health problems receive effective care. This government can be rightly proud of its achievements across a broad spectrum of policies and programs and health is a perfect illustration of that position.</para><para>I would like to take a few minutes now to mention the very significant steps that the government has taken and will continue to take in the area of education. The Howard government is committed to providing record sums of money to the nation's schools. Over the coming four-year period, 2005 to 2008, the government has allocated $33 billion for schools education. This includes $10.8 billion supplementary funding for state schools, $12.8 billion general recurrent funding for Catholic schools and $7.8 billion for independent schools. Funding for all non-government schools in Australia will in future be based on the socioeconomic status funding model which means that every non-government school will receive funding based on the same transparent and objective funding formula, based on independent data, consistent for all schools.</para><para>It is one of the government objectives in adopting this funding model that private investment in education in Australia should not be discouraged and therefore the model does not take into account a school's private income from fees or other resources, or its assets. Rather, the level of government support to each of the children in any given non-government school is determined by reference to the socioeconomic status of the families in the areas from which the students at that school are drawn. This is in stark contrast to the plans that the Labor Party had in store for non-government schools—which I do not think have been revised—should it have been elected on 9 October. The Labor Party planned to slash the funding of 67 schools in Victoria and New South Wales by $520 million over the next four years. Thirty-two of those schools are in Victoria and seven were in my electorate of Kooyong. Another five Kooyong schools would have had their funding capped at the present level. This would have affected over 13,500 students, almost half the number of students who attend school in my electorate and would have resulted in a loss of $40 million of funding over the next four years for the schools which were targeted. </para><para>I am proud to be a product of the government school system and I am fully supportive of that system. I was very proud when the Prime Minister announced, as part of the current funding commitment to school education in Australia, a further $1 billion to support infrastructure needs, libraries, computers et cetera at government and under resourced non-government schools. I believe this is innovation at its best, which is permitted by a strong and growing economy.</para><para>As I have said, innovation and change are important. I want to raise one area where I believe innovation and change are necessary and possible, and that is in the area of refugees and asylum seekers. Our policies towards asylum seekers were premised on concern about vast numbers of undeserving and potentially dangerous people landing on our shores. Today, unauthorised boat arrivals have all but ceased and the great majority of people they carried have turned out to be genuine refugees. There were no terrorists hiding amongst the asylum seekers. Globally the number of refugees has nearly halved during the last decade. Of particular significance to Australia is the fact that refugees have stopped flowing from Afghanistan and Iraq, two of the main source countries of asylum seekers coming here without visas.</para><para>If a crisis situation justifies severe measures and the crisis passes, on what basis can the severe measures be perpetuated? In brief, I believe that we need to release asylum seekers in detention, of whom there are only a couple of hundred, who have passed health and security checks and place them in the community until their applications have been processed. I believe that thousands of genuine refugees who have temporary protection visas should be given permanent residence in a one-off amnesty. But today I want to focus, albeit briefly, on the policy of indefinite detention. The average prison sentence for people convicted of rape and other sexual crimes in Victoria and New South Wales is just over four years and it is between two and three years for offenders guilty of robbery, abduction or kidnapping. In Australia's immigration detention centres there are people who have been locked up for more than four years, the longest being for more than six years. These people are detained indefinitely, potentially for life, because they have been found to be ineligible for an Australian visa and we cannot find another country to accept them.</para><para>In the US the nation's courts have recently drawn upon the bill of rights in the constitution to question the government assertion of complete authority to indefinitely detain immigrants who cannot be deported. The Australian Constitution has fewer provisions for the protection of human rights. In 2004, by a 4-3 majority, the High Court decided that the government had the legal power to indefinitely detain people it wished to deport even if it is in practice impossible to deport them. In the relevant case, Al-Kateb v Godwin, Mr Justice McHugh, one of the majority, said:</para><quote><para>As long as the detention is for the purpose of deportation or preventing aliens from entering Australia or the Australian community, the justice or wisdom of the course taken by the Parliament is not examinable in this or any other domestic court. It is not for courts, exercising federal jurisdiction, to determine whether the course taken by Parliament is unjust or contrary to basic human rights. </para></quote><para>The result of this policy is illustrated by Mohammed, or Peter, Qasim, who has spent more than six years in immigration detention and may be imprisoned for life. Mr Qasim and the department of immigration disagree about some of the circumstances of his situation. But what is beyond doubt is that Mr Qasim is not detained because he has been charged or convicted of any crime, nor is he suspected of terrorism nor is he in any respect alleged to constitute a danger to the Australian community. Mr Qasim has been detained for a period longer than the average sentence of imprisonment for robbers and rapists because he is ineligible for an Australian visa and we cannot find another country to take him. To put it simply, I believe that the policy of indefinite detention of people who have committed no crime—and I think this is a position actually supported by both sides of the parliament—and who pose no threat to the Australian community should not be sustained.</para><para>I would like to conclude by acknowledging the work of my many loyal supporters in Kooyong who have contributed time and effort year after year to my re-election campaign. I owe much to the chairman of my electorate council, Bill Clancy, and to his vice-chairman, Paul Davey, who filled in at the last minute so effectively during the conduct of my campaign. I say a heartfelt thank you to them, the team of volunteers—who organised fundraising events, who walked with me in all weather through the streets of the electorate and who dropped pamphlets in letterboxes—and all those Liberal Party members and friends who manned the polling booths on election day and during the pre-poll periods and visited so many hospitals and nursing homes and risked everything by displaying my posters on their front gardens, astonishingly attractive though they were. My staff deserve particular mention, and I am always grateful to them.</para><para>I am pleased to be back in this place and I recommit myself to serving the people of Kooyong and this parliament. I would like to welcome the new MPs from Victoria: Russell Broadbent, who had the only victory in a Labor seat in Victoria—and it is really good to see Russell back again—Andrew Robb and Jason Wood. I would also like to say farewell to Bob Charles and David Kemp, who served the government and the parliament well. I would like to congratulate Senator Judith Troeth, who had a stunning and deserved victory in the doubtful third Senate position in Victoria.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>160</page.no><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GRIERSON</name><name.id>00AMP</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The address-in-reply affords us the opportunity to reflect on the election of the 41st Parliament of Australia. Like my Labor colleagues, I am disappointed not to be in government and not to have the opportunity to deliver for my electorate of Newcastle policies that would have united us under shared opportunity, policies that would have encouraged individual and community achievement to prosper our collective economic fortunes, and policies that would have promoted our safety and security and restored our international reputation as a nation that uses its capacity to aid global harmony and prosperity. But that is not to be.</para></talk.start><para>In his election victory speech, the Prime Minister committed to govern for all Australians. The people of Newcastle intend to hold him to account for that pledge and we look forward to benefiting fairly from the Prime Minister's commitment over the next three years. Novocastrians too made a choice in that election. They registered their strong support for Labor's agenda, and for that I sincerely thank them. In fact, I am wonderfully proud that the people of Newcastle exercised their vote to deliver me the greatest pro-Labor swing in the country. I am the first to acknowledge that I represent the best electorate in Australia, where people vote not just for the good of themselves but also for the good of their community. In Newcastle we have a saying that there is only half a degree of separation between us. We know each other well because we band together in our neighbourhoods, our community and sporting clubs, our volunteer organisations and through those marvellous networks and associations built up over time, living lives that value the place we live in and the people who live there. It is a place where people still smile and talk to strangers, where generosity abounds and where pride and encouragement are extended to everyone who has a go. </para><para>Labor's election agenda was so strongly supported by Novocastrians because it offered shared economic progress and success. In Newcastle, that agenda would have seen $20 million in funding for our Energy Australia Stadium, the home of the Knights and Newcastle United Jets football teams, but also the home of parochial pride and celebration. Unfortunately the Prime Minister offered no contribution to this project which would have allowed our city to better compete for international sporting and entertainment events and gain the economic and employment benefits of increased tourism. I encourage the Prime Minister to have a fresh look at this issue, with a view to facilitating growth in regional economies—forming genuine regional partnerships in all regional economies and not just in seats the coalition holds or wishes to hold at elections.</para><para>Newcastle voters also favoured Labor's commitment to restore regional status to our university—something we sorely miss. It is important to understand that in regions universities are very special places. Unlike the sandstone universities, regional universities depend on good regional partnerships for their success, and regions depend on universities for their success as well. In this partnership, research and entrepreneurship are facilitated, student needs are understood and responded to locally, sponsorship is assisted and the purpose of the university is embedded within the community. The Department of Education, Science and Training recently sponsored a regional engagement forum at our university, which suggests that they see it as a regional university. It is logical, then, that the outcomes and strategies from that forum could best be enacted if regional status and attached funding were available in 2005, particularly when our outstanding research record is viewed against regional business linkages. Minister Nelson, we would welcome your sensible intervention to reinstate regional status to the University of Newcastle.</para><para>Labor's election commitment to provide 40 additional medical places at the University of Newcastle to respond to the GP shortage in our region was also understood and appreciated by the voters of Newcastle. As our university specialises in training GPs, it could accommodate those places instantly. As doctors who train in regional universities generally end up practising in the regions, this would benefit electorates, both Labor and coalition, throughout the Hunter, New England, Central Coast and North Coast regions. Given the attrition rate of GPs in regional Australia, I again urge Minister Nelson and Minister Abbott to confer and bring additional places on line at the University of Newcastle with some urgency. Additional places in central Sydney do not make much sense, given that the majority of medical work force shortages are in regional Australia.</para><para>Providing after-hours GP services was also a Labor priority, with a commitment given by our shadow minister for health to maintain funding at current levels to our highly successful GP access after-hours service. This service originated in the Hunter and its trial and expansion was supported by the coalition. That was welcomed by all of us. In fact, this excellent model has become the benchmark for similar services around the country. However, Minister Abbott was dragged screaming and kicking to support ongoing funding by the hard work of the people of the Hunter and Newcastle who made it clear, through media, letters and petitions of support, that they expected any government, Labor or Liberal, to fund what works and works well to manage the emergency health care of communities. So we look forward to adequate and continuing funding to the Hunter GP access after-hours service. </para><para>This week already we have heard much about the national skills shortage crisis. The Reserve Bank of Australia have identified it as a major factor in restraining our export performance, particularly in non-commodity exports such as manufacturing. In Newcastle we have been trying to tell the government about the skills shortage for quite a long time. In fact, the millennium skills report prepared some years ago by our region pointed to this looming shortage, but unfortunately this was not responded to by the Howard government. In the election Labor well understood the need to overcome the skills shortage in Newcastle and the Hunter. Labor's commitment to providing special skill-up and youth link-up initiatives in our region appealed to our community, ever concerned for the future of our young people, who continue to face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country. Special support is needed to increase school retention rates and to use the talents of our youth to the best advantage for this nation's productivity. In Newcastle we would welcome a hand up for our young people from this government.</para><para>Unfortunately, it seems that all the government has offered is a new technical college for regions with skill shortages. As a former principal I have some major problems with this initiative on several grounds, but particularly because it ignores existing initiatives by TAFEs and schools to advance vocational education in collaboration with local industry, according to local needs. It is already happening in prosperous regions, in regions that are willing to find their own solutions. For example, in my region a highly successful call centre training program was initiated in response to growing industry demand. Similarly, hospitality partnerships have also been successful in overcoming skill deficiencies. In the traditional trades areas, where there is a major gap, our local group training companies have had some outstanding successes through their partnerships with industry and TAFEs. If government had listened to them, and responded to their advice earlier, then we would not have had the skills crisis that currently hampers growth and compounds our current account deficit. But the political reality is that the Howard government has neglected the great manufacturing regions like Newcastle and the Hunter. We would wonder whether there is a selective disregard for Labor held areas. Only now that we have the largest current account deficit in the nation's history is the government taking notice.</para><para>As for the new technical colleges, I applaud the local solution being put forward by HunterNet—the manufacturing industry cluster group—the Hunter Institute of TAFE and the Australian Industry Group in my electorate to work in partnership with local schools to deliver this program. It is a model they are putting forward to the government in response to their request to get these colleges going. Only local approaches with efficient use of existing local resources will be able to adequately respond to resolving the skills shortages. But, at best, this solution, with only 300 students catered for, will be only a token measure given the scale of the problem. </para><para>Affordable child care and predictable financial support when raising children were seen as vital to the economic prosperity of Newcastle families. They are right. Data released recently shows that fertility decline in the regions is five times greater than the average across the state of New South Wales. That should be worrying to all members of parliament. Does that mean the end of rural communities? I repeat: the rate of fertility decline in the regions is five times greater than the state average. Voters supported policies that increased resources to child-care centres and recognised the need for child-care workers to be trained and rewarded. They rejected the taxation concession approach put forward by the government that meant the more you paid for child care the more you could claim on your tax return. Again, that is another selective policy that favours those on highest incomes. I thank Sharan Burrow from the ACTU for supporting this social area of need, and certainly for supporting my campaign in Newcastle.</para><para>When it comes to taxation and incomes, Newcastle voters did not forget that in Peter Costello's last budget he chose to overlook 90 per cent of them—those people who actually earn less than $52,000 per year. I do not think that those of us on comfortable salaries look around enough and see how much ordinary Australians earn. Perhaps low-wage earners have not forgotten just how hard the government resisted increases to the minimum wage over the past three years.</para><para>Had Labor been elected, 64 out of 65 schools in my electorate, be they public or private, would have received more funding, and more students seeking places at TAFE and university would have gained entry because of Labor's increase in funded places. We would also have seen the 25 per cent HECS hike removed, and perhaps our university would have not faced reduced enrolments this year—what has turned out to be a national trend, predicted by Labor. If you are going to keep burdening young people they will turn away. That is exactly what has happened. They have turned away from the economic burden of being a tertiary student under a government that increases the user pays approach to gaining higher education in what we like to call `the clever country'.</para><para>Newcastle's support for Labor's health policies, supporting Medicare Gold and retaining bulk-billing, remained as strong as ever. We have a proud public health tradition in Newcastle and the Hunter, and we understand the economic health and social dividends that result from investing more into the public health system. Sadly, only in the last few weeks, another GP has closed his doors in my electorate. I say `sadly' because this GP faces a health crisis of his own. He is only a young man and it is going to be a very difficult time for him. He had to abandon his practice; he could not find a locum. He could not find any GP to take it over. Why was that? Because he bulk-bills. It is a bulk-billing practice with a mostly aged population. That is just tragic. What does it say about the success of Minister Abbott's rescue efforts for Medicare? Just more failure and more distress to an overworked profession and to their patients. It remains the biggest shame in this nation that we cannot provide GP services to all Australians.</para><para>I have now fought two election campaigns in which I have been the candidate. Having been a member of the Labor Party for well over 25 years, I can say that it is certainly different when you are the candidate. In the first campaign, in 2001, I benefited a great deal from Newcastle's traditional support for Labor and from the good efforts of my predecessor, Allan Morris. But this campaign was one where, even though national issues and campaign tactics had a major influence, there was an element of appraisal of my own performance. That can be very challenging. But I was a very fortunate candidate to have had the support of so many Labor members and friends, not to mention a wonderful family and staff. They are too numerous to name individually, but I wish to formally thank my entire campaign team and all volunteers who supported our belief and determination to provide a better government. </para><para>I also thank my caucus executive colleagues and our national campaign directorate for their support of my campaign. They were very obliging in visiting Newcastle, listening to the people and developing policy that really responded to Newcastle's needs. They genuinely understood those needs and did their best to incorporate that into policy and election activities. I again pledge my devoted service to the people of Newcastle and give my assurance that, while ever I hold the seat, the government will be well aware of our needs and reminded of our contribution to this great country. I also assure the people of Newcastle that under my representation Labor will never be able to take them for granted nor will they ever be able to take for granted the loyal support that Newcastle has shown to Labor for 104 years.</para><para>Election campaigns also bring sadness and regret. The results can show a randomness that sees talented people of compassion and dedication leave this place. For Labor, we lost some wonderful caucus colleagues, and I particularly pay tribute to my friend Sharryn Jackson, the former member for Hasluck, who constantly inspired me—I do miss her—with her love for her electorate and her constant championing of their concerns. She is sorely missed.</para><para>Since the election there have been other losses too, in particular for Labor the loss of our former leader Mark Latham due to ill health. I express on the public record my gratitude and respect for his efforts to provide a real alternative for the Australian people. Mark was a man of big ideas and bold visions, but he was also a man with the common touch who valued the contributions of all Australians. His pride in this country and his passionate belief in Labor's principles were evident for everyone to see. He saw a wonderful link between Labor's policies and the strength and goodness of the Australian people—a link I know he wished to nourish and sustain with policies that he believed would lead to greater prosperity, security and national achievement within a social framework that valued the spirit of fairness and generosity to others. He also is missed. I extend my gratitude and best wishes to Mark, particularly for the challenges he faces with his health. I thank him very much for his dedication to Labor.</para><para>The leadership baton for Labor now rests with Kim Beazley. I am not quite sure if Kim will return as patron to the Knights and be seen running up Red Hill in his Knights jersey but I know that, like the Knights, our local football heroes, he is hungry for victory in our political version of the grand final. I am proud and privileged to once more be part of this parliament and I am proud and privileged to be part of the Labor opposition leader's quest for government of this great nation. We are a great nation with a great spirit.</para><para>I pay tribute to the overwhelming generosity displayed by Australians to our neighbours in the tragic aftermath of the tsunami. It showed that we have a commitment to helping others. We have a collective strength in that way. Australians have matured to the point where we now see our neighbours in a more global sense. We know that part of the responsibility of living in the lucky country is giving aid and comfort to our regional neighbours. The majority of financial aid that leaves these shores in normal times comes from the pockets of ordinary Australians. We truly are generous and caring. </para><para>I want to draw attention to comments by a young doctor. I tried to find his name, but I have not been successful. He was awarded an Australia Day national honour for his assistance as part of medical teams who treated the victims of the Bali bombings. In his interview he said something very special. He said that he had been humbled by the experience of treating Australians. He said that, to a man and woman at that time, everyone he treated told him to help another person first, as that person's need was greater than their own. In my role as a parliamentarian I have learnt that the greatest inspiration comes from the extraordinary feats of ordinary Australians.</para><para>Sadly, in my electorate we recently saw the worst of the human spirit, when a small group of racists sought to vilify our new Sudanese residence. Newcastle has almost 500 Sudanese refugees who have been sponsored by the Newcastle community. In response to this attack by a few—I think dangerous—people, Newcastle rose up and supported our Sudanese community and celebrated our multicultural diversity. It will live with me for a long time that 600 people came together in a massive celebration. Having just heard the member for Kooyong talk about Qasim, who has been in a detention centre here for over six years, I can only say that it was very sad to hear a Sudanese man of approximately 40 years of age say that he was born in a refugee camp, that he had lived his entire life in a refugee camp and that his children were born in a refugee camp. It is wonderful that we can offer these people some hope. The celebration was a very moving experience, and I pay tribute to the people of Newcastle. It is a privilege to represent them.</para><para>In conclusion, I want to raise a sensitive matter. I have a great deal of respect and appreciation for the professional way in which the staff in Parliament House—political, electorate and parliamentary—support the government of this country. However, in the past three years I have been alarmed at times by the treatment of interjectors in the public gallery. Although this is an infrequent occurrence, on too many occasions the response to interjectors has in my view been excessively physical. On those particular occasions no warning appeared to have been given. No attempts seem to have been made to explain the consequences or actions that would have to be taken to remove the person from the gallery. Unfortunately, at times the force applied seemed excessive relative to the actions of those causing the problem and to the restraining power needed to escort the offenders from the gallery.</para><para>As a member of parliament I am always grateful for the vigilance of our security personnel and acknowledge that they are placed in the front line of potential risk and, consequently, do respond with the thoughts of possible worst-case scenarios uppermost in their minds. But this remains the people's house and, as we watch those walls being built around our perimeters, we have a responsibility to ensure that Australia's democracy is visible and accessible to the people we represent. It is therefore essential that our security staff members are each given the best training possible to respond to critical incidents appropriately. I urge attention to this matter by those charged with this responsibility. We are fortunate in this House to have an open, inclusive government. It must continue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>165</page.no><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name><name.id>CK6</name.id><electorate>Moreton</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Vocational and Technical Education and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am greatly honoured to be able to stand here as the member for Moreton and to reaffirm the commitment I have made on each occasion, at the commencement of the now four parliaments to which I have been elected, to maintain my focus, my attention, on matters within my electorate as my first call of duty. My Moreton-centric rallying cry of 1996 I have attempted to maintain to the best of my human possibilities and personal energies. It has been 34 years since my family moved into what is the federal electorate of Moreton in the Sunnybank area. The footprints of my family's efforts have perhaps not been anything out of the ordinary but, rather, part of the local community, working through P&amp;Cs and my parents Doug and Hazel, the Lions Club of Brisbane Macgregor and other organisations. This set in train an approach which I will continue to attempt to fulfil in these next three years. </para></talk.start><para>Having been a student of Runcorn State School and Macgregor High School and, in more recent years, Griffith University, where I completed part-time studies, knowing that each of those institutions is within the electorate that I represent is an enormous point of anchoring for me to keep reality in check. I am always conscious that people are never afraid to walk up to me in local shopping centres and at community events and remind me that I attended school with them, their daughter, their son or, in more recent years, their parents. As a local lad I am very greatly honoured to be in this place to do my best to represent the views and concerns of the good people of this part of Australia.</para><para>I want to briefly report upon the 2004 election campaign and work my way through a number of issues that are of importance to the local electorate. The No. 1 issue in my electorate was very clearly a lack of faith in the alternative that was presented. Economic management was a point of reckoning for people. Interest rates became an example to people, particularly in those fast-developing suburbs of Calamvale, Parkinson and Drewvale and through Eight Mile Plains, Runcorn, Stretton and Sunnybank Hills. In those suburbs, where people have invested in themselves and their families, people were very—and rightly—concerned about the lack of clarity, the lack of ability and the lack of experience that was being offered by the alternative. They spoke very loudly and very strongly in that regard. People were saying to me that clearly the Australian Labor Party are not the party that they had once voted for and that they do not represent real people any more. There is an enormous amount of work that those opposite have got to do. They have to look within themselves to realise that they are the custodians of what is now a failed party that has a lot of work to do to try to restore some sense of faith in average Australians. I am sure that they will do that and I guess, from the point of view of a solid political debate, one would hope they get on with that task.</para><para>I had people say to me that they had concerns about some aspects of the tough decisions the government made. At Calamvale College one man said, `I wasn't happy over the war in Iraq, but I do not trust and do not believe the Australian Labor Party can properly represent me or, indeed, would be a safe bet for this country, so I am voting for you.' I thank that gentleman, because I think it is important that people do express those sorts of views in that sort of way. It is a positive gesture from that man, whose name I do not know, but I was very pleased to receive his support last October.</para><para>But the key issues, apart from the Australian Labor Party and people's genuine concerns, were the infrastructure and transport issues in my electorate. The Australian Labor Party promised a quick pot of money to try to deal with some of these issues. There was no plan that underpinned it, though. Labor essentially wanted and still want—I noticed the member for Wills, the Labor Party spokesman on these things, in the House yesterday—to put more trucks through my local area. They actually want to direct more interstate trucks down the Brisbane Urban Corridor, which is Kessels Road in my electorate. The alternative that the Howard government has planned is the AusLink proposal. It is a way around this important issue, and now even the Queensland government are acknowledging that AusLink has something to offer. </para><para>The Queensland transport minister, Paul Lucas, understands my passion. He campaigned against me in the last election. He and I have traded a few blows over the past 12 months, but I have to say to you that I have had meetings with Paul Lucas and I am very satisfied that, since the election, he knows that people want an end to the sense of jurisdictional battles on these issues. I applaud his commitment, along with that of Minister Jim Lloyd and, before him, Minister Ian Campbell, in dealing with these issues in a proper, planned and coordinated way. I do not apologise to Paul Lucas for standing up strongly to him on behalf of my constituents. I can assure him and the House that I have given stick where needed to my ministerial colleagues for exactly the same reason—and I certainly will not stop doing that.</para><para>So what have we done? The Australian government are now financing a removal of the toll on the Southern Brisbane Bypass at night. They are doing that because 40 per cent of the trucks that go through my electorate would use the alternative if the toll was not there, and we want to get some real data. The Queensland government are now cooperating and taking the million or so dollars that we are putting on the table for this. That toll trial will start at the end of this month of February. This is fantastic news.</para><para>There is more that I want. I want to see the Persse Road toll plaza taken out completely. This toll plaza impedes the good progress and the good use of local road assets. We see too many cars on Gowan Road through Stretton and Calamvale as people from south of my electorate motor around that toll plaza and go up Warrigal Road at Eight Mile Plains and Runcorn. I want to see an end to that and I have spoken to Paul Lucas about this. We are in the business of working together. The Queensland government are making a contribution as well. I acknowledge that a numberplate recognition technology being installed now along the Kessels Road corridor will mean that trucks that are using this road instead of using the toll road in the toll-free trial period will be asked why they are there. Their numberplate will be photographed and the driver will be followed up—I see no problems with that.</para><para>I have to say to those who have listened to my comments in this place and publicly over the last eight years on this subject that my consistent approach has now been vindicated both by the Australian government's AusLink plan and by the cooperative actions of the Queensland government. I welcome that.</para><para>There is also a federal and state feasibility study to look at the engineering solutions for the Kessels-Mains roads bottleneck, and I welcome that. But again we saw yesterday that the Australian Labor Party have learnt absolutely nothing from the federal election campaign, because the Labor Party are still saying, `No, let's just dig the ditch; let's put the overpass in.' That is a signal for more trucks through my electorate. I will not stand idly by and allow the Labor Party to put more trucks through my area. We need a proper plan. There is no need to build that overpass until we know that the big trucks are off the local roads. The overpass can come but not before the trucks are gone.</para><para>Then there is the overpass that is needed on Beaudesert Road at Acacia Ridge to replace the level crossing on the Sydney-Brisbane rail line. Beaudesert Road is a state road, the rail line is in fact owned by the Queensland government, and yet Queensland state members and the federal Labor Party are saying the federal government should build this overpass. I say we would if the state government would cooperate with the Australian government's AusLink proposal and lease that rail line from Brisbane to the border. We are trying to bring the Brisbane freight equation into the 21st century and provide a rail line that actually works on 21st-century standards. The New South Wales government has signed up on the Sydney-Brisbane rail plan, but the 130 kilometres from the Queensland border to Brisbane is going to wallow in early 20th-century technology at best unless we get the progress that we are calling for. I am hoping that, in the spirit of cooperation that now seems to be there from the Queensland government, Minister Lucas and Minister Anderson will get a satisfactory result. That last 130 kilometres needs to be in that form of agreement because then, under AusLink, we will plan and build infrastructure improvements, including that overpass at Acacia Ridge. </para><para>As the local federal member and as a long-term resident I have always supported the use of that rail corridor—which is only used for that interstate rail operation—as an extension of the Brisbane city rail service. It is outrageous to think that, in 2005, suburbs like Algester, Calamvale and Parkinson and, indeed, places as far south as the electorate of my colleague from Forde are not served by a rail system. It is one of the reasons why local roads in my electorate are being choked with cars, because people are in cars rather than on trains. Those are big-ticket items. They have been part of my efforts over the last eight years or so since being elected as the federal member in this place and they will continue to be part of my activity until we get the results that local people expect of me.</para><para>My electorate is now the most culturally diverse electorate in the entire state of Queensland. My previous portfolio of Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs meant that I learnt a lot from my local community which I could then use, not by way of judgment, but as a point of comparison with the conduct of communities in other places. My community has lots of people from lots of places. It means that while we are a fairly small pond by comparison with places in Western Sydney we, nevertheless, are a very happy pond.</para><para>We will, as is always the case, have infectious Chinese New Year events. We have already been to a couple. They will happen all through this week, and probably this month, throughout my electorate. Many of the local Islamic community have come from places like South Africa and Zimbabwe. They are professional people who have brought enormous skills; 96 per cent of the Muslims who have come from South Africa and Zimbabwe to Queensland have come as business migrants. They have brought investment opportunities and skills.</para><para>In the last few weeks they have been involved in the business of raising enormous amounts of money for the tsunami appeal. I was pleased to attend a function which, with other efforts raising funds from local mosques, pulled together some $200,000. Last weekend we saw children on a walkathon. It was kids for kids, raising funds under the organisational auspices of Crescents of Brisbane, getting kids to understand that they can make a difference. These are great examples of a local community digging deep and doing good things. It is also a good testimony of a community, particularly the Islamic community, that has had a difficult time in recent years. It has affected me as a person. It has affected my conduct as a member of parliament. I am very, very proud to know these people.</para><para>We also have many people who are new to Australia and have come from the Horn of Africa—from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia. An enormous number of people have come from Sudan. We know that they are there because the <inline font-style="italic">Courier Mail</inline> discovered that in the last seven days. I have talked proudly about these people wherever I have gone around the country and will continue to do so. They are people who understand what it is like to have nothing. When they come to a country like Australia—where freedom is a given and where liberty, the right to do everything that is permitted by law, is something they have never known before they have come to this place—it really reminds us about exactly who we are and where we come from. I am very proud to be part of the Liberal Party of Australia, which, from the founder on, has always said that no racial or religious caveat applies to its sense of respect for the rights of an individual. I am pleased to maintain that approach. </para><para>One of the ways in which we have been able to bring citizens of long standing and citizens of new standing together has been through the infection of locally based community citizenship ceremonies. On Australia Day this year I was pleased to preside on behalf of Peter McGauran, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, at the first ever university based citizenship ceremony, at Griffith University. I praise the Griffith University Lions Club for their efforts in convening it. The Brisbane Macgregor Lions Club, whose community service knows no bounds, sponsored the event at Macgregor state primary school hall. On that day there were also the Moreton community awards—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Hatton)</inline>—Does the honourable member seek to intervene?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Danby</name></talker><para>—I do.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name></talker><para>—I would like to continue my speech on behalf of my electorate.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The intervention is declined.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name></talker><para>—I would like the member for Melbourne Ports to take it up at another time.

Ivan drove Iris to every event. He was rightly awarded. John Allen, of Ekibin Lions Club, who lives at Yeronga, has had 16 years involvement there fundraising in every possible way. He was a torchbearer for the Sydney Olympics. John Allen has always made it possible for young people to see the uniform he walked in and the torch he carried.</para></talk.start></continue><para>John Corless, of Yeronga, is perhaps an unsung hero of the Australian Football League in Queensland, in that he has been dedicated to this sport and its development through local schools such as Yeronga state school. He has been President of Yeronga AFL since 1991. Melvena Hallam, of Algester, has for eight years worked without fail for three days a week at the Veterans Support and Advocacy Service. Wally Sefjack, of Macgregor, is a US-born citizen who has love and passion for a sense of good citizenry in Australia. His involvement through the Sunnybank RSL rightly afforded him this sort of note in dispatch. It was a very emotional moment. There were many members from the local QE2 hospital auxiliary—people who have made such a difference in that organisation, which has raised over $1.4 million over the past 20 years.</para><para>Perhaps the most emotional award went to Mrs Barbara Saranin, who accepted the award on behalf of her late husband, Alex. Alex Saranin was Russian born and came to Australia via Shanghai. His story—the things he and his family went through, both in Russia and in China, in their escape to this country in the post-Communist revolution era—and his application and effort in our local community were very inspiring. He wrote a book which he has handed on to others to read—a book which I would certainly endorse to all others. His local Nathan Neighbourhood Watch group, who do so much good community work, humbled and honoured him when they named their good neighbour award after him. </para><para>Speaking of Neighbourhood Watch, we continue to have a very strong, effective and capable community response where people are adding to the thin blue line of policing, working in partnership with the local police service to make a difference. I am very proud to offer support to each of them. In places like Algester and Calamvale, which are new to my electorate, I have been happy to engage in their activities. At Stretton they run a wonderful barbecue and picnic event each year that brings the community together. It is great to see, as well as those activities in longer established areas such as Chelmer, Graceville, Sherwood, Tennyson, Yeronga and Moorooka.</para><para>I was very pleased to see a constituent of mine Jenny Bobeszko, who was the chairperson of the Brisbane South regional support group, was noted at the state Neighbourhood Watch rally held on election day last year as the regional community member of the year award recipient. I think it is right that we acknowledge her leadership and her involvement.</para><para>In the years ahead one of the new portfolio challenges is the important area of ensuring that young people feel empowered by the choices they make through their schooling lives and are able to progress in a positive and constructive way from their schooldays to their work days through further opportunities in apprenticeships in the trade skills. My local electorate actually offers me an enormous amount of instruction on this as well.</para><para>In my electorate there are long-established partnerships between business and high schools, which will continue to have an impact on the conduct in my new portfolio responsibilities. The Southside Cluster Industry Placement Scheme, the SCIPS program, chaired by Cameron Innes and so well administered by Carmel Dalton, involves schools in and around my electorate, including Clairvaux MacKillop College, Yeronga State High School, Our Lady's College at Annerley, Runcorn State High School and Holland Park High School. They also provide a pay-as-you-use service to Macgregor State High School.</para><para>They have over 700 students involved in 1,200 placements—some students are sent out more than once. It is a good scheme. It shows you that the local community in my electorate took up the challenges issued by the federal government in about 1997 and indeed by the short-lived state coalition government of that era to engage in these sorts of programs. It is not well understood that of the school based new apprentices around the country over half of them are in Queensland, which is an indictment of states like New South Wales and Victoria especially. Over half of them are in Queensland, but unfortunately not enough of them are in the traditional trades.</para><para>I pay tribute to former minister Dr Kemp, who set in train these sorts of structures, and to former ministers in that short-lived coalition government—the now Liberal leader, Bob Quinn, and now Liberal senator for Queensland, Santo Santoro. They were ministers for education and training at a time when these new structures came into place. The maturity of those in Queensland, particularly in my electorate, set me some very good examples to look for in other places. </para><para>I thank the Liberal Party division of Moreton for their faith in me as their candidate, now on four occasions. I promise to continue to work hard for all involved.

I want to record my thanks to the people of the electorate of Canberra for placing their trust in me as their federal representative.</para></talk.start><para>The result we received in this electorate, with an increase in the primary vote, could not have been achieved without the hard work and assistance of many people. There is my staff—Kathryn, Chris, Daniel, Rose, Shaun and Helen—who face the daily challenges with me and who display great loyalty not only to me but to our supporters and, most importantly, to our community. There are all those wonderful people in the local Australian Labor Party who had to face two elections within seven days, yet were willing and able to get out and work so hard to ensure our local success. There are also all the volunteers who phoned or called in to offer their help. My sincere thanks to each one of you. In my role as a shadow minister it is difficult, given the level of resources available to us in opposition. However, I thank Victoria, who worked long and hard with me last term in our two areas of responsibility—namely, ageing and seniors, and disabilities.</para><para>I am extremely proud to represent the community of Canberra—an electorate with an electoral enrolment of 109,476 voters at the time of the election. Our community is no different to any other in Australia. We share similar aspirations and hopes. We have similar concerns and stresses. We are very resilient, ready to support each other through those unexpected challenges. The devastating fires of January 2003 certainly displayed that characteristic. Some commentators observed that this showed that Canberra really did have a heart. We reckon they never really knew us and that that heart was always evident. </para><para>It seems appropriate that the seat of Canberra—in the Australian Capital Territory, which was created specifically to hold the government of this country—can claim connections to so many other towns, cities and nations. At the last census 17,664 people who were born in Europe lived in the seat of Canberra. There were 7,252 people from Asia, 933 from subSaharan Africa, and 871 from North Africa and the Middle East. Just over 24 per cent of my constituents—a bit over 37,000 people—were born overseas and now call the seat of Canberra home. Whether we were born in Woden, Wangaratta or Western Samoa, we are all Canberrans and very proud of our city. We happen to live in the nation's capital, of which we are all extremely proud. It is a beautiful city with a special role, and we all take our part in that role very seriously.</para><para>I am also pleased to have the opportunity to reflect on a couple of issues that I see as important in identifying who we are as a nation. It has been said that we can judge ourselves by how we treat others. I also see this test as a window into our collective conscience. I want to refer to the state of the health of our Indigenous Australians and, in so doing, turn to the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Health is life</inline><inline font-style="italic">.</inline> This report of the inquiry into Indigenous health by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs was presented to this House in May 2000. The committee received the reference from the government to conduct that inquiry. The report was a product of over two years work, involving a number of members of this House, and it is fair to say that we all desperately hoped that this report would really make a difference. It is 4½ years later, and I find it extremely distressing every time I read another front page headline or hear another news report telling us how serious the situation of Indigenous health is. The statistics are trotted out, we all agree the figures are appalling—and so on it goes. I quote from the foreword of the report:</para><quote><para>The continuing poor state of Indigenous health, and the many efforts of successive governments to address the issue, has seemingly left a nation at a loss to know what to do for the best on this issue.</para></quote><para>It went on:</para><quote><para>We know that there are no easy answers to the issues of Indigenous health and all participants in the Inquiry acknowledged the long road ahead, but we believe that our Report offers some signposts to the future.</para></quote><para>What we desperately need is leadership on this issue. We acknowledge that it would be unlikely to see significant improvement until the fragmentation of services, the cost-shifting and the lack of agreement on responsibility for Indigenous health are fully addressed. The committee agreed:</para><quote><para>... that for this to happen there must be a clear agreement between the states and the Commonwealth, not only about what their respective responsibilities are but also on how these responsibilities will be acted upon and the level of resources to be committed by all parties.</para></quote><para>It seems the realities of today remain the same: in general terms, Indigenous Australians are more likely to be unemployed or on lower incomes, less educated, imprisoned or in some form of care, homeless or living in overcrowded or substandard conditions, as well as being unwell or dying earlier than the non-Indigenous population. The life expectancy of Indigenous Australians is about 18 years shorter than for other Australians. Their age adjusted mortality is about three times the non-Indigenous rate and much higher with respect to some conditions. </para><para>An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 19 November 2004 entitled `Crowded houses are home to the plight of poverty' quoted the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Amanda Vanstone:</para><quote><para>... communities had to take responsibility for maintenance and repairs. There was to be “no more build and abandon”.</para></quote><para>The article went on:</para><quote><para>“The current state of housing is an indication the current approach is in need of change,” Senator Vanstone said. “More money, or more of the same, won't work.”</para></quote><para>The same article indicated that $2.295 billion would be required to address the Indigenous housing shortfall.</para><para>The committee's report discussed in some detail the question of maintenance and training. In relation to this issue the report talked about:</para><quote><para>... an innovative national training program about maintenance skills that is not at the trade level, but which is formal and accredited and could be extended with subsequent training to trade qualifications. Existing trade programs should continue to be supported and expanded where possible.</para><para>Focussing on ongoing maintenance and health hardware work in the communities on a long-term basis provides the potential for long-term meaningful employment which will also have considerable health benefits.</para></quote><para>It is now 4½ years since that report was produced, and where do we find ourselves today? Well, late last year we had a debate opening up in the media and elsewhere about mutual obligation—agreements calling on the community to guarantee certain behaviours such as washing children's faces, putting out the garbage, ensuring children shower every day and get to school on time, and so on. And, in return, the federal government would supply, in one case, $172,260 to provide and install petrol bowsers in a particular town. Mutually agreed approaches are not in themselves unacceptable, but we must ask: how far is this method of provision of basic service going to go?</para><para>We are all aware of the courageous action of Michael Long and the `long walk' initiative late last year. I had the opportunity of joining the walk for a brief time here in Canberra and, with many others from our community, offering my support. Following Michael Long's walk to Canberra the Prime Minister met with him and others. Some commentators at the time welcomed the Prime Minister putting the issues on the agenda: `What a good thing to have this discussion! We are now offered an opportunity we cannot ignore'—and so on, basically cheering the so-called intervention of the PM at the time. Of course that is a good thing. The point is that these issues should never be off the agenda. It should not take a walk by Michael Long or anyone else to have the Prime Minister of this country acknowledge the issues facing our Indigenous communities around the country.</para><para>The issues are diverse; they are not simple. And we all share some responsibility for the continuing poor state of health, education, employment and opportunity affecting our Indigenous communities. Some of us in this House had the opportunity through that committee inquiry to visit many city, rural and very remote Indigenous communities. We saw some wonderful examples where sheer determination and self-belief were winning out. We also saw some shocking examples of poor planning and infrastructure development, lack of care and accountability that verged, I have to admit, on the incomprehensible. How will these mutual obligation arrangements fix, for example, the construction of a community rubbish tip up hill from the houses, causing leaching into the soil? Or the construction of a new health centre including a badly needed dental care service but no funding for the dentist? Or the high rate of otitis media—commonly known as glue ear—in young children but a visit by or access to qualified audiology services being virtually impossible? Or the construction of new housing but no potable water connected to the houses? Or the supply of affordable—I repeat, affordable—fresh food in a community despite the very high cost of transportation which is also severely affected during wet season rains with road closures and flooding? Or the sense in medical evacuation from northern WA to Perth rather than across the border to Darwin because of questions as to who pays for what? Or the supply of a bus for a youth program, the funding of which precludes the elderly in the same town being allowed to use the same bus? </para><para>The examples are many and I could go on at length. I cannot see how these types of fundamental issues can be improved by a mutual obligation agreement, and I am not suggesting that they should or can be. What I am suggesting is that the federal government in a leadership role address the fundamental issues of governance, cost shifting and jurisdictional divide, and begin to move those blockages to some of the solutions along with their colleagues in the states and territories. I now turn to recommendation 1 of that report, which states:</para><quote><para>The Commonwealth accept it has the major responsibility for the provision of primary health care to Indigenous Australians:</para><para>The Commonwealth must assume responsibility for developing, in collaboration with the States and Territories, an efficient, coordinated and effective mechanism for the delivery of services and programs which impact on the health and well-being of the Indigenous population.</para></quote><para>Yes, the Indigenous people and their communities have roles and responsibilities but it is a two-way street. Let us encourage and support our Indigenous people and work with them. Mutually agreeable arrangements should be supported. However, government must be clear in what it is doing. Its responsibilities, I have to say, are clear to me. I urge the government to outline to this parliament what has been done in practical ways to address the health issues facing our Indigenous population.</para><para>The other issue I want to speak about is policy affecting our people with a disability. The new administrative arrangements of this government, I believe, show the transfer of disability support pension payments away from social security, and they are now the concern of the Minister for Workforce Participation. I note this change of governance with some concern. Let us look very carefully at this government's record and question their intent with the administrative arrangement. The government is using the results of a recent pilot study into DSP employment assistance to support their intent to coerce DSP recipients off pensions and into work. The Minister for Workforce Participation issued the results of the pilot study outlined in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> on 25 November. It was claimed that of 671 participants with disabilities who receive intensive assistance from Job Network providers one-third found employment or enrolled in education courses within six months. The minister said that the results showed that people with disabilities were `willing to work' and he went on to say:</para><quote><para>For those people that we think aren't there legitimately, then we need to try to adopt some coercion ... That's unfortunate in that minority of cases ...</para></quote><para>This government talks about coercion—a government that has done little to support any constructive move from welfare to work for people with disabilities. It is a government that in some cases has actually failed in the funding of programs designed to support these people. </para><para>Before the minister goes off and draws up his plan for coercion, he should look a little bit more closely at this pilot study. For example, 62 per cent of the participants had previously indicated a willingness to work by being registered with Centrelink as looking for work. The DSP recipients in the pilot were those who did not have any ongoing support requirements. The DSP participants volunteered. The pilot was not designed to canvass a cross-section of DSP participants and cannot expect results representative of the general DSP population. They are just a few points on a quick look at the study. It should be no surprise to the government that many people on DSP would dearly love to be back at work and not be reliant on welfare support. You do not need a study to know this; you just need to speak with them. They will tell you very clearly the problems they encounter in trying to get back to work full time, part time or casually. The reality is clear. Unfortunately people with a disability are less likely to be in the work force than those with no disability.</para><para>Consider these statistics. In the last financial year just under 10 per cent of people on the disability support pension had employment related earnings, that is around 63,000 people out of a population of 673,000. Australia has the seventh lowest employment rate in the OECD for people with a disability. According to the 2003 OECD employment outlook, Australian people with a disability had just over a 40 per cent chance of finding employment. In comparison, people with no disability had a 70 to 80 per cent chance of finding work. Nearly two-thirds of the OECD countries measured had better employment rates than Australia for people with a disability than for people with no disability. So it is not hard to imagine why people with a disability are less likely to be in the work force. I have heard many stories of people facing discrimination which may even lead to them giving up looking for a job. Others may not have access to the support they need to find employment. Some of the other challenges faced by people with a disability who want to work include low self-esteem, social isolation, dependence on welfare, poor education and transport issues.</para><para>This government has undertaken massive reforms in the disability employment sector, but no reforms are worthy unless they serve the people directly affected—that is, the people with a disability. That should be the sole motive. This pilot sounds more like another reform to suit a government agenda. While it talks about the importance of people with a disability entering the work force and the need for employers to be more innovative in this area, the Howard government over the years has employed fewer people with a disability. For example, the proportion of people with a disability employed by the Commonwealth government has decreased from 5.7 per cent in 1993 to 3.6 per cent in 2002. As I have said, any reforms can only be considered legitimate if people with a disability and their families and carers are the central focus of the reforms under consideration. Anything other than that represents a government on its own philosophical path.</para><para>It must be noted that this government tied the release of funding for 17,200 additional disability employment places to cutting the fortnightly pensions of 200,000 disability pensioners by more than $50—an initiative not agreed to by this parliament. I repeat: 17,200 additional disability support places from this government depended on people agreeing that 200,000 disability pensioners have their incomes cut. Because that did not happen, those 17,200 additional places did not come. I do not know what other people think about a government that does that, but I know what I think: it is pretty poor. </para><para>People with disabilities who are seeking to return to work must have access to appropriate services, support and adequately trained advisers within the job placement services and, most importantly, they must be given encouragement and time to allow that transition. I strongly support the proposal made by the Acting Disability Discrimination Commissioner, Dr Sev Ozdowski, for a public inquiry on the issues affecting equal employment opportunity for people with a disability in Australia. This is vital, given the government's track record in this area. The whole question of people with a disability in this country being employable, being happy to be employed and being able to be employed will not be enhanced by a government acting in a coercive manner. It will be enhanced if the government works with the community in a positive, forward-looking way, providing encouragement and support where necessary.</para><para>It is an honour for me have the opportunity to speak in the address-in-reply debate. I look forward to working with and for the people of the electorate of Canberra and working in this parliament in the hope that we can make a difference to the lives and fortunes of all in our community.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>176</page.no><name role="metadata">Moylan, Judi, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MOYLAN</name><name.id>4V5</name.id><electorate>Pearce</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a great pleasure to be here today to speak in the address-in-reply debate. In my fifth term in parliament, I still have the feeling of wonder that we are able to reinvent the process of democracy every three years—the apparent simplicity of it all, yet the sheer incredibility of it when one looks at how utterly few and endangered are the true democratic societies of our world. There are times when I wish that every person in the electorate of Pearce and beyond had the opportunity to visit this place and see the parliament in action. It is unfortunate that many see only glimpses on their television screen and the odd report in the daily paper. There is so much more to this parliament, and so much more that I think the Australian public could appreciate if they could share this experience with us.</para></talk.start><para>I am proud of the bipartisan work that is undertaken by the many committees of the parliament and the outstanding contributions of the men and women elected to office. These are men and women who represent broadly the electorates throughout Australia, 150 of them, notwithstanding their political differences. Whatever differences within our political alliances, we all regard the preservation of democracy as our first concern whenever it is threatened by the malevolent forces of fundamentalist extremism. As elected members we are well supported by the staff of Parliament House, an aspect that the public rarely gets to see. Hopefully there will be a growing awareness of the public operation of parliament through the great work of the House of Representatives Liaison and Projects Office, which has published some valuable material in recent times—including computer programs and CD-ROMs—to better inform schoolchildren and members of the public about the operation and work of this parliament. I thank and congratulate those within the parliamentary staff areas for this outstanding work. Thank you.</para><para>We have a system of government that serves us well. Many of us have watched the elections in Iraq and the courage of the Iraqi people going to the polls under such difficult circumstances. In fact my colleague here Joanna Gash went to Jordan and has been part of the process to ensure the success of the Iraqi elections. The election images beamed around the world should serve to strengthen our resolve—every one of us, whether we are members of parliament or members of the general public—to support our democratic processes and to participate fully to ensure the continuance of a strong democratic system of government. A democracy relies on not only members in this place representing their electorates but also the interaction of the Australian public with their members of parliament. Sometimes I hear from people that they do not see their member of parliament, but I always say to people, `This engagement is a two-way process.' There is an obligation on both parties, not just on members of parliament but also on members of the public, to come forward and discuss their concerns and to seek changes where those changes are appropriate. We must continue to strengthen our resolve in that regard, to have maximum participation by the Australian people in what goes on in this place. </para><para>This is also the first opportunity I have had since the federal election to place on record my appreciation to the many people who assisted me with the Pearce campaign, particularly Mr Lane Taylor, who took on the role of campaign chair as well as treasurer—a role that he has undertaken since my first campaign in 1992. That is participation and that is something to be proud of, and I am very grateful for that. He was ably supported by an excellent committee and by my staff. One is fortunate indeed to have the benefit of working with people who, with the same generosity of spirit and cheerful conviction that they have displayed in previous elections, are again committed so fully to participating in the democratic processes of our country. The electors of Pearce have once again elected me to represent them in the federal parliament, and I greatly appreciate the opportunity they have afforded me to ensure that their voices are heard in this place. I pledge myself to return to renew my energetic commitment to vigorous representation.</para><para>The Pearce electorate is a vast tract. It is the third-largest electorate in Western Australia and it includes outer suburban, rural and coastal communities with very diverse needs. The issues that are common to all include health, education, transport and telecommunications to name a few. I am grateful to our ministers in the respective portfolios for the consideration they have given to the electors of Pearce in the ongoing quest to improve these services. That said, I am very much aware that there is much more to be done. But the electorate has been well served by the legacy of over eight years of the Howard government. I will not go through all of these; I think they are fairly well understood. But economic growth has been made possible by these policies and certainly by financial deregulation and microeconomic reform, including important changes to the taxation system.</para><para>This has resulted in the benefit of economic growth and prosperity being shared amongst all Australians. That share has been very evenly distributed throughout the electorate according to the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling. They say that household income in the poorer suburbs and regions grew by 23.2 per cent, while the growth in income in the top-earning suburbs was negligibly higher at 24.2 per cent. The largest increase in household income was found in middle Australia, with a 28.9 per cent increase. So that puts paid to those who would criticise the Howard government for economic reform that delivers only to the rich. This has been a very significant contribution by the Howard government not only to ensure national prosperity but also to ensure that all members of the public benefit from that prosperity. Long may that continue.</para><para>These benefits are only possible with continuous economic reform. If we are to sustain the distribution of wealth throughout the community, we must continue down the path of reform in the future. There is no doubt about that. Some of these reforms include further reform to the taxation system. One of the things that deeply concerns me about the tax system today is that so few people understand it, even professionals. It is becoming more and more difficult. It has grown like topsy over the years and it is very hard for people to keep up with the rulings. The public have a right to expect that this parliament will deal with a reform of the tax system that allows average people to understand what their tax obligations are, and I do not think that is the case at the moment. </para><para>I do not think you will find too much disagreement anywhere that we pay too much tax, but that is always a balancing argument because our expectations are great. As long as we have great expectations of government to provide a variety of services then we will have to pay a reasonable amount of tax. I sometimes reflect on how many countries have the number of museums, theatres, libraries and other facilities that we have in Australia today. The infrastructure, which is really quite amazing for a large country, all has to be paid for. I guess the argument about the amount of taxation will be one that will be well and truly debated as the years go on.</para><para>The other area for reform is industrial relations. Having participated in the debate about the unfair dismissal laws and the attempts by the Howard government to change these laws on many occasions, I hope that commonsense will eventually prevail and that small business will be unburdened of what has been a very poor piece of legislation. It shows all the worst aspects of legislation: it was so heavily weighted against small business people, who are the primary employers of Australians in their small businesses. The last thing we want to do is discourage them from employing more people. There is always a balance to be had, but I believe that the legislation as it was before our attempts to amend it was highly prejudicial to the mums and dads in the community who run small businesses.</para><para>I also support the suggestion by the Prime Minister that we examine a single national industrial relations system and the simplification of the awards structure. Again, if we do not to take some of the worst aspects of industrial relations from our employer groups, then it is a great disincentive for businesses to grow and develop. It is a very costly system to the nation. So it has to be fair but it must also be streamlined so that you do not have the situation that exists today.</para><para>Certainly when doorknocking small businesses in my electorate over the past few weeks, I found deep concern in Western Australia about the push to bring back 24-hour trading. It is not that most business people are in essence opposed to 24-hour trading. The reason that those in Western Australia are concerned about it is the need for them to pay penalty rates to employees for working on Sunday or outside what are considered to be normal hours. This is a great difficulty for most small businesses. There is simply not the fat to be able to pay these kinds of penalty rates. The tragedy of it is that there are many people in our community today who want to work on Sundays and who want to take up part-time outside hours work. The industrial relations laws in Western Australia are a great impediment to small business supporting the competition policy requirement for 24-hour trading. Until the Western Australian state Labor government come to grips with that, they are going to continue to have resistance to a great degree from the Western Australian small business community. The fact is that by the time a small business pays penalty rates for a Sunday or outside hours there is no profit left from its opening. The current system is cumbersome and is certainly discouraging for many business owners. </para><para>The other area of continuing reform that interests me is education and training. I think the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, has provided outstanding leadership in education and training. He has done a great deal to provide solutions for many of the problems, particularly those to do with vocational training and apprenticeships, which have increased a lot. With full employment, we are seeing at the moment shortages in trade areas. Some measures have been put in place to address those, but I think we need to continue with that push because there is no doubt that future economic success is inextricably linked to having a ready and appropriately qualified work force. It is unacceptable to have the huge trade shortages that we have today with the potential to hobble many industries. Training is not just the responsibility of government though, and I want to stress this. Over the years we have seen many industries withdraw from training, relying on hiring companies to provide experienced labour for them. In an environment of rapid development and economic prosperity, this has led to a critical shortage of tradespeople across a wide area. I welcome particularly the announcements by Minister Nelson of the establishment of new training facilities. I know that work is progressing well on the implementation of this particular election commitment.</para><para>There are other areas of the social policy realm that I would like to see addressed. One of those is mental health. Sadly, we have seen the case of Cornelia Rau. What the case of Cornelia Rau has done though is highlight for both government and the Australian community that the issue of mental health is a very important and very pressing one within our community. Since the shift in policy to discourage institutionalising the mentally ill in our community, we have seen a steady number of homeless people at risk in a variety of ways as the system has failed to adequately support them. I know that the Commonwealth has been aware of the growing need for support in this area and that, through the National Mental Health Strategy, has responded with a steady increase in the amount of funding at a federal level for mental health services. The Commonwealth has contributed an increase of 128 per cent since 1993. Sadly, the states increased spending by a mere 40 per cent over the same period. Once again in mental health we are seeing a failure of consistency in approach to mental health services across the country. With a greater mobility of people, this demands a consistent approach to the delivery of services.</para><para>One of the other areas that has been of concern to me is that of unlawful arrivals in Australia. No-one can deny the terrible dilemma that faces modern governments today with an increasing number of refugees and displaced people looking for a better life outside their own countries, some of them whose lives depend on their escape from their own countries. A government has an obligation to its citizens though to have an orderly migration program and to play a role in taking legitimate refugees. As unpleasant as mandatory detention is, I cannot think of many options available to initially process people who arrive without appropriate entry visas. The responsibility of government is heightened by the events of 9/11 and the international environment in which we find ourselves in the 21st century.</para><para>I continue to be concerned about the lengthy time people are being held in detention before a determination is made. I remain particularly concerned about the effect of long detention periods on children, and I believe we should urgently establish an independent review process on how to shorten the period of mandatory detention and improve practices for dealing with unlawful arrivals. There are people who have been in detention centres since they were children. They have now become adults and remain in those centres. There are some who, as adults, have been in detention for in excess of six years. This is one of the policy areas that I personally am committed to seeing addressed in this term of parliament. </para><para> Aboriginal reconciliation and Aboriginal health remain issues for me. Listening to a radio program over the holiday, I was shocked and saddened by a report on Aboriginal returned servicemen. Apparently, they went unrecognised after returning from the war and most often died without recognition. They did not receive the same benefits as other returned servicemen. I did not know that and I was shocked to learn of it. In fact, a farmer and his wife from Western Australia spoke on the program and what they said was very touching. The program, though, offered a glimmer of hope with the restoration of the graves of Aboriginal ex-servicemen and the appropriate recognition on the headstone of service to their country.</para><para> It made me stop and think that this is just one of many injustices done to Aboriginal people, who were, after all, the first people of the land. It is a matter of enduring shame that so many Aboriginal people still live in circumstances long unacceptable to most of us. Practical reconciliation is an important part of dealing with the continuing poor state of Aboriginal health, housing and education; but it is not enough. Listening to the relatives of the Aboriginal servicemen in the radio program, I was touched by their humility and gratefulness in the face of  the awful neglect of men who should have been treated with dignity and respect and who have lain in unmarked graves until very recently.</para><para> We have inherited a bountiful, beautiful country without the awful violence that has marked the colonisation and settlement of other nations. This is in part I am certain due to the peaceful, sharing nature of Aboriginal people. Over the years we have jumped from being overpatronising to having little interest or support for the broader issues facing Aboriginal communities caught in the dilemma of preserving the remnants of an amazing culture with the need to engage with a contemporary world. However difficult that task may be and however uncomfortable we may feel, we owe our Aboriginal people more than practical reconciliation. There is a need for us to recognise the injustices and the ill-conceived policies, no matter how well meaning they were. Once we can accept and acknowledge this without compromise, then and only then can we walk hand in hand with our Aboriginal brothers and sisters to a better future. It requires humility. We must be able to acknowledge the injustices without equivocation. Further, we need to highlight the successes, for there are many within the Aboriginal communities, and to be optimistic and hopeful for a brighter future. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>180</page.no><name role="metadata">Corcoran, Ann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms CORCORAN</name><name.id>009CW</name.id><electorate>Isaacs</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are a number of issues I would like to speak about today in the address-in-reply of the Governor-General's speech. The first has to be to thank the electors of Isaacs for, once again, asking me to represent them here in Australia's parliament. To be elected to represent one's neighbours and fellow residents across, in my case, a number of suburbs is a great honour. I intend to continue to do all I can to represent the people of Isaacs as well as I can by being available to them as much as possible. For instance, I will be continuing my practice of conducting mobile offices in shopping centres outside office hours throughout the year and I will be continuing my program of doorknocking throughout the parliamentary term.</para></talk.start><para>I think that one of the risks of being elected to parliament is to get too involved in all the wonderful opportunities that present themselves outside the electorate and suddenly not have any time for the most important opportunity of all—that is, to hear what is going on in your own backyard. I intend to do all I can to make sure that I continue to remember the most important people: those whom I represent when I am in Canberra. </para><para>I am disappointed in the election result. I am pleased that I have been returned to parliament, but I wish that I had the company of a few more of my colleagues and that we were all sitting on the other side of the House. But the Australian people have spoken. We live in a democracy and we abide by the decision of the people despite personal feelings. The election just gone did not focus, as many experts predicted, on the war in Iraq, on refugees or even on national security. Despite the changed conditions in our world, grassroots issues and local worries took centre stage. Health and education were the issues most often raised with me during the election campaign period. The next group of issues most often raised with me were to do with the war in Iraq, our relationship with the US and the honesty of the current government.</para><para>But it is clear from the election results that the economy, or more accurately its effect on individual households, was the major issue in Isaacs. A decent life with a secure income—hopefully from a satisfying job—good affordable health care, access to excellent education, and respect for the physical environment and our neighbours, both local and global, should be features of our society. Many of Australia's policies in these areas have been the envy of many other countries, but I am afraid that much of this is about to disappear. In order to ensure that we continue in an effective society we, in this parliament, have an obligation to ensure that everyone is able to enjoy a decent life. We are all Australians and nobody has more of a claim than anybody else to a good way of life or a chance to enjoy life. In a fair and decent society, we will always make decisions that protect the weak—even to the disadvantage of the strong. A fair and decent society will ensure proper care of all its members whatever their strengths, weaknesses and capacities. It does not reward those who already have plenty at the expense of those who have less. A fair and decent society accepts and enjoys differences, and encourages and even demands tolerance.</para><para>The Speaker, in his first speech as the newly elected Speaker, reminded us that the eyes of the nation are on us as we go about our business here in parliament. The Speaker said:</para><quote><para>We all have a responsibility to repay the trust of our citizens by discharging our duties in a way worthy of respect.</para></quote><para>I have said before in this place that our behaviour, particularly in question time, is not always conducive to respect. It is clear to all of us here that question time is not typical of a parliamentary day, but that is not the perception of most Australians and of the people who speak to me. For most people, parliament is the bit of question time that they see on the nightly news when we are often engaged in behaviour in keeping with the rowdier elements of a football crowd when the umpire has made the wrong decision.</para><para>Parliament is one of our places of business and we are at work. We have been given the job of representing our constituency in federal parliament, making decisions that shape our nation and affect everyone's daily lives. The people of Australia deserve to feel assured that we are executing our jobs professionally and properly. I do not think the parliament that the public sees—that is, a bit of question time—offers anyone that reassurance. To my mind, it is most important that Australians have confidence in their MPs. It is important for a number of reasons: one of them being the ongoing health of our democracy. If people become disillusioned about our system of government, they will withdraw from it. </para><para>We are already seeing a significant number of voters who express absolute disinterest in voting. Recently there have been a few calls from government MPs and senators for the introduction of non-compulsory voting. Those calling for this change cite an increasing number of voters who say they are disinterested as a reason for that change. I guess their argument runs along the lines of: if a voter does not care or cannot be bothered why make them vote? But I argue that this is exactly what we should not do. We must address the don't care attitude, not accept it as unmovable. The don't care attitude is certainly not acceptable if we are at all interested in looking after our democracy. The suggestion that we move to non-compulsory voting is a step backwards, a step away from a strong democracy. Voting should be considered a responsibility not just a right. One thing that can be done immediately to redress this attitude of `why bother' is to polish up our image, particularly the way we behave in parliament. If we are seen to behave in a professional way then this is a good first step.</para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, it comes as no news to you that Labor has long been aware of the need to reform the health system. Presently something like $500 million per year is wasted because of the delineation between federal and state health systems. In particular, there are many frail and aged people in acute beds in public hospitals waiting for a bed in an aged care facility. This situation is distressing for older people and their families, frustrating for those trying to find beds for acute patients and a waste of our resources. I urge the government to adopt a policy similar to the one called Medicare Gold announced by Labor during the election campaign. The principle of Medicare Gold was excellent. It allows one level of government to fund the health and accommodation requirements of our aged and frail people, saving half a billion dollars a year and giving the aged the security of knowing that they will have access to appropriate and affordable health care when they need it.</para><para>The Howard government does not have a clear view of the real needs of Australians in the health field. Policy fixes and bandaids like MedicarePlus and the so-called Medicare safety net do little to instil confidence in those who need access to doctors and health professionals. The safety net will see the evolution of a two-tiered health system in Australia—the end to access to excellent and affordable health care regardless of who you are and the depths of your pocket. Medicare, and before it Medibank, has been the cornerstone of Australia's health system for a quarter of a century. A system that was once the envy of the world is being eroded by the short-sighted policies of the Howard government. The Prime Minister has never been a fan of Medicare. He has always wanted to demolish it and will now do so.</para><para>Labor want to strengthen Medicare and restore bulk-billing for all Australians. Labor are committed to restoring a national role for the provision of dental health to remove the unacceptable situation of many people who are waiting for a long time for essential dental care. We are committed to public funding for all listed vaccines—a policy which stands in stark contrast to the government's policy. The government's policy is one of only providing funding for recommended vaccines when shamed into it by the strength of public opinion, as evidenced last year in the pneumococcal vaccine debate.</para><para>One of what I call the `sleeping issues' is unemployment in the older work force, so-called mature age unemployment. A number of older men—and it is usually men—have recently told me about problems they experienced in finding a job. Often the person has been employed for most of his life and is now suddenly out of work because of redundancy or downsizing. These people often face a different set of problems to other unemployed people, but these problems are, nevertheless, just as important and need to be addressed. A typical case is a man in his late 40s or 50s, out of work often for the first time, often well qualified or skilled in his old job and often in a household where his partner works and has a reasonable income. The older unemployed person usually experiences the same feelings as other unemployed people do: loss of confidence, immense frustration at being unable to find work and a feeling of the world passing by and of suddenly being invisible. Add to this the frustration of not being eligible for assistance at Job Network because of a partner's income, and you end up with someone very frustrated and often angry—and with good cause. </para><para>I was delighted that the Labor Party's policies included specific plans to provide assistance to those mature age unemployed people. Labor's policy had a number of measures to assist older people who were out of work. One of those proposals was the establishment of mature age career centres. These centres would provide assistance and support targeted to mature age Australians out of work and would help them get back into work. The challenge for the government now is to take the necessary steps to look after these people and to ensure that their skills and experiences are not lost to the work force.</para><para>All we have had so far from the Howard government is a promise of a mature age worker tax offset. Workers over 55 who earn up to $48,000 a year will receive a $500-a-year tax break. I am not knocking the tax break for older workers, but it is hardly a policy to assist those out of work. This policy does nothing to address the generalisations and misconceptions about older workers, nor does it provide incentives for employers to retrain or hire older workers. The Governor-General has said that there are links between skills and achievements and a robust economy, yet the Howard government has few policies that address the difficulty older people have in finding employment. The truth is that, more than ever, the experience and knowledge of mature age workers is needed. With an ageing population, the need to recognise the skills and stability of mature workers is a necessity if we are all to use our resources to build a strong economy and support our ageing population.</para><para>As I said earlier, the economy was an important issue in the election campaign. People responded to the clever interest rate scare campaign. The fact that many people are so close to the edge financially is a direct result of the policies of this government over recent years. The government likes to claim credit for a good economy, yet many people no longer have the security of a reliable permanent job. Many people are living with what I have heard referred to as `a portfolio of jobs'. That is polite talk for someone trying to hold down a number of part-time or casual jobs, instead of having the comfort and security of one full-time permanent job.</para><para>In this strong economy I note that as a nation Australia is spending far more than it earns. Our current account deficit has hit record levels. We cannot continue along this path. The situation is unsustainable, yet we hear nothing from the government of plans to address this issue—sensible plans, that is.</para><para>What is unacceptable is for the Howard government to claim that they can control interest rates and that they are the only party that is economically responsible. History shows that, as Treasurer, John Howard presided over four consecutive budget deficits in the late seventies and early eighties. We hear about high interest rates under the Hawke government, but we do not hear about the fact that, when the coalition was tossed out in 1983, interest rates were around 16 per cent. They moved up and down over the next few years, peaking at 17 per cent, as we are so often reminded, before steadily falling to around seven per cent when Labor lost office in 1996. Since then interest rates have moved a bit and are now around 5½ per cent. </para><para>It is interesting too to look at Australia's interest rate history compared with rates in other countries. Australia's interest rates have always moved consistently with movements in other countries, the lesson being that interest rates are not under the direct control of government. Firstly, the Reserve Bank sets the interest rate and it is independent of the government. Secondly, Australia is part of a wider economy and our rates will move broadly with the fortunes or otherwise of like nations.</para><para>There is a shortage of skilled workers in Australia. Many people, including the Business Council of Australia, have been telling us this for some time. The response we now have from the government is to establish a few federally run technical colleges. There is no logic to this. We have a TAFE system in place which is crying out for more places so that it can meet the demand of students. We have industry crying out for more skilled workers. But the government takes the longwinded approach of developing another system on top of an existing one—a system which will take many years to produce graduates. This is a crazy solution to the problem. It is wasting the resources of our young people who today, right now, cannot get into TAFE. The challenge for the government is to abandon this crazy idea and fund places in the system that already exists and get on with training our young people, providing the skills that we need.</para><para>Another challenge the government must face in this term is the growing crisis in aged care. I have already talked a bit about the need to streamline the provision of aged care services, but there are other aspects to this issue. There is a shortage of places, exacerbated by the long lead times of bringing beds into operation once the bed licences have been issued. We have to get much better at providing an adequate number of beds, we have to get better at bringing them on line more quickly and we have to get better at providing the right mix of low- and high-level care beds.</para><para>Aged care operators in Isaacs tell me that, more and more, those entering the system for the first time are frailer and sicker than those entering the system for the first time a decade ago. This is probably a reflection of people's determination to stay at home as long as possible, coupled with better services provided to those at home. What it means for the aged care sector, though, is the need for a different mix of beds, more high-level beds, more services for those at home and more respite services to help the carers of those staying at home but needing day-to-day care.</para><para>The aged care sector also faces problems with staffing. Nurses in the aged care sector earn less than those in the acute sector, with the result that it is increasingly hard to attract and then keep staff in the aged care sector. Attention must also be paid to the question of adequate capital funding of aged care facilities. This does not mean bonds, but it does mean providing adequate funding so that aged care facilities can maintain decent physical facilities.</para><para>I have mentioned some of the challenges facing Australia. I have not talked about others such as the need for reform in the funding arrangements for schools, the need to provide for the thousands of people caring for frail relatives or disabled people, the need to improve at government level our attitude to our physical environment and to our Indigenous community, and our responsibilities in the global community. I will be doing all I can from this side of the House to keep the pressure on the government to attend properly to the challenges that this country and my electorate are facing. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>185</page.no><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TUCKEY</name><name.id>SJ4</name.id><electorate>O'Connor</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is with considerable pleasure, even at this late time and in this chamber, that I get my opportunity, in the address-in-reply debate, to respond to the Governor-General's speech. In looking to the document, I see a series of subheadings which are all-important to the interests of Australians. The first heading is `Maintaining a strong economy' and many of the other headings relate back to that commitment. I was somewhat disappointed, nevertheless, to find that throughout that series of commitments nothing was said about taxation reform. Taxation reform does not necessarily mean tax cuts. There is a great old statement about taxation. The perfect tax requires simplicity, equity and certainty—or it might be the other way around: simplicity, certainty and equity. I do not think the Australian tax system at state, local or Commonwealth level meets any of those criteria. It is a challenge to this parliament—not this government—to address those principles and see what we can do about a stack of paperwork and all the tragedies that are brought to our attention as people spend half their business life or their personal life trying to reduce the burden arising, in the case of personal taxation, from bracket creep in particular.</para></talk.start><para>I thought it would be a good opportunity to put on the record just a few facts that I obtained in trying to address these principles myself. The advice I received is very interesting. I asked this question of the Library—who gave me this information from the statistics; it is not their view: how many taxpayers have a gross income below $6,000, below $10,000 and below $15,000? The latest statistics—which, I might add, are from 2001-02—are that there are 10,343,677 taxpayers and, of these, 1.7335 million, or 16.8 per cent, had total incomes of less than $10,000 and 2.7 million, in round figures, or 26.1 per cent, had total incomes of less than $15,000. There are no published figures on my other question.</para><para>Then I asked: how much government revenue would be received if all income earners above $10,000 were taxed from the first dollar at 17c or 10c, but all under $10,000 paid nothing? In other words, you paid on all your income if you earned more than $10,000. It was estimated that for 2004-05 if those individuals with taxable income of less than $10,001 paid no tax and all other taxable individuals paid 10 per cent, the additional revenue would be $3.1 billion. If we made it 17 per cent, the additional revenue would be $9.1 billion.</para><para>I also asked how much revenue we receive in the various categories of taxation—that is, the 17 per cent rate, the 30 per cent rate, the 42 per cent rate and the 47 per cent rate. It is interesting to note that, presently, the 17 per cent rate delivers 22 per cent of the total tax collected; the 30 per cent rate, 44 per cent of the total tax collected; the 42 per cent rate, seven per cent of the total tax collected; and the 47 per cent rate, 26 per cent of the total tax collected. That is a huge burden because, even on the proposed future brackets, too many Australians are moving into the two higher brackets, 42 and 47 per cent, and they do not equate with the company tax rate, which is 30 per cent. So what do people do? They waste the time of their accountants, who should be telling them how to run their business—and this is even at the corporate level—trying to find ways to escape that problem. We have all heard of the family trust and the associated company arrangements that have to be put in place. Having been in that field for years as a business man, and then moving to this parliament, where I wished to extricate myself from a lot of those arrangements, I discovered just how difficult that was and what a mess it had created in our financial dealings as a family. </para><para>Why do we do it? As Terry McCrann quite properly told us in an article the other day, we are all rich people seeking to distribute or claim as many $6,000 tax-free thresholds as we can. If we had to pay tax from the first dollar that would not be an option, and therefore the interest in a lot of those complex arrangements would disappear overnight. Of course this issue could be addressed, as I have pointed out, simply by saying nobody pays tax if they earn less than $10,000. That is a fairly generous arrangement for the 17 per cent who are in that category. At the same time, those people who earn greater amounts would start paying with the first dollar, and if that were 17 per cent we would find that the $9.1 billion of revenue would be fairly close to the $13 billion of revenue the government would lose if it discontinued the 42 per cent and 47 per cent tax rates. That is not perfect, but I guess it addresses the simplicity argument. Someone might say I am simple to even put it up, but too many people are making money out of the complexity, and I think that is a great pity. It just brings to our attention better ways perhaps of achieving those three criteria.</para><para>Let us look at where the money is spent and how it is raised through other avenues. State revenue, according to the advice I have received, is about $75 billion. Do not think this is going to happen tomorrow, because much more powerful people in my party make these decisions, but I asked a question as to what would happen if GST were applied to all transactions without exemption and the rate was five per cent, 10 per cent and 12 per cent. I am told that at five per cent the revenue would be $21.2 billion; at 10 per cent, $42.4 billion; and at 12 per cent, $50.9 billion—and maybe I should have asked what the revenue would be at 15 per cent.</para><para>GST revenue in the year 2003-04 was $33 billion, with our highly complex arrangements. So we have states expending $75 billion with all their nasty taxes—and I want to refer to them, but they are not their fault. On extrapolating those figures, the total state revenue of $75 billion could probably be met with a 15 per cent GST rate. They could get rid of payroll tax, stamp duty and all those things, other than in my mind a fee relative to the actual service provided. That is how stamp duty started: it was a fee to record your property transaction—and that was quite appropriate, but it converted to a revenue measure over time.</para><para>In looking at this you would immediately say: `What about the poor people? They'd have to pay 15 per cent on a lettuce; isn't that terrible?' But the average Australian moves house every seven years. Even for a modest residence today the stamp duty would be $10,000 or $12,000. Divide that by seven and that is over $1,500 a year in personal tax, but nobody thinks about it in that context. Of course, if they buy a new car every three years, they would need to pay another $1,000 or whatever in state stamp duty. So wouldn't they possibly be better off paying 15 per cent on a lettuce—that is a question, not a statement—instead of those other taxes and payroll tax?</para><para>If you think there is no payroll tax on a tin of beans, think again. There is no such thing as a free lunch. To make a profit, a business that is paying payroll tax must pass it on to the consumer. Of course we know the detriments that that tax has in terms of its complexity and the employment decisions of employers et cetera. If they are an exporter then that is a burden they carry when they are competing in the real world with other countries that have different forms of taxation. So would it be better to have a GST that does not tax exports as the sole means of state revenue?</para><para>These are the sorts of figures that I think can be talked about. They do not involve any substantial reduction in the overall tax burden, but certainly there would be some shifting. Nevertheless, I do not see why Wilson Tuckey or Kerry Packer need $6,000 of their income tax free. I think that, even on our rather poor salaries, we would be better off paying 17c on $6,000 than 47c on $20,000 or $30,000 or whatever it is. There would be benefits. </para><para>There are shearers working in my electorate who refuse to shear more than 150 sheep a day. Some of them can shear 200 sheep, but they say, `I'm not going to sheer the last 50 sheep for the taxman.' So what happens? The shearing period gets extended and everybody—the contractor, the farmer and eventually the consumer—has to pay the shed hands for a couple of extra days to get the job finished. That is not necessarily good for anyone. So there are a lot of disincentives in those high tax rates.</para><para>I argue very strongly that the top personal tax rate should always be harmonised with the company tax rate, whatever it is. All the schemes that cause people pain, and the fights that follow with the Taxation Commissioner, would suddenly cease. Nevertheless, in terms of the administration of the tax act, I have never been able to understand why we as a parliament have not promoted a simple law which says that, if a taxpayer makes a full disclosure to the ATO which is later disputed by the Taxation Commissioner—and that is fair enough—any penalties or interest should only apply, say, 60 days after the Taxation Commissioner notifies the taxpayer that he disagrees with their personal calculation of how much tax they owe. I cannot see how people can go for three or four years making certain claims and then get a letter in the mail from the Taxation Commissioner which says: `Three or four years ago you did something with which I now disagree. I am therefore hitting you with heavy penalties and interest charges over that period.' That often puts people in a position where they go broke. I cannot understand how there is any certainty, simplicity or, more particularly, equity in that arrangement.</para><para>I believe that our parliament should say it is a fundamental rule that, until the Taxation Commissioner tells you he disagrees, you cannot be hit with penalties or interest for that period. It should be up to the Taxation Commissioner. As they once did, he can look at your tax return and write to you the following day. The rule is that you should make full disclosure and not tell untruths. So if you say, `I earned all this money and I entered scheme X and I believe that entitled me to reduce my tax by Y,' I see no reason whatsoever why, in those circumstances, you should be penalised until the Taxation Commissioner disagrees.</para><para>I put those few figures on the record for people to consider. We probably should sit down as a parliament and come up with alternatives of that nature. But my target is the removal of tax avoidance. I think the $6,000 tax-free threshold is much more beneficial to high-income earners than low-income earners. I really do. I think we need to have a better approach to that, notwithstanding that low-income earners are not expected to pay tax at the same rate as people in higher income categories. Having said that, I hope the parliament will see in the next three years a major approach to this from both sides.</para><para>I have sat through 13 years of opposition in this place. And I made the point yesterday that the Prime Minister has given credit to Bob Hawke, in particular, for the reforms that passed through this parliament during the Hawke government—when Keating was Treasurer—and the Keating government. Most of them got through the caucus because Keating or Hawke were able to go to the caucus and say, `You'll get no trouble from the coalition opposition on this issue.' I sat there in the shadow cabinet for years judging new policy announcements. When Keating came up with his GST we did not knock it. The trade unions knocked it, but we did not. They pulled the rug out from under him. As I recollect, it was all decided in a motel room. But the reality is that we said it was a positive measure. </para><para>A great challenge to the Labor Party and its new leader is to look at things and analyse them for the benefit of Australia, not for whether they are going to win or lose the next election. I think Aussies have gone well past the gravy train, notwithstanding we all still ride it. Australians are a lot more analytical and they want to see members of parliament get together on good issues, not running scare campaigns just because they sound good, not surfing to re-election on a tax that the community has now accepted and that might be the better source of 100 per cent of state revenues if we got rid of all those other taxes. Who stops to think that their house costs them $1,500 a year in stamp duty? That is about 30 bucks a week. Nobody thinks of it but that is what it is statistically. Of course it has even been a threat to the building industry at times because people have stood back and said, `I can't afford to buy a new house because I can't afford to sell the old one,' and that is a problem because we want people to buy new houses. It is good for the economy.</para><para>Because there is no such thing as a free lunch, I constantly remind people that with some deregulation of the labour market there has been a very substantial increase in the buying power of the average wage earner. Money? As we all know, at times during the Weimar Republic you needed a wheelbarrow to take enough money to buy a loaf of bread. Dollars? Not worth anything, more particularly if the tax man is the biggest beneficiary. But the fact of life is that, under the Howard government, workers' buying power has gone up by about 13 per cent. That statistically compares to two per cent over 13 years of the Hawke government and the Accord. Why? Because the Accord kept providing more cash but it did not provide the offsets in productivity that meant that Mrs Worker could buy things at a competitive price. The Chinese have fixed that up, and it is now a fact that children's clothing is cheaper than when I was clothing my children 40 years ago. Certainly in real terms it is much cheaper. That is as good as a pay increase.</para><para>We have to look at it in this way. It is no good going out there and saying, `Now is the time to grab a heap of dollars,' if it puts up our taxes, puts up costs to employers and eventually puts up the prices in supermarkets. But I do not think the world is ever going to let us get away with that again. Free markets are a given and they are happening here in Australia. Of course, most of the time the beneficiary is the consumer, and that is a good thing. So we have to win and maintain our living standard in two areas. We want good government—and I think the infrastructure argument is very important.</para><para>I have spent a lot of time on tax now and I will not get to the other things I wanted to say, but we are going to have to make hydrogen in this country and fuel all our vehicles with it. We can make it all from renewable energy. My farmers can make enough of it from the sun to use on their farms. We can use the tides of the Kimberleys, and I invite the Labor opposition to give my mob a touch up and say you will do it. Colin Barnett has grabbed the political initiative in WA by saying that he will bring water down from the north and he does not care what it costs. People are interested in those things. We have enough energy in the tides of the Kimberleys, otherwise unusable, to liquefy hydrogen, put it in a ship like we do with natural gas—there is no rocket science involved—and ship it to Sydney. General Motors told us in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on the 19th of last month that they will be selling hydrogen cars in 2010. </para><para>We have got three buses running around Perth doing a wonderful job, and all that comes out of their exhaust pipes is steam. They are the only three in the Southern Hemisphere. It is a wonderful example of what we can do; we should be planning for that together. It is no good saying you are going to have hydrogen cars and then burn coal to electrolyse the water to make it. Let the coal industry generate the 50 per cent of energy needed for electricity—that is convenient and cheap. Let us put all our wheels under hydrogen, and 50 per cent of our energy consumption will be clean and can be generated by renewable resources. As I said, I should have allowed more time for this issue. They are all interesting issues. If we get those things right as a parliament, the community will be eternally grateful.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>189</page.no><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Welcome back to the Speaker's panel, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick. It is really good to see you presiding over the affairs of the Main Committee this morning. In my contribution to the address-in-reply debate I want to discuss an issue that has been neglected by the Prime Minister as well as the Governor-General in his remarks at the opening of this parliament. It is the issue of increasing poverty in Australia and the increasing inequality that we are seeing between the haves and the have-nots. It is true that the Prime Minister has nominated reform of the industrial relations system and welfare reform as the big ticket items for his fourth term of office. Yet I am surprised by the continuing silence of the Prime Minister, and the Governor-General in his address, about what I see as one of the nation's biggest problems—that is, poverty and growing inequality.</para></talk.start><para>The Prime Minister would be well advised to take a leaf out of Nelson Mandela's book. In addressing a recent mass rally in London, which was focusing on the very critical issue of global poverty, Nelson Mandela had this to say:</para><quote><para>Like slavery and apartheid, poverty is not natural. It is man-made and it can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings.</para><para>And Overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity ... It is the protection of a fundamental human right, the right to dignity and a decent life.</para></quote><para>If our Prime Minister was really serious about improving the wellbeing of people in our community, he would elevate these two issues to the forefront of public policy debate and action in this country. In so doing he could really make a difference to the lot of many in our community who are witnessing the steady erosion of the notion of a fair go. We often hear Australia spoken of as a land of great opportunity with Australians enjoying a high standard of living and wellbeing. This is becoming increasingly true only for the majority in our country as a disturbingly high and growing number of people in our midst are living in poverty and denied the opportunities that come with economic and social wellbeing.</para><para>While financial hardship is the most obvious dimension of poverty, and usually the criteria that is used to define what we understand as the poverty line in this nation, people who live in relative poverty also lack the resources required for them to participate as full members of our society. The 2004 comprehensive Senate inquiry into poverty and financial hardship examined a number of ways of measuring poverty and concluded that there is:</para><quote><para>... a consensus that the numbers of Australians living in poverty generally ranges from 2 to 3.5 million ...</para></quote><para>So the strong economic gains that we hear so much about from the Prime Minister and from the government, particularly in contributions in the House and in the Governor-General's opening address, have not been fairly shared by all our citizens. </para><para>While our economic indicators have continued to reach upwards, so has the level of inequality, poverty, homelessness, long-term unemployment, suicide and child abuse. Clearly something is going drastically wrong. The current levels of poverty in a country as rich as ours is quite unacceptable. There is, as people have described it, a blindness of affluence that affects our public debate, for it is largely the people reaping the benefits of economic growth who are also analysing and writing about national issues and setting the agenda. Those who are falling by the wayside regrettably have little voice to articulate the issues of concern to them and their communities. The Howard government continues to turn a blind eye to these problems. It has no strategy to tackle poverty and inequality in our society. In fact the government is abrogating its responsibility to tackle this great indignity.</para><para>While people can argue about what level is appropriate for setting the poverty line—some people argue it should be based on average wages or median wages—they all agree, and there can be no denying, that poverty is growing and that there are numerous deprivations that come with being poor. The Senate report to which I referred documents the close association between poverty and inequality of opportunity and reveals that the disadvantage in our nation is increasingly concentrated and geographic in its manifestations. I refer to a number of key indicators of poverty and inequality. These include the statistic that I referred to earlier—that between two million and 3½ million Australians today are living in poverty and that number has increased under the Howard government's stewardship. Today, around 700,000 children are growing up in households in Australia in which neither parent works. The number of working poor is on the increase, with nearly one million working families not earning enough to lift them above the poverty line. While one-tenth of Australian households now own 45 per cent of our wealth, half the number of households in Australia own only seven per cent. Surely this reveals the extent of inequality in our midst.</para><para>As we all know, poverty is associated with poorer health outcomes, behavioural difficulties, low educational attainment, juvenile offending, social isolation and lack of support. Very disturbingly, intergenerational poverty is becoming a growing reality for a significant number of Australian families, some of whom live in my electorate. Voluntary and church organisations throughout the length and breadth of Australia continue to report a large growth in the number of people accessing their services and coming to them for emergency relief and assistance. The harsh reality of the situation in Australia was reinforced in a recently released UN human development index in 2004. It showed what we all know—that Australia was performing very well in terms of economic targets. It showed Australia's economic growth helped rank us third in the highly developed world for our human development but, at the same time, Australia was among the worst performers when it came to poverty. Australia was placed fourth on the human poverty index, with the United States, not surprisingly, the worst performer.</para><para>Added to this national dimension of poverty and inequality is a new phenomenon that is developing, one that is referred to as `postcode poverty'. In a recent study by the Ignatius Centre released last year, titled Community Adversity and Resilience, the centre measured the concentration of disadvantage according to postcode areas in New South Wales and Victoria. I took a particular interest in the findings of this report, for among the 40 highest ranking New South Wales postcode areas on a general disadvantage factor were three postcodes in my electorate of Throsby—the postcodes covering the suburbs around Warrawong, Berkeley and Port Kembla. Let me say a little about these areas. </para><para>In the suburbs that I have mentioned the median individual income, according to the most recent census data, is between $233 and $263 per week. The median family income is in the range of $435 to $550. In one area alone, the unemployment rate is recorded as being 20.2 per cent. In my electorate of Throsby, 22 per cent of children aged under 15 now live in families where no person is employed. These are real people, not just statistics. We need to deal with the problems that automatically arise—the fact that 7,000 children in my electorate are today growing up in homes where no-one has a connection with paid employment.</para><para>Naturally I was very interested in examining the conclusions of the study and what suggestions the Ignatius Centre, in its report, made for future policy and action. I want to point to a few of them. The study found that in Australia we are now witnessing growing areas of entrenched social disadvantage and intergenerational poverty that is related to where one lives, hence the term `postcode poverty'. It showed quite clearly that social exclusion breeds social alienation and the social problems that come with it. But, interestingly enough, the study also found that communities that can score highly on the measure of social cohesion seem to cope considerably better in the face of unemployment, low family income, low occupational skills and limited education. The study found that the causes and potential remedies of social disadvantage are located at many levels. The research paper goes on to argue:</para><quote><para>Without diminishing in any way the importance of macroeconomic factors to the economic and social health of a neighbourhood, the findings are a reminder that a community's internal relations can also play a significant part in shaping its wellbeing.</para></quote><para>Following from this the authors argue:</para><quote><para>... strengthening the connectedness or social cohesion of disadvantaged areas is an integral part of renewing the life opportunities of people.</para></quote><para>So I think we can say with some degree of certainty that some communities facing and burdened by disadvantage appear more resilient than others in overcoming adversity and making the most of opportunities that come along.</para><para>These research findings would have very important implications for government policy and strategies for dealing with poverty if there were the political will to take them up. In particular, this study shows, firstly, that we need locality-specific measures to supplement general policy initiatives in dealing with disadvantage and poverty. Secondly, the study shows that there needs to be a redefinition of the relationship between communities and government agencies. In other words, this involves a different way of agencies working with communities. What seems very central is the need to build a sense of partnership with the community and to build a sense of commitment and community ownership.</para><para>When disadvantage has become entrenched in a community over many years—or even over decades—as it has in parts of my electorate, governments need to understand that matters cannot be put right within a yearly or three-yearly funding cycle. I had reason to write recently to the Minister for Family and Community Services on behalf of a number of local projects that were facing the end of their funding rounds. One in particular, the Bundaleer project run by Barnardos, is doing some magnificent work on a public housing estate in my electorate. Yet no sooner had the first funding round been put into place, with a community development officer and really good positive outcomes being achieved, than they found that the guidelines for the next round of funding had changed—and the all too frequent cycle of applying and waiting for approval from government befell that project. I want to reinforce again the point that if you want to see good outcomes then you have to understand that you will not overcome intergenerational poverty with a funding grant of a year or, at best, three years. We need governments to work in a more holistic way with the communities, building their own self-confidence and community capacity. </para><para>There is a clear message in the findings of this important research that the Howard government should be acknowledging and heeding. The authors said:</para><quote><para>If for the first time in Australia's history, one's destiny might be shaped by one's location, or even one's postcode—</para></quote><para>whether that be an urban, regional or remote community—</para><quote><para>it might be time to rethink some of the rules of the game.</para></quote><para>I do not think the argument could be put more succinctly.</para><para>The recent Senate inquiry into poverty both heard and documented an enormous range of stories about the impact of poverty on our community. Through many submissions a number of important messages came through. Firstly, poverty is not just about disadvantage and financial hardship; it is also about exclusion and lack of opportunity and choice. Secondly and very importantly, tackling poverty requires leadership by the national government and a strategy involving all levels of government working in partnership with a range of business and community organisations. I would argue that it is not too late for the Howard government to address this problem, but it does require political will and acknowledgement of growing inequality and poverty at a time of relative economic prosperity. In the chamber we often hear both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister talking up the economic outcomes. There is no doubt that, relative to other advanced economies, Australia is faring very well, although a number of worrying signs are beginning to emerge. But we never hear the same government talk about this underlying problem, because this government is also afflicted by the `blindness of affluence'. It does not really see and does not really appreciate what it is like to be living in one of these very disadvantaged communities.</para><para>We need a national strategy initiated by the government, complete with performance targets for poverty alleviation. That call has been made widely by a number of church and welfare organisations as well. This is precisely what occurred in Ireland with their adoption of a national antipoverty strategy. The Irish government aims to combat poverty in the medium to long term and develop an explicit definition of poverty and an understanding of the causes of poverty and social exclusion. In Britain, the SureStart early intervention program is now operating in 500 disadvantaged neighbourhoods, providing a more holistic approach and response to these issues.</para><para>I urge the government to act on a national antipoverty plan if it is really serious about producing positive outcomes for our community in this term of office. In my view, such a plan would result in far more beneficial outcomes for a wider group of people than the ideologically driven industrial relations and welfare reforms that the Howard government is intent on pursuing. I believe that, in this ideologically driven quest to change the industrial relations system, the people that I have been talking about today, who are very much the victims of poverty and inequality, will be further disadvantaged by the deregulation of the existing protections that we find in our industrial relations system. We can only add to the growing numbers of working poor and those living in poverty by having an agenda that tries to dismantle the protections that have been in place for a long time to look after the needs and interests of those with little bargaining power in the work force. </para><para>Similarly, I am very concerned, on behalf of the great numbers of people on the disability support pension in my electorate, that the reforms in this area are going to force the many people finding it hard to make ends meet into even more precarious situations in the future. So while we can all take heart from some of the very good economic outcomes that we have seen over the last couple of decades, many of them put into place by the reforms undertaken by earlier Labor governments, I think it is time that the Howard government acknowledged that, despite our economic gains, there are increasing numbers of Australians living in poverty. It is a major national issue. Inequality in our society is growing, and the time has come for the government to take some national action on this issue, because it does require political will, not what we are seeing: turning of a blind eye to the poverty that exists in our communities.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>193</page.no><name role="metadata">Entsch, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ENTSCH</name><name.id>7K6</name.id><electorate>Leichhardt</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a great pleasure for me to participate today in this address-in-reply debate. I am certainly proud to stand here as the federal member for Leichhardt for the fourth time and, along with my colleague the member for Deakin, as part of the fourth Howard government. The Australian public has again given this government a clear mandate: continue with our policies and keep this country very strong economically and of course safe from terrorism. I believe the Howard government won its fourth term so convincingly because of its outstanding record in keeping our nation's economy thriving, and I was glad to see the member for Throsby actually acknowledging the strength of the economy at the moment.</para></talk.start><para>Despite economic troubles around the world, Australia has managed to continue to prosper, maintaining low unemployment and record low interest rates and continuing to reduce government debt. Our country remains the best-performing nation in the OECD. Our budget surplus of $8 billion in 2003-04—$3.5 billion higher than estimated at the time of the 2004-05 budget—again reflects the strength of the economy. The $96 billion debt that we inherited in 1996 has now been slashed to below $26 billion. That is a huge saving that we are generating in funds that it is not necessary to pay as the interest on that debt. Our unemployment rate as of only yesterday is 5.1 per cent nationally—the lowest in over 30 years—which is an outstanding performance. In Cairns, in my region, the unemployment rate has dropped to 4.7 per cent. Again, this is an outstanding statistic.</para><para>This last election brought many successes to my electorate, including ongoing funding for stage 3 of the development of the Cairns esplanade. There is $10 million to continue the boardwalk towards the international airport, $11.4 million for the Daintree rainforest and wet tropics, $5 million for the Daintree Coast Conservation Initiative, $1 million for further protection of the endangered cassowary and $5.4 million from the Natural Heritage Trust to help manage the wet tropics. There was also $40 million set aside to establish a marine and tropical research centre at James Cook University, to support very important research relating to the Great Barrier Reef and the tropical rainforest. At this stage, I would like to say a special thanks to Russell Reichelt from the CRC Reef Research Centre, John McIntyre from TTNQ and Daniel Gschwind, the Chief Executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council, who worked very closely with me in securing this funding. This came about after the CRC for Reef Research and the CRC for Rainforest Futures were unsuccessful in their bids for ongoing funding. </para><para>There were many who were critical of government for not allowing that funding to continue, even though both bids clearly did not meet the criteria under the CRC guidelines. These three people realised that immediately and were prepared to come in and work very closely with me and, as a direct result of their endeavours, we now have a new $100 million program that is directly focused on public good CRC endeavours that have an environment focus. They are taken out of the normal CRC process. The first $40 million goes to its establishment. So to those three gentlemen I say, `Excellent work'.</para><para>We are starting to see the first of our young doctors being trained at James Cook University, through a medical facility that this government established some years ago. We are now taking the next step, with another $12 million committed to a new veterinary science facility at James Cook University to be established in Townsville and with links to the Cairns campus. It will focus on tropical agriculture. What is even more important and more significant for regional areas is that it is looking at establishing a satellite facility at Malanda, in the tablelands, for large animals and tropical agriculture. This new facility will provide a unique focus on tropical animal husbandry and diseases in tropical agriculture.</para><para>There is also $6 million over four years to provide 50 new veterinary science places in 2006, rising to 137 in 2009. This is going to provide some outstanding opportunities not only for young people interested in studying veterinary science in our region but also for students from the South-East Asian region who want to study. They will be able to contribute to our community and study in Far North Queensland. It is a great benefit for our region to get more and more foreign students accessing our facilities, paying full fees and bringing the additional resources for accommodation and other living costs that they distribute around our community while they are there.</para><para>There was also $6 million towards the Great Green Way project, a tourist initiative linking Townsville to Cairns. The tourism industry in Far North Queensland already employs some 12,000 people. Tourism initiatives are vitally important, with 16.4 per cent of the total Far North Queensland work force being employed in tourism. With the Great Green Way initiative, we will see these figures start to grow. The tourism industry provides some 40 per cent of our income in Far North Queensland. You can see how important that industry is to us.</para><para>On the education side, there have also been some great initiatives welcomed in my electorate, with the government boosting training in areas of skill shortages through packages designed to encourage more young people to take up trades. While Minister Nelson was in my region, he announced that the $800 tool kit for new apprentices and the living away from home allowance will be extended to third-year apprentices. These are absolutely vital for young people in my area, given that a lot of them come down from the Torres Strait, Cape York and remote areas. To get extra financial support while living away from home provides an additional incentive for apprentices to finish their training.</para><para>One of the 24 Australian technical colleges to be established will be in Townsville, which will be great and certainly something we can access. I am certainly looking forward to seeing these colleges as they are rolled out. Once these 24 colleges have been established, I will certainly be putting in a bid for a 25th, hopefully in Cairns. The government commitment to direct funds for infrastructure through the P&amp;Cs is a great way to fund schools, to stop cost shifting in state governments, allowing for the refurbishment of classrooms, the installation of airconditioning, the upgrade of tuckshop facilities et cetera, and will give the parents of children attending these schools a much greater say, assisting them in raising funds for particular initiatives. It would have been of particular benefit to the school community in Cairns North, one of the oldest schools in Cairns, that had been run down appallingly. However, the Beattie Labor government decided to shut the school down on 10 December, to sell it off to developers for housing or some other real estate venture, rather than allow it to continue as an educational facility—a bitter disappointment for many of the parents of children who attended that school. </para><para>When you come from a regional area you cannot make any comment in this place without raising the issue of roads. I think that the government's $12.5 billion land transport initiative through AusLink is outstanding. Leichhardt is certainly going to be a significant benefactor of that initiative. Initially none of the money allocated to Queensland was to be set aside for flood-proofing a particularly difficult area south of Cairns on the Bruce Highway at Tully. Unfortunately, the state government saw this as a low priority and suggested that it was part of an eight-year plan. We disagreed and, with some outstanding support from the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Mr Lloyd, we were able to quarantine $80-odd million from Queensland for the upgrading of that area.</para><para>When that road is flooded and the road transporters stop, it has an impact on all communities north of Tully, not only from a tourism perspective but also from a supply perspective. It is an almost annual event. We thought the $80 million might have fixed the problem, because the state government suggested that was what it would cost, but after we allocated the money we found they had done no planning whatsoever. We then had to supply another $1½ million to the state government and ask that they initiate a plan immediately so we could get the thing started. Rather than the three years that they were suggesting, we encouraged them to get the plan done in 12 months.</para><para>Again, I thought that would have been the end of the issue but, unfortunately, when dealing with Mr Beattie and his Labor government you have to get used to surprises. After all this had taken place we found out that he had decided not to go ahead with this because he does not want to sign up to our national building code. He has decided that the community of Tully and communities further north are secondary, in his consideration, to making sure that he does not offend the unions on issues such as right of access to the road construction site, union membership et cetera.</para><para>The situation has reached something of a stalemate now, but I am hoping that Mr Beattie will take some leadership from South Australia and, as of yesterday, from Victoria. The Victorian government have signed up to the national code. I now hope that Queensland will be the third government to sign up so that construction of this road can commence. It is vital infrastructure. The Queensland government cannot afford to start playing around and engaging in this sort of nonsense. I call on Mr Beattie to sign up and get the money flowing without any further delay.</para><para>Some $30 million has been spent on our Southern Access Road. The recent three-laning of the area between the Sheehy and Foster roads was completed just before Christmas. However, I am disturbed that the federal department of transport advises me that there have been no further submissions for ongoing work in that area. It is a stop and start situation where people are continually being inconvenienced rather than having continuity of flow in getting the job finished. I am already pursuing the Queensland Department of Main Roads and saying: `Get out there and have a look at it. Have a bit of vision. Think towards tomorrow. Don't wait until the problem is upon us and then blame the federal government for not fixing it. Get it up front so that we can get the resources to get the job finished.' </para><para>I was also very pleased to receive confirmation of funding for the Peninsula Development Road. Maintaining that as a road of national importance is vital for the Cape York community. While some $5 million has already been allocated to that road as the federal government's contribution, I would encourage the state government to consider continuing the upgrading of that highway and committing more resources to it. The Australian government, through the Roads of National Importance program, will contribute 50 per cent to all ongoing projects, so I ask them to continue to plan for the future, thinking of the needs of the Cape York residents.</para><para>The allocation of $500,000 to Russett Park residents for flood-proofing was welcomed by the community. The Mareeba Shire Council have stepped up to the plate and have put their $500,000 on the table. The only one that is not prepared to contribute is, again, the Beattie Labor government. The community are absolutely outraged, as are the council. I can assure you that, after all the work that we have put in, I am very angry that the state government is still reluctant to contribute. We have not lost a life this year. We nearly lost one last year and the year before that. I think we have lost two lives so far—the lives of people trying to cross that road in a flood. It is vital that the state Labor government steps up and meets its commitments. I have to say that funding for the Black Spot and Roads to Recovery programs has been outstanding in my electorate. I look forward to both those programs continuing because they are of immense benefit.</para><para>The government is certainly going to pursue its longstanding policy on the full sale of Telstra. I totally support that policy. We came to government in 1996, and 90 per cent of people in my electorate now have access to mobile phone coverage, internet and a whole range of services that they could only have dreamt of. We have recently extended mobile phone coverage to places as remote as Badu Island, Sabai Island and Murray Island in the middle of the Torres Strait. Sabai is within three kilometres of mainland Papua New Guinea and they can now talk on a mobile phone—something that could never have been dreamt of a few years ago. There has been a huge benefit, as there has been with the extension of television and radio right through these areas which a couple of years ago could only dream of having those services available to them.</para><para>There were a lot of initiatives in the last budget in relation to families, carers and women. There have also been huge initiatives in relation to health. There was the increase in the rebate for GP consultations from 85 to 100 per cent and a number of other initiatives. In mental health, some $50 million will be provided over four years to provide assistance to GPs in the detection of depression. There is some $30 million for better outcomes for mental health care initiatives and some $30 million for beyondblue, a national, independent not-for-profit organisation which addresses the issue of depression. I think the events of the last week or so highlight the desperate need for further mental health initiatives. This funding will certainly start to address some of these issues, but I think a lot more has to be done in this area. I hope the outcome of the inquiry into this recent event will be a catalyst for both the states and the Australian government to start to look at greater investment in what I believe is an area of absolutely desperate need: mental health and, in particular, schizophrenia. I hope that some positives start to come out of this inquiry. It has certainly highlighted the shortfall. </para><para>In July we will, of course, see the abolition of ATSIC. Given that I have in my electorate the third largest Indigenous population in Australia, I can tell you that the overwhelming majority of Indigenous people on the ground and in remote communities are watching the clock and waiting for the day. They just cannot wait for it to come. It cannot come quickly enough.</para><para>I would like to finish by having a look at some of the initiatives that were proposed by the Labor Party at the last election. The Labor Party are wondering why they lost—and lost so soundly. You only have to have a look at their policies in Cape York. They are now talking about locking up the cape. They are talking about restricting economic opportunities. They signalled that they would be cutting legal assistance for Cape York farmers, fishers and miners engaged in native title disputes and throw the whole native title system into doubt. Their environmental policies were clearly designed to win votes.</para><para>The ideologists in the latte set in Sydney and Melbourne have no consideration for the residents of Cape York. They talked about buying back land for conservation and creating new World Heritage areas, but nowhere did they commit to security of tenure for the existing residents. When will Labor learn that the residents of Cape York, the Daintree and, for that matter, other areas are an absolutely integral part of managing and protecting the environment? If you lock up these areas there will be no-one left to manage the weeds, control the feral animals and manage and protect the sensitive environment there. The Labor Party's policies in Far North Queensland were led by Senator Jan McLucas and her socialist left faction, which once held significant power in that area. However, the Labor Party's results in this election were the lowest ever—and you can see why. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>197</page.no><name role="metadata">Vamvakinou, Maria, MP</name><name role="display">Ms VAMVAKINOU</name><name.id>00AMT</name.id><electorate>Calwell</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the member for Deakin for having the courage to admit that he, like me and so many other members of the House, is a latte lover. Leaving the latte lovers alone and getting down to business, I would like to begin my speech in the address-in-reply debate by placing on record my gratitude to the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Hon. Neil Andrew, who was a wonderful Speaker. I had an opportunity to get to know him better when I was part of a delegation to Chile a couple of years ago, which he led. I wish Neil and his wife, Carolyn, a happy retirement. It is a hard-earned retirement and I know they are looking forward to it. As a new member, I found him as Speaker very helpful, inviting and encouraging.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the voters of the federal electorate of Calwell, who have given me the privilege and the honour to represent them in this place for a second term. It is difficult to believe that three years have passed and that I now no longer have the cover of being a new member. As I enter my second term, I presume it is expected that I have mastered the art of a lot of things, but I would like to reflect on my previous term. There are two particularly rewarding experiences that I had. The most significant one for me was the private member's motion on breast prostheses that I moved in my first year here. It highlighted the difficulties that lots of women had once they were diagnosed with breast cancer and the difficulty in acquiring adequate prostheses after a mastectomy. </para><para>That private member's motion, of course, led to my party, the Labor Party, adopting a policy for a nationally funded program for the provision of breast prostheses for women who have had mastectomies. I would like to say again that such a program would address what is still an unacceptable situation which exists with state hospital budgets that do not provide adequate and sufficient breast prostheses for women with breast cancer. That problem continues to exist and will continue to exist until such time as this government or a future government acts to establish a national, dedicated, fully funded program specifically for the provision of breast prostheses.</para><para>My other significant experience was the work that I did as the Australian delegate to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. This work and experience gave me an incredible insight into the work of parliamentarians from around the world. I can only say that the experiences and the knowledge I gained were invaluable on a personal level and certainly on a professional level.</para><para>During the 2004 election and in the months since, we have heard much talk about family values and the importance of family life. As a woman who is both a member of parliament and a mother, I want to say that I am encouraged when I hear this discussion because that means that perhaps the political culture and traditions of this place may start to better accommodate family life. I have found that change has occurred and is occurring. It is happening slowly, but I can say that, if we as parliamentarians seek in the course of our jobs to improve the lives of Australian families, I think we need to lead by example.</para><para>It is very important to our overall democratic process that, as individuals and members of parliament, we are seen to be practising the values that we want to promote to the broader community. So I look forward to the debates around family life and values, and in particular I look forward to the examination of government policies on the basis of how they impact not just on families but on community relations as a whole, because, although the traditional family is the bedrock of our society, we have to accept the fact that there exist many different family structures, all worthy of our acknowledgement, all worthy of legitimacy and certainly all worthy of our support.</para><para>No one political party has a monopoly on family values, and I certainly will not be tolerating any situation where self-appointed representatives or advocates of `family' are allowed to operate from a narrow basis and seek to impose or mandate their views on the general community. This would be a danger to our democratic society and to the cohesion of our diverse and multicultural society.</para><para>I would like to thank the people who have made my re-election possible. Firstly, I want to thank my own family, whose understanding of my working hours and long stays in Canberra is always appreciated by me, although sometimes resented by them. I am sure that we all agree that being a member of parliament and travelling to Canberra is indeed very difficult on family life and, in particular, on young children. Obviously, as MPs we make a lot of sacrifices. I do not think the general public appreciate just how many sacrifices we do make, but I could not do this job without the support of my husband and, I guess, to a certain extent his sacrifices. In addition to his role as an academic he has taken on many new roles and I think that he has come through with flying colours. So as a former teacher I give him a big gold star. He has done extremely well and I could not do this job without his support and encouragement. </para><para>I would also like to thank my electorate staff who are very important to me and to all of us—Joanne, Ismail, Brendan, Ros, Helen, Gulay and Bronwyn. I know there are a lot of them but believe me we are operating within the frameworks here. I would also like to thank those who have moved on—Elliot and Jason. I thank them all for their tireless efforts during the time that they served in our office and during the election campaign. Of course, I want to thank all of the people who make up the Calwell FEA and the Calwell campaign committee. It is not possible to stand here without the support of these people. I am extremely pleased and honoured to have them working with me and I want to continue to work with them in the interests of the people of Calwell.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phillip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Barresi</name></talker><para>—Particularly, the people of Greenvale!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMT</name.id><name role="metadata">Vamvakinou, Maria, MP</name><name role="display">Ms VAMVAKINOU</name></talker><para>—Indeed, particularly the people of Greenvale. Calwell is a very diverse electorate. It is a culturally diverse and multifaith electorate with mixed demographics. I know many individuals and groups well because many formed part of my old electorate but there are lots of new groups that I look forward to getting to know and to forming relationships with. Following the last federal redistribution some 61 per cent of voters in the new seat of Calwell voted in the new seat for the first time. So the challenge for me is that I have a significantly changed electorate and, as a result, the electorate that I spoke about in my inaugural speech in 2001 has now become very different.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the south there still remain the familiar, and I must say the much loved, urban communities of Broadmeadows, Tullamarine and Westmeadows. Many of the families in these suburbs earn their living working in either the transport industries at Tullamarine or in the manufacturing facilities of companies like Ford, Nestle or Yakka. In the east of my electorate are the communities of Greenvale, Craigieburn and Roxburgh Park. These communities have many young families and they have been typified as the mortgage belt of my electorate. The families in these communities struggle with high levels of household debt. This is a worrying phenomenon, as Australia has the highest rate of personal and domestic debt in the world. With their large mortgages those people are very vulnerable to interest rate rises. I guess to a certain extent this vulnerability led to the success of the government's interest rate scare campaign during the last federal election. These families will, however, continue to endure the anxieties and pressures that inevitably come with high mortgages. And, with the Prime Minister's refusal during question time yesterday to guarantee that interest rates will not rise, I suspect that many of these families will continue to live in a state of anxiety and difficulty as they try to negotiate family budgets.</para><para>Craigieburn is a new addition to my electorate. I have spent a lot of time in Craigieburn getting to know the people and the community. In particular, I would like to note the great work of Rita McMillin of Selwyn House. She works tirelessly to run this fantastic local community centre. Craigieburn is an old community which is now surrounded by a fast growing outer urban sprawl. With more growth predicted—I think we are expecting 15,000 new people to move into Craigieburn within the next 10 years—the challenge for all of us will be to ensure that the infrastructure keeps up with community growth. In particular in Craigieburn I would like to thank the local church organisations such as the Brotherhood of St Lawrence and the Anglican Church, who form the backbone of community services, and I look forward to continue working with the church groups in assisting them with the wonderful work that they do with the community. In addition, the recently formed Craigieburn Progress Association is another great organisation and another step in community building. I want to thank Spencer and Brenda Davis for their initiative and the amount of work and commitment they have put into establishing the Craigieburn Progress Association. </para><para>Finally, in the west of my electorate lies the communities of Bulla and Sunbury. Bulla is a very small community of only 380 people, but Sunbury is a substantial new addition to the federal seat of Calwell. Sunbury has grown from being a small regional town centre to having a population of about 35,000 and growing. Sunbury is a beautiful community, a beautiful town, and its inhabitants insist that it is well known as the birthplace for the `Ashes'. It is also becoming very well known for its wineries and the production of some of the very best Australian wines. The more established wineries of Goonawarra and Craiglee and an abundance of smaller boutique wineries make this area an attractive place for those who wish to invest in one of Australia's fastest growing and most successful export industries. In fact, yesterday I had a meeting with a delegation from the European Union and they made the point that one in every second bottle of wine they open at the EU—I presume at dinners and so forth—is an Australian wine. So the success of our wine is phenomenal and we should be proud of that. I am certainly proud to have Sunbury in my electorate contributing to this phenomenal success.</para><para>I have met a lot of wonderful people in Sunbury. There are many great people who live and work there and who are active in the community. I acknowledge the fantastic work in particular of Ray Scrace and the Sunbury Men's Drop-In Centre who operate a woodworking shop for older male residents at the local community health centre. This facility gives many of the older residents a daily sense of purpose. The drop-in centre helps them tackle the ever-increasing problem of loneliness and depression which many older men face, whether it is because they have lost partners or are coping with chronic or debilitating illnesses. This is a great problem in the community of Sunbury.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 1.00 p.m. to 4.01 p.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMT</name.id><name role="metadata">Vamvakinou, Maria, MP</name><name role="display">Ms VAMVAKINOU</name></talker><para>—Before the suspension of the sitting I was speaking about issues of concern to my electorate of Calwell and, in particular, to the town of Sunbury. I was congratulating Ray Scrace and his men's drop-in centre for the work that they do—the centre accommodates men who are looking for a place to drop in and perhaps do some woodwork or have a bit of a chat—and making the point that mental health is a serious issue, not just for the broader Australian community but for my electorate and for Sunbury. I am very pleased about the government's election promise committing $110 million to mental health awareness—I certainly look forward to that, as I know we all do. This issue requires attention at the highest level. Mental health afflicts the young and the old, men and women alike. It is an issue I took a keen interest in in the previous parliament and I will continue to take an interest in it in this parliament. While I am addressing this issue I would like to congratulate the Schizophrenia Friendship Group, which today launched a kit for our electorate offices and our staff. It is a wonderful kit that gives our staff an opportunity to understand constituents who may present with mental health symptoms.</para></talk.start></continue><para>While on the subject of Sunbury, I take the opportunity to thank Ted Jarrett from the Goonawarra Golf Club. Ted is an icon of the Sunbury community who works hard to support his club. His efforts are tireless. He is a man who, though at retirement age, is still dreaming big dreams for his community and, in particular, for the development and prosperity of his beloved golf club. I am honoured to accept the club's offer to be their patron. Even though I know almost nothing about golf, I look forward to the challenges that being patron will present to me. </para><para>As we enter this new term of parliament my electorate faces many of the challenges that are typical for communities in outer metropolitan areas across the nation. I will work hard, in partnership with my community and my constituents, to ensure that their concerns are brought to the attention of the parliament. The government now has the opportunity to address many of the key concerns and issues facing our nation, but its greatest challenge will be to do this by governing in the interests of all Australians. We in the opposition intend to keep a close watch on events in this place and we will do whatever is necessary on behalf of our electorates and in the national interest to ensure that the government is in fact governing for the interests of all Australians. I represent some 85,000 people, a majority of whom did not vote for the government. Nevertheless, their lives will be affected by policies that this government implements in the next three years, and I am certain that that effect will not always be beneficial or positive.</para><para>In my inaugural speech I spoke about my commitment to our multicultural community and to reconciliation with our Indigenous communities. Unfortunately, both issues have suffered serious setbacks in recent years. I would like to make the point that we have a responsibility to promote harmony and racial tolerance in a substantial way. In the life of this parliament I aim to lend my voice and support to the advancement of Indigenous issues. My electorate has large ethnic communities and a significant Indigenous population, with Calwell being on the land whose traditional owners are the Wurundjeri people of the Coolum nation. I am proud to say that the many and varied cultural groups in Calwell work well to demonstrate how strong community partnerships can advance their cause. In the case of the Indigenous community there is excellent work being done by Koori activists working with Dianella Community Health, Best Start and the Koori Education Centre in order to tackle education, health and social issues.</para><para>Earlier I mentioned family values and the concern I and others have about narrow interpretations of what constitutes a family or family values. I believe family values cannot be defined on the basis of religious principles alone; rather, family values are also impacted upon and defined by cultural and historical traditions and practices. I spoke of the contribution that multiculturalism has made to this country. Beyond language, food and culture lies a great tradition of family values that many Australians, and indeed governments and policymakers, can learn from. I think it is important that we learn from the family traditions of multicultural, multifaith Australia. I think we should learn from the values of the extended family and how collective living, and the responsibility of caring for each other beyond the nuclear family, can be of benefit to a society that it is all too focused on the individual.</para><para>At a time when relationships break down so quickly and catastrophically, and with the youth suicide rate climbing to a level that is unacceptable, I think that political parties such as Family First, and even the government, have a lot to learn from the family values of other faiths and cultures—because family values, as defined by many people, are not the monopoly of particular Christian denominations. These lessons could be taken from the homes—multicultural and multifaith—of Australian families, and especially from the family values of our newer communities and our emerging Muslim community. Many lessons could be learnt from the honest and hard-working multifaith families living in Meadow Heights and Dallas in my electorate and elsewhere across the country. If we want to look at how the family can bring some sense to this chaotic and insecure world we live in, let us look a little further into our own neighbours' backyards. Let us learn from them and listen to what they have to say. </para><para>In closing I would like again to thank the people of Calwell for giving me the opportunity to serve them in this parliament for a second term. I want to thank my colleagues, my friends and my own family for their assistance and the support that they have given me. I am very proud to represent the people of Calwell and I hope that I will be able to serve them well in the next three years. I take this opportunity also to welcome the new members to this parliament. I was a new member in the last term; I know that you face many challenges. It is a great learning curve but it is a great honour to serve people in this parliament—so welcome. For my part, I look forward to the challenges ahead for me and my electorate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>202</page.no><name role="metadata">Broadbent, Russell, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROADBENT</name><name.id>MT4</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the member for Calwell in this address-in-reply, particularly with regard to the family values that are common to all Australians, be they black, white or any other colour, whatever their background and wherever they come from. Like me, the member for Calwell represents a seat that has a diverse community. Being someone who comes from a regional area with a very high migrant background, I can identify with her and with her compassion for the community that she serves. We would all be well served if we took note of the address that has just been given to this House and invested in our communities the way that she has.</para></talk.start><para>My second remark with regard to the last speaker's address is that I was complimented by her in her welcome to new members. This is the third time that I have been a new member to this House. Unlike the member for Calwell, I have never been able to string two consecutive periods of representation together. She said she had been re-elected to this House and thanked the people of Calwell. The Leader of the Opposition said yesterday that if he had his way he would not mind having the Prime Minister's record rather than his own. I say to the member for Calwell that I would not mind your record instead of the record I am about to present to this House.</para><para>Much has happened since members began to speak in the debate on the address-in-reply to the Governor-General's speech. Later on I would particularly like to speak about the tsunami, the bushfires and the difficulties that the Australian community and the world community have faced and those that they have faced as one. I stand here today as a marginal seat member of this parliament, the member for McMillan for the second time, after an amazing victory over a very strong opponent from the Labor Party named Christian Zahra, who ran an excellent campaign and was highly regarded by the community. I wish him all the best in his future activities, as he represented the constituency of McMillan, particularly in the time from when I was defeated until I came back into this House, with distinction, energy and, in particular, youthfulness and determination.</para><para>I am not a hater of the opposition. I am not a hater of the Labor Party. In fact, I am someone who believes that we all have a contribution to make whichever party we come from. We all have a position and we all come from different backgrounds and, whatever the issues that we have to face as parliamentarians in this place as representatives of our community, we should always hold our opposition colleagues, our ministers and the people that work in this house in the highest regard for two reasons. One is that it is a very hard road to become a federal member of parliament. There is not one person here who has arrived on an easy train. The second is that we owe it to the broader community of Australia—we owe it to the nation—that we pay respect to one another so that they can then take that lead and respect one another in the broader community. In saying that, I mean that we can draw out the best from our parliamentary colleagues and the best from the people who work in this house, whatever the role that they play, whether it is the young person who is delivering newspapers to federal members' offices at half past six in the morning, the Clerk of the House or those representatives who make this house, this place of democracy, work. </para><para>After those few words I wish to indulge myself for just one moment and recognise that I did not get into the seat of McMillan on my own. I had supporting my campaign a man named Neville Goodwin, who came in with determination, desire and energy; Ken Smith MLA, the state member for the seat of Bass in Victoria; of course my family; Victorian senator Judith Troeth, who worked the electorate as a patron senator for six years of blood, sweat and tears until she came home with me victorious; and a group of young girls—Cara, Priscilla and Julie-Anne—who called themselves the A Team because they were the back-up, the information and research people and those who supplied the energy. They were the ones that supported me daily. They got up early in the morning; they were with me. I refer to the amazing band of Liberals in the seat of McMillan who decided to never give up and to keep on going and gave me another opportunity, another chance. I refer to Russ Street, who came into the campaign very early on and followed me right through to the finish on the night. I have paid tribute to Christian Zahra. I did that because, having been in so many campaigns, I know when somebody runs a good campaign and I know when someone is good at what they do. I know what I was up against when I took on this enormous task of trying to win back—as I note—this redistributed seat. Former member Barry Simon lost his seat of McMillan when it was redistributed and Korumburra was taken out of it. He lost it to Barry Cunningham. I think redistributions play a greater role in what happens in seats across Australia than the brilliance of members and their activities as candidates can ever attest. I know that, in the pitching and throwing that happens in politics in Australia, a redistribution can make all the difference.</para><para>Our campaign was very low key, and I thank all the people whom I have just named. They stuck together very closely. They were a very small team, but a very important team. Having lost four federal election campaigns and won three since 1983, and having more than 20 years of political activity, even I am amazed to be back here—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Quick</name></talker><para>—Lots of scars.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>MT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Broadbent, Russell, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROADBENT</name></talker><para>—Lots of scars—knowing I have taken three seats from Labor but having been defeated by Labor four times in the past.

It goes all the way down to beautiful Wilsons Promontory, to Wonthaggi and to Inverloch. My seat goes from the snow to the sea, from Mount Baw Baw all the way through to the ocean. As every member in this House will say, it is one of the most beautiful electorates that you could ever drive through. Members, you should take any opportunity to come to beautiful Gippsland and see our beautiful green hills, even at this time of year. We have had some lovely, refreshing rain. It has not been accepted by everybody with such glee, but it certainly has in our area. It is the most magnificent part of the world, and I feel honoured, blessed and openly thrilled to be the member for McMillan. </para><para>I do feel new. Even though I have been to this House three times before—I tried to get here in 1984 and 1987 but did not succeed—I feel new and fresh. I am sending a message out to other people that (1) you should never give up, but you have heard that before, and (2) it does not matter what age you are; it is how you think and the opportunities that you can grab that matter. To young people who would like to have a future as a federal or a state parliamentarian, I say take the chance when it comes. Never say: `I'm too young. I'm too old. I'm too tall. I'm too short. I haven't got enough hair,' or `I don't look good enough.' Forget that. If the opportunity arises and you have a heart to serve the people, come on down because this is the place for you to be.</para><para>There were issues in our campaign that made a difference. South Gippsland is a most beautiful area. Let me take you on a quick drive and swing you out of Melbourne until you get past the suburbs and into the Strzelecki Ranges and over towards Wilsons Prom, into that beautiful and pristine area where you come over the Foster hills and the whole vista of Wilsons Prom is spread out before you, with the beautiful ocean and the crystal clear waters. If the wind turbine companies have their way, as you look down that vista you will see row after row after row of wind turbines. The people in south Gippsland have said, `No, we don't want to change.' Without mentioning names, there are former Labor and Liberal politicians, including senators, living down there and they are all of one accord. It is a pristine community—a glorious place.</para><para>One of the members in the chamber now is from Tasmania. I visited that state because someone said it is Australia's best kept secret, and I did not know it until I went down there for a week and needed three weeks. It is so beautiful. You have to remember that south Gippsland is the closest thing there is to Tasmania. I am in the most south-easterly seat on the mainland. The rocks that are under me that have been there for thousands of years before we came along are the same rocks that are under Tasmania. It is the same string of mountains. So we are related by rocks, by beautiful hills and by pristine countryside.</para><para>People travel the world to find places just as I have described to you. It is a matter of sincere passion when I say to you that I am not going to sacrifice the beautiful coastline of Gippsland on the altar of renewable energy. In fact, I would be distraught if I—after all this time and after all the work—became the member responsible for the destruction of that area for the next 75 years by the placement of wind turbines on the coast. I know there are people on all sides of politics who are opposed to wind turbines in that area. There are plenty of places in Australia where people want turbines, but generally the community in south Gippsland has said, `We don't want them here. We don't want them on the access road to the promontory. We don't want them spread across Bald Hills. We don't want them spread across the Dollar Hills. We don't want them close to our coastline.'</para><para>If you went to any city people, say, in Victoria, and said, `Here's your pristine Brighton Beach,' or in Coogee and said, `We're just going to put up a few little wind turbines on Coogee Beach,' there would be an absolute uproar. Or the same would happen if someone wanted to put a row of wind turbines just outside Parliament House here so that we could run some power into the place—at the moment, we cannot even build a proper fence around it, but that is another issue for another time. I am pleading with the Greens, some of whom—named here—think that we should be selling wind turbines better because they are such beautiful things. Would this lady, who is a Green from somewhere, want them? You are going to say, `Not in my backyard—this is a nimby issue.' This is not a nimby issue. It is not an issue of substance—such as the Pakenham bypass, interest rates, the lowest unemployment in 10 years, but there is still more to be done in the seat of McMillan. This is a burning issue for people. The way things are going, it may take five minutes to erect these wind turbines—they said they can be put up very quickly—but they will be there for 25 years. So it could take a generation to put them up, a generation that puts up with them and a generation to pull them down. </para><para>When I started this exercise, I thought, `This is a pretty clean, green way to produce power.' I have moved completely away from that, not from becoming a candidate for that seat but from learning what wind turbines are all about. On further investigation I have found that they are not as efficient or effective and that they disrupt the power source. There is a real problem with them. I am going to be one of those members—I am sorry, members who are gathered here today—who will talk and talk about wind turbines until I stop them from ruining the Gippsland coastline, until I can go back to the people there and say, `I represented you reasonably and fairly. Look, there are no wind turbines on the Gippsland coastline. It is there for your children.'</para><para>The immediate concern is the declining land values because of wind turbines being located next door. The issue is splitting communities because those who are going to benefit from wind turbines want them and those who are going to have their life and amenity depleted by wind turbines do not want them.</para><para>Without talking about noise, without talking about the amenity of the area, without talking about the visual and landscape aspects, without talking about the planning aspects, without talking about being railroaded by state governments, without talking about subsidies for wind turbines which, without the subsidies, would not even be going up, the simple message I want to send today is this—and my staff will be furious because I have not stuck to the notes they gave me for my address to the House today—I know that the heart of the people is to save that pristine area for future generations.</para><para>I am excited and proud to identify with the government, the opposition and the people of Australia in our response to the events of Boxing Day last year, and I know that all members of this House support every effort the government put in. I am sure that every member of this House was enamoured, amazed and taken aback by the generosity of the Australian people in their efforts on behalf of people who have had their lives destroyed—the many hundreds of thousands who were killed. I must leave this message with you: my fear on Boxing Day night and the next day was that we were going to be faced with thousands of Australians killed. I do identify with those who have lost—and there have been many—but how blessed is this nation that we lost so few when we could have lost so many, and that we were in some way protected? It has just amazed me every time I have seen the footage of the families that have lost and the stories of the miraculous escapes. The Australian people and the people in my electorate have raised so much money and thrown their heart and soul at the devastation that has happened after the tsunami. </para><para>I am proud this day to be a resident of that part of Victoria which is connected to Tasmania by rock. I want to protect the pristine community. I am proud today to be a new member in this House and to participate in the address-in-reply to the Governor-General's speech. I am proud today to say that I am part of a government that has responded in this way to the needs of those who are least able to care for themselves at this most difficult time. I am also proud to say, in response to the nine deaths in another bushfire in South Australia, that we were able to respond quickly. This nation has now trained its organisations, public servants and authorities to respond quickly. The first people into Aceh were Australians at all levels. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to bring this to the attention of the House today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>206</page.no><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr QUICK</name><name.id>AV5</name.id><electorate>Franklin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It seems a long time ago that we gathered in the Senate to hear the Governor-General deliver his speech on the opening of parliament.

It is great to be back here for the fifth time as the federal member for Franklin. It is something of a record. The Labor Party only ever won four elections in a row in Franklin, and that was way back in the 1940s when Mr Frost was the federal member for Franklin. Winning the seat in 2004 meant I was lucky enough to win five in a row, and so set the bar a little higher. I, like all other members, would like to thank all the people who worked tirelessly on the campaign. I have always advocated that, once you are re-elected, you start on the next campaign and you structure your three years as the federal member so that the people you look after are catered for—their every whim and demand are usually looked after as best as you can by you and your wonderful staff—and when the 33 days of madness comes along you are not swept up by all the excitement, you do not pour thousands of letters into the post office and then wonder why people are disillusioned with you. I have never intended, in the five campaigns that I have contested, to spend a dray load of money (a) because I do not have it and (b) the punters are not stupid, as I have said. With all the stuff that is stuck in letterboxes in a normal week, let alone what is put in there during the election campaign, why would they bother to read it? A grassroots campaign has always been my strategy, and it has been successful so far in five terms.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I would like to pay my compliments to Henry Finnis, my Liberal Party opponent.

Henry, to his credit, ran a very creditable campaign—a very clean, policy driven campaign—but he was unsuccessful. Over that period of 33 days—it was actually 42 days with the extra week we had—Henry and I got to know each other really well, and we have maintained that friendship since 9 October.</para><para>Five terms in this place is pretty good, I guess, but the frustrating thing is that I am on the other side where you cannot really do much and the bags of money are not necessarily thrown in your direction.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs Gash</name></talker><para>—Tasmania got a lot.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr QUICK</name></talker><para>—The funny thing is that it is always thrown at Bass, because Bass has always been a marginal seat and, for a little country town of about 60,000 or 70,000 people, more infrastructure resource money would be spent on it than any other comparable town in Australia. Unfortunately, the state Liberal and Labor parties do exactly the same. Braddon, Bass and northern Lyons are where government is decided—not in Denison and Franklin—and that is where all the money goes. That is where all the good roads are. That is where we have a plethora of hospitals and people are looked after and pork-barrelled beyond compare. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I have set myself a couple of things to try to sort out in my fifth term. One is the treatment of veterans. We have only three of the First World War Diggers left. What worries me is that, with so few left, we have not really learnt how to look after our veterans. In 1994 we took a whole lot of veterans back to Europe, and then I was privileged in 1995, on the 80th anniversary, to go over with a representative of each of the states and territories and Norfolk Island. That special part of our history was recognised, but the Diggers were suddenly gone. The same thing is happening with our Second World War guys. Most of them now are in their 80s. Their numbers are depleting by dozens virtually every day.</para><para>Some of our DVA officers really worry me. They seem to me to be happy to thwart and frustrate the veterans. I will give you an example. When a veteran wants to go to visit the doctor they have to go through some paperwork so that they can get a taxi refund and DVA does not think they are rorting the system. Each of us here has a Cabcharge card. We are accountable. Our Cabcharge account comes in every month, and we have to sign off to say we have done the right thing and we have not rorted the system. I know of instances where veterans in their 90s have forgotten to remind the doctor to put the date on a form—and when the form goes in it comes back. The veteran has to then go back to the doctor to fill out another form or to get the first form signed or dated. Why not give all these Second World War guys a bloody cabcharge? You can monitor it. They call the taxi, swipe their card, sign the form, go to the doctor and do the reverse on the way back. Are we just keeping the DVA people happy and shuffling paper?</para><para>I went to my local DVA office in Hobart, and said, `How many thousands of bits of paper do you send back to the veterans, who then go back to get it date stamped or signed by the doctor, most of whom are racing around like headless chooks?' and they said, `Thousands of them.' God knows how many of these forms, around Australia, are going backwards and forwards and costing more money when there is a simple solution. We are not talking about a lot of people. Give them a Cabcharge card each. It could easily be monitored by the department, and all the paperwork is gone. We are supposed to have a paperless society, for God's sake. Something as simple as that would relieve all the tension. I say to the DVA: your job there is to look after the veterans, not thwart them and frustrate them. Many of them have gone through being either a POW in Japan or a POW in Germany. And there is another issue. We have never given those guys or their families $25,000. I can tell you for sure that a lot of the trauma that they went through in Germany was just as bad as the punishment, in lots of cases, under the Japanese. We gave the 16 Korean POWs their $25,000—but `stick it up your jumper' to the ones who were in Europe. They have some terrible stories to tell. I say to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs: have a look at some of the DVA offices and think about a Cabcharge card.</para><para>While we are talking about DVA, it is the 90th anniversary of Gallipoli this year—a really special time. It is special to me because my dad was there as a young 18-year-old with the 7th Battalion. He managed to survive that and then go over to France—and on 19 July 1916 he was one of the 5,335 who got absolutely hammered at Fromelle. He came home an invalid at 19. I would like to think that some of us could go over there. As many of us who do want to go and who can pay our way could have some arrangement as Australian government representatives. I know the minister is going to go, the PM will go, Kim Beazley will probably go and the shadow defence minister will go; but I think we as a parliament ought to make a symbolic pilgrimage—as many of us as possible. We are not going to be here. Parliament is not going to be sitting. The government, through the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister for Defence, should say, `We are going to charter a couple of Qantas planes, and all those who want to go will pay their way.' We have thousands of frequent flyer points, travel entitlements and study leave. Let us organise something rather than suddenly seeing in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, the <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>or the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> that a little select group of people are going over there and no-one else is involved. Let us open it up to each and every one of us to go over, because there are only three of the First World War guys left. Let us make this, the 90th anniversary, very special. </para><para>Honourable members would know that we had a few hassles in Tassie: we lost a couple of seats. We lost Sid Sidebottom, the member for Braddon, and also Michelle O'Byrne, the member for Bass. We had a bit of a bunfight about the forests and some of us had some rather nasty things to say about our state Premier. You would be happy to know that we have kissed and made up. We kissed and made up over the tsunami appeal—strange times, and strange times bring people together. I would like to put on the public record that the whole forest issue in Tasmania needs to be sorted out once and for all. It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister went over and spoke to the cheering timber workers, saying, `I'm going to sort the problem out. I promise you 170,000 hectares will be locked away. You're not going to lose your jobs and everything will be fine.' He said he would send Senator Ian Macdonald or one of the other senators down to sort the mess out and it would all be done before Christmas.

The honourable member opposite says a whole lot of things, but we have had several visits from the minister responsible, the senator, and nothing has changed. I would say to the people of Tasmania: I think you have been conned. You have been shown the old sleight of hand card trick. The sad thing about the whole forest debate is that it has been going on for far too long. We have been gazing at our navels, we almost know the name of every tree in Tasmania, and Tasmanians are sick and tired of the whole issue. Let us put it aside and get on with some of the other issues that are just as important.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the things that I would like to mention is the issue of Indigenous health. The Australian Medical Association came out and made statements about how terrible it all was. It almost seems like a yearly event. I was lucky enough to be on the House committee that did a report into Indigenous health called <inline font-style="italic">Health is life</inline>. It was an excellent report. People extolled it as the blueprint to solve Indigenous health. The government responded almost four or five years ago, but one wonders whether anybody has the backbone to really get involved with the states and territories to ensure that their various health, education and housing ministers and also the local government authorities are putting the money where it should be spent. Today we had a bit of a debate about some of the money that is thrown around at election time. Some of it seems to be highly desirable; other parts of it seem to be a waste of time, energy and effort in an attempt to purchase a seat. Indigenous health can be resolved and it can be sorted out, but someone has to grasp the nettle and say, `We are going to do it,' because if you wander around Australia you see that it is in an appalling state of affairs. </para><para>Another issue is substance abuse. We are seeing in our newspapers almost daily the effect of cannabis on the mental health of so many of our young people and also people generally across our society. Once again, the then House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs put out, in August 2003, an excellent report called <inline font-style="italic">Road</inline><inline font-style="italic">to</inline><inline font-style="italic">recovery</inline>. I am sad to say that the government has not responded to the heaps and heaps of recommendations. Some of the states are taking this into their own hands, and I would like to compliment the Victorian government for its introduction of random drug testing. That had a few bugs to start with, but that is now accepted to be the first and the best way of trying to catch those who are partaking of such substances. To its credit, the government of Tasmania has decided to follow. But why do we still have to have this railroad gauge mentality? Why can't we have a national approach to these issues? Why can't we say that we are going to do this nationally, rather than each state coming along and saying, `We'll try it,' and then we do it? For goodness sake, Victoria led the way with random breath tests, 0.05 and seat belts and all the rest of the states were drawn kicking and screaming along to do it.</para><para>We need a national approach. We are a national parliament. If it was up to me I would get rid of all the states and have a national approach, a regional approach. Let's hear some of this stuff being expounded up here. I do not give a toss whether it is a Liberal or a Labor federal government, as long as someone gets off their whatsit and does some of these things. For God's sake, we have a national weights system. Do we have a national time system? No. If you are the Queensland Premier or the Western Australian Premier or the Tasmanian Premier you have your own time over summer. For God's sake, China has got one time zone, a national time zone: Beijing time. We have got all these issues and we are pussyfooting around. Let's do something as a national parliament to solve some of these issues. I know they might sound peripheral and airy-fairy but, for God's sake, some of them really impact on people in our community.</para><para>Another issue I would like to speak about briefly is the issue of carers. This is another group of people who are unsung, who are saving our governments—nation, state and local—millions and millions of dollars. Do they get any real recognition? Occasionally they do, and we have National Carers Day and we all go and pay tribute to them. But when you talk to carers you should ask them about some of the Centrelink hassles. For God's sake, we need to start resolving some of these and ironing out some of the issues for people who are carers. They are operating on a shoestring and having to fight Centrelink. The bureaucracy has gone mad, for goodness sake. Let's really recognise them by giving them what they really deserve.</para><para>Finally, in my last minute and 43 seconds, I want to talk about the issue of child care. As an ex-teacher I say to the child-care industry: `We undervalue you. We underpay you. You are in most cases providing the first foundation stone for our young people. We do not have a national registration or a national training regime. We do not pay you a decent wage.' For goodness sake, let's look at that issue. In the next three years, those opposite and we must work together with our state colleagues to ensure that we have a national framework. Community based child care and for-profit child care can work together, but they need to be paid properly and they need to have training. And we need to get away from early childhood teachers in the state system saying: `You're worthless. We're the first teachers, and you're just doing the babysitting and the mickey mouse stuff.' It is a total educative process. </para><para>As I said, it is great to be back for my fifth term. It is great to see many of my friends on the other side whom I love and admire and respect. Hopefully the 150 of us can work together in this wonderful place to ensure that once this three-year term is over we can look back and say, `We've made a difference.'</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>210</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will start my contribution to the address-in-reply debate by expressing my great honour and gratitude to the people of Gilmour for their confidence, friendship and guidance in returning me as a member. I am grateful for the opportunity and for being permitted to continue representing them in this House. I would also like to thank Martin Laverty and David Smith and all my campaign team for their trust and confidence in me. Now the work really starts. Among the first of our campaign promises was that this government would introduce institutions for excellence in trade skills. Already expressions of interest for 24 regional areas have been called for throughout Australia. The Illawarra is one of those regions, and as the Shoalhaven is part of the Illawarra I can assure residents that the Shoalhaven City Council and industry have already lodged an expression of interest.</para></talk.start><para>The Shoalhaven has many unique advantages to offer and a great opportunity to bring social and economic benefits to a region that the New South Wales Carr government is obviously leaving behind. I see two specialty areas that would be ideal in developing a synergistic component to complement our local industrial base. Those areas are the composite industry—fibreglass, carbon fibre, Kevlar and so on—and electrical engineering and avionics. Members may be aware that Nowra has a naval base, HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Albatross</inline>, supporting naval air operations. It was once the headquarters of the Fleet Air Arm and so has a long and illustrious tradition in supporting military avionics.</para><para>Nowra also has a vibrant boatbuilding industry which will complement trade training facilities when established. The boatbuilding industry has a strong export focus and many of the international racing yachts manufactured in this country and exported to Asia and Europe are manufactured in Nowra. The synergy between the aviation industry and the boatbuilding industry with regard to composites would provide a firm foundation for a curriculum to be offered. This curriculum would also support the automotive industry, which, in recent times, as all of us would realise, has been increasingly orientated towards composite materials both in the original equipment and in the repair automotive sectors.</para><para>The defence industry capability around Nowra has grown in recent years. Many of the international defence companies are represented in Nowra, thanks to the Howard government fostering the defence industry and to the foresight of Shoalhaven City Council to encourage those industries to be established in our electorate. For years those in the industry and business sector have been discussing with Shoalhaven City Council the problem of skills shortages and the amount of headhunting that exists. It is a well-known trend that the Australian defence department trains its people well and industry is not backward in poaching this expertise at the expense of the Australian taxpayer. I should add here that as a former business employer I am fully committed to seeing employers made responsible for the training of their employees so that all can share in the benefits. </para><para>Shoalhaven City Council is one of the first councils to put their money where their mouth is by putting on additional trainers and apprentices, and I commend it for that. Within the Shoalhaven, over 500 employers currently participate in a vocational education program with local high schools. In addressing some of the skills shortages in this aviation industry, one local registered training organisation, Aerospace Training Services, has developed a course approved by the New South Wales Board of Studies as part of the higher school certificate program. It offers this to local students in both the Shoalhaven and the Wollongong areas and is undertaken at the Australian Aviation Museum located at HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Albatross</inline>. This is just one example that is addressing our dire skills shortages.</para><para>Discussions have already ensued between Shoalhaven City Council and the University of Wollongong, who have a campus in West Nowra whose creation was made possible by this federal government. All are very keen about the prospect of such a facility being available in the Shoalhaven, as the present education precinct would auger well for a technical college, and commencing next year a medical school—again, fully funded by the government. We have a TAFE college with in excess of 4,000 students and there is the recently announced Sealab, now known as the Shoalhaven Marine and Freshwater Centre. All are located in the university precinct. So, Mr Deputy Speaker, you can see why we would like to add a technical college to the site to work in conjunction with our high schools. A meeting has been called to gather all our expertise to present a united approach. This brings me to another promise made by me that I would investigate the possibility of training for nurses, especially in aged care and how that could interact with our medical school. I will be discussing this with the university, the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Education, Science and Training.</para><para>Where to from here? As far as the electorate of Gilmore is concerned, I can report a genuine atmosphere of confidence. Even those who may not have voted for us realise that Australia and Gilmore are doing pretty well. It really came home to me last week when some of the training network providers claimed they had difficulty in filling places for Work for the Dole as people were actually working. Today people seem to be more satisfied with their lot, and there is a distinct absence of apprehension about the future. I am heartened by the many positive statements people have expressed to me recently, suggesting they have faith in the direction in which we are going.</para><para>The Shoalhaven, Kiama and the Southern Highlands have been rediscovered. People want to live, work and play here. Yet one of the greatest obstacles to encouraging growth was the lack of job opportunities and the absence of comprehensive and modern services. This is changing with more and more commercial enterprises setting up shop, creating employment opportunities for young families.</para><para>Without a doubt, the most significant project we have going is the construction of main road 92 or the Shoalhaven Highway from Nowra to Canberra. The benefits that this link to the economic centres of south-east Australia will bring to the region are enormous. Such a link will have the effect of redistributing traffic flows of freight so that, instead of bypassing the South Coast, they will be able to add yet another economic centre to their routes. Yet after announcing $34 million worth of funding as far back as 1998, six years ago, progress remains slow. The state government continue to drag their heels seemingly with disinterest at cultivating this new economic hub. Rather, their emphasis has been on preserving the status quo, discouraging growth through inaction and hesitation six years after the deal was made. </para><para>So many opportunities have been lost. No wonder that people lose faith. What should have been done was to build the road together with the eastern gas pipeline and the Telstra fibre optic cable. Now of course—you guessed it—cables et cetera have to be moved at a huge cost to the taxpayer. However, being the eternal optimist, I am pleased to report that the work will be commencing in 2005. It is almost as if there is a reluctance on the part of the state government—but for reasons best known to them. As if to emphasise this reluctance to open the South Coast to economic benefits, the state government continues to avoid confronting the need to upgrade the Princes Highway, despite the appalling record of road deaths over recent months.</para><para>My colleague in the state seat of South Coast, Shelley Hancock, is also conscious of the surge in demand and has called on the state government to accelerate the investigation of a third bridge crossing over the Shoalhaven River. The present crossing represents a traffic bottleneck where, if a major incident blocked the existing crossing, road traffic would have to be diverted through Goulburn. In this day and age, people have greater expectations of service and, clearly, the existing infrastructure is well overdue for a makeover.</para><para>As enthusiastic as I might be about opening road links, I know and appreciate how important it is to find the right balance. I also appreciate that it is not wise to assume that everything will remain constant and that there exists a need to hedge for the future. That is why I have been enthusiastically pursuing new innovations that will contribute towards a more diverse economic and social culture. Health is becoming more focused in importance each day as our population grows in Gilmore. More and more the community is doing the work of the state government.</para><para>A linear accelerator is required for our increasing number of patients having to travel to Wollongong for treatment—and I use the word `travel' loosely, for you can forget about the trains; you need a car. Until you have been caught in such a situation, it is difficult to imagine the plight of my constituents who rely on this external health service. That is why I will fight tooth and nail to see an MRI licence being granted for the Shoalhaven. Once again, our people have to go to Wollongong for this, as that is the only service licensed in the Illawarra. Shoalhaven has one but it is not licensed and therefore not claimable through Medicare. I am in constant contact with the minister on this matter and anxiously await his decision. Yet again the public have rallied for an oncology unit for the Milton-Ulladulla area hospital and are still waiting for support from the state government, as they are waiting for a linear accelerator.</para><para>In 1996, when the government came into power, Gilmore's aged care services were well below the quota. All licences went to the Illawarra, Wollongong and Shellharbour with Kiama and the Shoalhaven not on the radar. I am pleased to be able to report that since then 1,600 extra beds and aged care packages have been delivered. That is not to say we do not need more—we certainly do. We are hopeful of further announcements to be made. Each of our aged care facilities are first class with excellent staff who really care for our elderly.</para><para>With respect to youth, where do I start? There are always the positive aspects which rarely get mentioned, such as our Defence cadets, our citizen cadets, our recent young people's first aid training course, our talented musicians, our young playwrights and artists—and the list goes on and on. But, as ever, the media concentrates on the negatives, and we have not missed out. There is no doubt that all governments, parents and schools have a responsibility towards lowering our road carnage. This government has announced it will be supporting the notion that young drivers should be taught skills to enable them to survive the carnage of our roadways, and the Princes Highway is certainly a separate issue to be addressed. </para><para>Many of the drivers involved are in the high-risk bracket. They are predominantly male in the 17 to 25 year age group and we have a large percentage of young people in Gilmore. They are not always the victims, but this demographic looms large in many vehicle accidents. Even before the concept of compulsory driver training for that age group was raised, we had started the process to have such a facility in our electorate, both in Nowra and Ulladulla. Yet the New South Wales government withdrew funding recently for one such program, which is hardly surprising given their record. I am on the record as stating that schools have a role to play in the education of would-be drivers, starting by educating them at primary school, certainly with the rules of the road, a sense of respect for others, awareness and respect for the law and setting the right examples in behaviour.</para><para>Whilst still on the subject of young people, I raise the opposite, so to speak, and that is the role of grandparents. In recent years, I have been dismayed at the increase in grandparents taking responsibility for their children's children through sheer necessity, social problems, family break-ups or health or medical reasons. These are wonderful, caring people and they seem to have been forgotten by governments in the past. It is heartbreaking to see grandparents in their 60s and 70s having to take on the responsibility for young children and sometimes three or four in their own family. But they do it without complaint. I would like to thank our former minister, Larry Anthony, for recognising this and creating legislation that will assist these people to lead a financially improved life. I fully acknowledge that a lot more needs to be done and I will work actively towards those changes.</para><para>Without a doubt, family law, child support and child custody is the hardest area to solve in my electorate. It is heart-rending to see parents destroy each other by using their children for their own agendas. There has to be a fairer way of dealing with these issues. Allied to that, this year I have given a further commitment to try and work towards improving the delivery of mental health and depression services. As one who travels extensively throughout the electorate, I cannot but see the areas of concern.</para><para>It is far easier for me to concentrate and actively work towards infrastructure and roads, but it is also incumbent upon me to act and to understand the needs of those with that insidious disease that comes to us through no fault of our own and is so common in today's society. It never ceases to amaze me just how many people are affected by it and how people work to overcome it or, worse still, try to hide it and still lead some semblance of normal life. It is true that there are not enough professional people to deal with this growing problem. The state government does little to recognise it, and if you try to find an establishment where you can get such help there is a waiting list of weeks and months. It is a sad indictment that desperate families have begged to have their child put in jail because they feel that there they would at least get proper treatment. This is not something I am prepared live with. I will actively pursue all levels of government in lifting their role to assist. Another group we will be working for, together with pollies from both sides of the political fence, is our Parkinson's support group, by trying with determination to have them acknowledged on a federal level.</para><para>Tourism and small business are significant contributors to commerce in Gilmore, and it is no secret why so many visitors flock to Gilmore to enjoy our lifestyle. From mountains to the sea, we have it all—from luxury accommodation to a tent by the beach; from large shopping centres to the village general store. My background has been in tourism and hospitality for many years and, as such, I could wax lyrical about the exciting and challenging opportunities on offer to us. Yet we have not succeeded in putting together a project to gain advantage from the many federal tourism grants available. I intend to address that by working energetically towards formulating a suitable approach, together with the tourism officers from Wingecarribee Shire, Shoalhaven and Kiama, with particular emphasis on the off-peak seasons. </para><para>Finally, the completion of our fast-growing university campus at Moss Vale is in sight. It was this government that again recognised the needs of the Shoalhaven and Southern Highlands ever-growing young population and of the need to provide a decent place for tertiary education. With this continued growth has come the need to broaden our horizons and harness the ever-growing cultural, musical and artistic talents on offer. Minister Kemp is well aware of our special icon Bundanon, having visited Gilmore on numerous occasions. Time is now well overdue for a performing, multi-use cultural centre both in the Shoalhaven and Kiama. In a city of about 95,000 such a centre is of necessity to promote our wealth of talent. Council needs assistance to build the facility. The Shoalhaven has an annual growth rate of over two per cent, but council's rate is being stymied through the fact that 65 per cent of the Shoalhaven is either Crown land or National Parks and Wildlife Service reserve. The community has prepared a strong case to support an arts centre, but it needs funding to get the ball rolling. My role will be to help the community find the means to get the project up, an item high on my agenda for this term.</para><para>Last but not least I turn to the environment. There is no doubt that Gilmore is an icon in regard to its natural beauty, in beach, estuaries, lakes and rivers, mountains and dams. The Shoalhaven and Wingecarribee supply much of their water to Sydney—a very sensitive topic, I might add. The first, a very large effluent scheme, was instituted by Shoalhaven City Council, whereby the historical effluent discharge to the ocean was minimised by piping effluent outfall to 16 large farming properties. It is proving a real blessing during drought. Kiama municipality in Gilmore is looking at options to provide the same. I intend to assist with identifying possible sources of environmental funding for this and many other necessary environmental projects. Green Corp has been highly successful, both from the point of view of ridding our land of bitou bush, repairing sand dunes and bush regeneration. It has also been very successful in assisting some 3,000 young people in our electorate to learn skills, both in environmental studies and work ethics. Almost half of these young people have gone on to gain full-time employment.</para><para>This right of reply has allowed me to document our forward plan for Gilmore, one that I will vigorously pursue. I would like to publicly thank the three local government councils in Gilmore for their cooperative support, those being the Shoalhaven City Council, Wingecarribee Shire Council and Kiama Municipal Council. It is an honour and a pleasure to work with them in getting the job done in Gilmore.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>214</page.no><name role="metadata">Sawford, Rod, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SAWFORD</name><name.id>3J4</name.id><electorate>Port Adelaide</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last year, I had the pleasure of being involved in two elections, one in Australia and one in the United States. Despite all the commentary to the contrary throughout the year and indeed during both elections, neither were going to be line-ball elections. In the respective prevailing economic conditions in both countries there was simply no way Labor, the Democrats or John Kerry could win. However, it was absolutely fascinating to observe both academic and political commentary in both countries at first-hand. Most was and proved to be totally inaccurate and often inane. </para></talk.start><para>Political commentary in both countries has deteriorated yet again into a weak, pale laxative of largely synthesised nonsense bereft of proper analysis. Too many political academics and journalists appear to act out of a fear that they seem shaken by a recognition that they may have wasted their careers by not engaging in and observing the lives of people around them. That applies to some politicians too, but fewer than most people would think. More importantly, these people in the media and in academia seem to become wholly and totally intimidated at the prospect of an economic, cultural and communications revolution commencing and leaving them behind as irrelevant.</para><para>Since the end of World War II, there have been only five changes of government in 60 years. The 1949 election, which saw the re-emergence of Robert Menzies, was largely reported as an election won on petrol pricing and nationalisation of the banks. It was not. Both were factors, of course, but very minor factors. Labor lost because the economy was out of control, with interest rates rising, inflation rising and unemployment rising. The next change happened in 1972, the election which saw Gough Whitlam elected as Prime Minister of Australia. This was largely reported as a strategic masterpiece of campaigning with the `It's time' campaign. Wrong. In fact, the result was an underachievement. Labor won by only eight seats; it should have won by 16 to 25. There was a vast gap between the campaign and what actually happened on the ground. But again the economy was out of control with rising interest rates, rising inflation and rising unemployment.</para><para>The next change was in 1975. This election was largely reported as the Gough Whitlam dismissal election. Wrong. The economy was out of control with rising inflation, rising interest rates and rising unemployment. The next election in 1983 was largely reported as the Hawke rising star ascendancy. Wrong again. The economy was out of control, with rising interest rates, rising inflation and rising unemployment. Members opposite will remember they were all above 10 per cent—the trifecta of doom for any government. In 1996, the next change, the election was largely reported as the Keating downfall. Wrong again. The economy was out of control with rising interest rates—they went from 10 per cent to 10½ per cent. Inflation went from 1.2 per cent to 3.7 per cent, and even though the employment measurement mechanism changed everybody knew that unemployment was higher, although the figure was supposedly lower.</para><para>There are only three other elections of note. The 1961 election was fascinating. Interest rates went up, inflation went down and unemployment remained the same. Menzies, the incumbent, won by the narrowest margin—one seat. I remember it well. My father lost a week's wages to his father because, even though they both supported Labor, my grandfather was sure that Menzies would hang on by the barest margin, and he did. He has been correct every since. In 1990, interest rates rose from 15½ per cent to 17 per cent. Inflation, however, fell from 9.4 per cent to 8.6 per cent and unemployment fell from 7.8 per cent to 6.1 per cent. The incumbent, Hawke, won. It was never in doubt.</para><para>In 1993 we had the unlosable election—so called by so many commentators. What a nonsense! In 1993 unemployment was 10.9 per cent, but interest rates fell from 17 per cent to 10 per cent and inflation fell from 8.6 per cent to 1.2 per cent. Keating was never in any danger whatsoever. Hewson had no hope whatsoever. And 49 of the 51 members of the political press gallery got it spectacularly wrong. Only two got it right: Amanda Buckley and Laura Tingle. They are slow learners that lot, bereft of analytic skills, but we will keep it quiet; they get angry when you remind them. As United States Democratic Party Speaker Sam Rayburn said after Franklin D. Roosevelt's landslide 1936 win: </para><quote><para>When you get too big a majority, you're immediately in trouble.</para></quote><para>From 1975 onwards, Malcolm Fraser had effective control of the Senate; he blew it. Howard will have control from 1 July this year. There are but two basic options: control the economy, stop throwing money at undeserving groups and use the revenue to build the nation's skills, infrastructure and competitiveness; or blow the economy, as Howard did under Malcolm Fraser. If Howard controls the economy, there needs to be a balance between the public and private good. That prospect looks pretty poor, given the massive increase in subsidies to private health and private education in recent years and the continuing ratcheting up of subsidies. If Howard controls the economy, his government will need to invest in infrastructure to improve efficiencies in the economy and deliberately acquit high-skill, high-pay job dividends for the expenditure.</para><para>With the exception of the Alice Springs-Darwin railway—which, by the way, the government got right despite all the barking criticism of many in the eastern states—and, obviously, increased defence expenditure, there appears little evidence that Howard will increase infrastructure expenditure, AusLink included. If Howard controls the economy, he will need to balance his responses to the capital markets and not be intimidated by them, as so many of our state governments appear to be. If Howard is to control the economy, he will need to deliberately upgrade education and training to give the Australia of the future a highly skilled and competitive labour force. He won't. He never has and he never will. In the longer term, this inattention to building the nation's infrastructure and building the nation's skills base will lead to higher inflation and higher interest rates, and it will lead inevitably to the loss of government.</para><para>Immediately after the election, Senator Nick Minchin raised the issue of voluntary voting. The sycophants of the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, raised the issue of abortion. Both issues were raised in the context that they would divide the Australian community. Senator Minchin wants to diminish community participation in elections; that is clear to everyone. His methodology is divisive and he knows it. So too the abortion debate. If government members seriously wanted to do something positive, the topic would not be abortion; it would have been the prevention of unwanted pregnancies, as the member for Moore apparently stated in the coalition party room yesterday. This topic includes all good people of goodwill. The topic of abortion drags every lunatic in Australia into one room. Last year, to his credit, the Prime Minister dropped both of these issues—or so we thought. Abortion, in all its demented divisiveness, is now back, and the Prime Minister thinks it is deserving of debate.</para><para>What about voluntary voting? What about all those other divisive issues taking attention away from the main game: keeping the economy under control? Your guess is as good as mine, but just remember Democratic Party Speaker Sam Rayburn's words in 1936:</para><quote><para>When you get too big a majority, you're immediately in trouble.</para></quote><para>The elections in the United States and Australia, so similar in so many ways, lead us to ask some pertinent questions. What sort of country is Australia becoming? Is Australia becoming a country with a line between church and state that is inviolate? Is Australia becoming a country where religion trumps science? Is Australia becoming a country where leaders mobilise deep moral energies to divide us from each other and the world? Is Australia becoming a country that interferes with the rights of women to control their bodies? Is Australia becoming a country that intrudes into people's sexual preferences? Is Australia becoming a country where religious energy is used in politics to promote division and intolerance, and is that energy really on God's agenda? These are important questions. </para><para>I have always had the view, one that I note is shared by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, that your religious viewpoint ought to be private. In fact, one of the great strengths of the Australian democracy is that that belief is a basic tenet of our nation. People seem to forget that the overwhelming majority of religions in the world are not democratic—never have been and never will be. Nor are countries democratic when religions control the nation. Those points have no impact whatsoever on the right of all Australians to believe in and practice whatever faith they choose, but people do not have the right to interfere in the political process and to push their own particular morality on the rest of the population.</para><para>Good governments should insulate the Australian community from the economic shocks of interest rates, inflation and unemployment. Good governments should build on the skills base of the nation and invest in the necessary infrastructure to ensure our competitiveness into the future. And good governments should protect and insulate the Australian community from the loopy minorities that raise their heads from time to time. The current alliance with the fundamentalist religious Right is a case in point. It will, as it always does, end in tears, unnecessary anger and division and an overinflated sense of importance, taking the community backwards and wasting precious human energies.</para><para>The government is showing signs of losing control of the economy. Inflation is creeping up already. It always does when you fail to invest in infrastructure and a proper skills base. The same applies to rising interest rates. The current account deficit is fast approaching seven per cent, not the six per cent that has been quoted in the papers over the last couple of years. Personal debt in Australia is skyrocketing. The stock market is overvalued, as is the housing market. The economy as it is currently structured in Australia is simply not sustainable, and a judgment day and a shift correction is fast approaching. It has always been thus and it will prove to be the case yet again, catching out the greedy and those in debt—the rich and the poor—just as did past corrections in the 1890s, the thirties, the sixties, the eighties and so on. Corrections do not discriminate in favour of the forces of good or of evil in our community, more is the pity. The most vulnerable are always the worst affected. In the next few years those who have eliminated debt will be the only people in this country who will have the chance to ride out the massive correction when it arrives.</para><para>The Prime Minister is fast heading in the same direction he did when he was Treasurer to Malcolm Fraser. Control of the Senate did not help Malcolm Fraser; he wasted every opportunity that was presented to him. It may, similarly, not help John Winston Howard. In the next few years under the Howard government, Australians can look forward to rising interest rates on massive mortgages. A rise in the rate of just one per cent on mortgages of sometimes $200,000, $300,000 or $400,000 is a huge impost on families each month. Under the Howard government Australians can look forward to rising inflation—already happening—and lower wages. There is government activity already pushing in that area, too. </para><para>Under the Howard government Australians can look forward to rising unemployment and underemployment. In fact, it is this issue of underemployment that will become the real problem, more so than it is today. All of us are confronted on a daily basis by the number of people who come into our offices wanting to work 30 or more hours a week but who only have 10 or 15 hours a week or a fortnight and cannot get any more. In the meantime, when corrective economic action could have been taken, we will have a divided Australia talking up the merits or demerits of abortion, voluntary voting, the religious Right, private education and private health—in fact, any topic whatsoever that divides the Australian populous and takes us further from addressing the real problems and the challenges facing this country.</para><para>The world is changing dramatically. Hundreds of millions of people—at least 300 million in countries like China, India and Indonesia—in the next five years will assume higher skills and financial status. They will demand, as is their right, more manufactured goods, infrastructure expenditure and accommodation needs, and this is going to put enormous pressure on the price of fuel and resources—oil in particular. The American economy—the biggest economy in the world, 25 per cent of the world's economy—saved so often in the past by the spending patterns of US consumers, is I believe much more fragile than most people appreciate or realise. A withdrawal of investment from the US economy by the remainder of the world would have disastrous consequences, and for Australia too. The salient point to make is what I have described as probable and likely, not the opposite.</para><para>When individuals, groups or governments put their heads in the sand and play side games, as we are seeing at the moment, they usually get their rears kicked and their heads crunched. Dealing with side issues while ignoring the main game seems to be an increasing activity of the Howard government and its frontbench and backbench. Mind you, it has company in the world, with other countries doing exactly the same in their attempt to direct attention from the real problems of the nation. Mr Mahathir in Malaysia was, of course, an expert at this, and he often directed his anger at Australia when in fact he had problems in his own country. But I love this little example in North Korea. Do you know that in North Korea they are currently conducting a campaign against long hair? Probably facial hair too.

In South Australia I am very fortunate in that I have perhaps the most active branch. Unlike a lot of FECs, we meet every month. We have a good time, and we have a good group of people. In our FEC, unlike some, you can say whatever you like. You can disagree with the federal member; you can disagree with anybody. You can actually participate, and you are encouraged to participate. That loyalty that those members give me is a great honour and a great privilege.

The sad part that we often do not acknowledge is that, in the meantime, millions of people have been very badly hurt in the process. When governments lose, as they always do, many people are harmed—not just the politicians. It is usually the community that is harmed very badly. The new government always has the very difficult challenge of getting things back on a level again. To those people in Port Adelaide, there are some issues coming up that I hope to speak on from time to time, including the AusLink proposals. Hopefully those issues will become important, and I will be able to expound on those at a later date.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>219</page.no><name role="metadata">Vale, Danna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs VALE</name><name.id>VK6</name.id><electorate>Hughes</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As the member for Hughes, it is a privilege and an honour to be able to add my name to that of my colleagues and members of this House in responding to the address of His Excellency the Governor-General at the opening of the 41st Parliament of Australia. His Excellency clearly articulated for us the steady progress of the government's economic reforms, the increased resilience of our national economy and our enviable position in the world as one of the stronger performing nations. His Excellency also profiled several of the many issues that will challenge the 41st Parliament. I would like to speak to some of those challenges and add a few thoughts of my own. I want to speak about the nature of the current conflict in which we find ourselves, which we call the war against terrorism, of the continuing violence against Aboriginal women and children, and of the contradiction in public policy terms between an ageing population and the depopulation of unborn children in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The war against terrorism is the name for the current conflict which engages the focus of our national security. For today's Australians, it is the challenge of our generation. It is fair to say that the vast majority of Australians reject ideas, political movements, events or incidents which appear to deny the most basic human rights to our fellow Australians, most especially when such ideas, political movements, events or incidents are also seen as totalitarian in nature. Totalitarianism can be explained as a regime in which the state or government controls nearly every aspect of the individual's life. According to Wikipedia, totalitarian governments do not tolerate activities by individuals or groups that are not directed at the regime's goals. Such regimes maintain themselves in power through any or all of the following: secret police, propaganda disseminated through the media, active exclusion of any open criticism of the regime and the use of violence and terror tactics. Internal and external threats are created to foster unity of the population through fear.</para><para>The term has been used to describe nationalist, imperialist, fascist or communist regimes. However, a common element is that such a regime is in direct conflict with the `free world' as we understand it. Such governments, regimes or movements that can be labelled totalitarian are marked by extreme brutality to its opponents. The ruling ideology demands that every aspect of an individual's life is subordinate to that of the regime; and this includes education, occupation, income, recreation and religion, even including family life and relationships. </para><para>Further, it is not a Left or Right issue. Stalin from the Left and Hitler from the Right were bitter enemies, but both ran totalitarian-like regimes. Their place on the political spectrum mattered not one whit to their citizenry, who existed in a state of terror and fear. Nor, it seems, is such a regime an aberration of Western civilisation. For example, Stalin, Mussolini, Hitler and Franco were later joined by Mao Zedong, Idi Amin, Pol Pot and Saddam Hussein, to name a few from Eastern traditions. Like today's Islamic radicals, and their soul brothers the Islamic terrorists, they all believed in the total state, the total doctrine and the total adherence of their populations to the movement.</para><para>These are some of the points that Paul Berman makes in his book published last year entitled <inline font-style="italic">Terror and Liberalism</inline>. He suggests that the philosophical foundations of today's Islamic suicide bomber have been drawn from the same pathological Western ideas that led to Stalin and Hitler. Berman points out that the only way in which Islamic terrorists differ from the totalitarianism of Western civilization is that the Islamic terrorists have been passed through an Islamic prism—a radical militant Islamic prism—and consequently the current war of terror against the West and its values is being waged through an extreme, religious Islamic world view.</para><para>The irony is that the philosophical roots of today's Islamic terrorist can be traced back to the anarchy of Lenin's totalitarianism that had developed into indiscriminate violence and mass terror. The terrorists imported these feral Western views, acquired in Western Europe, back to the Middle East and incorporated them into a new form of militant Islam that Berman terms Islamism. The policy implication in all this is that as a community we need to understand the nature of what we are fighting against when we speak of the war against terrorism. Our Australian Muslim and non-Muslim communities need to see that we are not simply fighting terrorism as some kind of opaque, confusing political movement.</para><para>The former US Secretary of the Navy and current member of the Kean Commission investigating the September 11 bombings, John Lehman, in his address to the US Naval Institute on 31 March 2003, said:</para><quote><para>We are currently in a war, but it is not a war on terrorism. In fact, that has been a great confusion, and the sooner we drop that term, the better. This would be like President Franklin Roosevelt saying in World War II “we are engaged in a war against kamikazes and blitzkrieg”. Like them, terrorism is a method, a tool, a weapon that has been used against us.</para></quote><para>He goes on to speak of `the emergence of a trans-national enemy driven by religious fervour and fanaticism' for which the US government was simply not prepared. He says:</para><quote><para>Our enemy is not terrorism. Our enemy is violent, Islamic fundamentalism. None of our government institutions was set up with receptors, or even vocabulary, to deal with this. So we left ourselves completely vulnerable to a concerted attack.</para></quote><para>Because Australia is a liberal democracy, with a considerable emphasis on individual freedoms and personal liberty, we will always be an anathema to such a religious fundamentalist movement that is totalitarian in nature. We are a living example of what it considers to be so terribly wrong. Only when we understand the totalitarian character of this radical religious phenomenon can we take appropriate steps to counter and repel its intolerance and aggression. We have to call it what it is; we have to understand its nature to allow us to develop an appropriate defence. </para><para>To secure our future in this increasingly uncertain world, we must no longer be tolerant of the intolerant. Clearly articulating the nature of the challenge encourages policies to implement appropriate government strategies and, far more importantly, to garner wider community understanding and support. As Australians, both Muslim and non-Muslim, we are against all those who would seek to derail, especially violently derail, our democratic institutions, our Australian values of a fair go for all, our religious and political freedoms and our tolerant, easy-going way of life.</para><para>In some ways, many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women live in fear of abuse in a kind of de facto totalitarian state that is marked by violence and isolation in remote communities in the very heartland of this democratic nation of ours. In June 2000, I spoke in this House about a war zone in Australia today. I was speaking in response to the report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women's Taskforce on Violence, chaired by Professor Bonnie Robertson from Queensland.</para><para>In the light of that report, I said that in some Indigenous communities violence and sexual abuse against women and children had reached a crisis point. While the source of this violence could be traced to the impact of history, with the consequences of dispossession, marginalisation, unemployment, alcoholism and poor education, it mattered little to the innocent women and children who were being bashed, raped, mutilated and murdered on an appallingly large scale. The Robertson report showed that many women, children and the elderly led a life that was a continuum of frequent mayhem and violence and that the women and children in particular were being deliberately ignored by those who had a duty to protect them.</para><para>In his address to this parliament, the Governor-General referred to the need to address family violence in Indigenous communities. I know that the government has made a determined effort to remedy the appalling state of affairs to which Professor Robertson drew attention. For example, the Family Violence Prevention Legal Services program will come on stream from March this year, with a total of 26 units operating Australiawide within the next four years. A further $22.7 million over four years has been committed by our government, and the units will be located predominately in rural and remote areas of high need.</para><para>However, despite this and other measures that have been implemented, it appears that the situation of women in rural and remote Indigenous communities has even worsened since the year 2000. According to Professor Robertson, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian </inline>newspaper in January this year, the problem is increasing. Professor Robertson says that we need to be addressing the causes rather than the consequences of family violence and identifies a growing sense of frustration all around. Others suggest that we should immediately address the consequences. Ideally, it should be both. But, when we come to a serious accident, first aid should be applied while we wait for the ambulance. So too with this problem. We should be tackling the immediate consequences while calling for the resources to deal with the causes.</para><para>I would like to see federal and state governments, the law enforcement agencies and particularly the courts emulate the British government's actions of enforcing the law against the sexual abuse of women and children on Pitcairn Island. The Pitcairn Island abuse occurred some years ago. If only Australian women in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities could get the justice that the women of Pitcairn have at last received. The key to doing this is the protection of women and children from reprisals if they do come forward to seek the justice that is due to them. </para><para>As a first step in providing such protection, there is a great need to provide more safe houses in isolated and remote communities, where women and children can find sanctuary from imminent danger. There also needs to be in place a dedicated transport arrangement to enable them to escape the immediate danger in their community and find longer term safety elsewhere. If non-Indigenous women have a need for and ready access to these facilities, then so too should Indigenous women in remote communities. Indigenous women have to have good cause to feel safe enough to come forward and to seek help and support. If this does not happen—and if the last five years are anything to go by—then in another five years time we will still be pouring tens of millions of dollars into a problem that remains a national shame.</para><para>One of the longstanding problems of Indigenous affairs is that the majority of rural, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women have been marginalised—not only in the governing of their own communities but also in exercising influence over the policies of successive governments. I believe there has been a watershed change to this problem, with the government's decision last year to close ATSIC and all that it represented; with the establishment of the National Indigenous Council, headed by magistrate Sue Gordon; and with the appointment of members to the NIC who, so far, appear to have a positive inclination to seeking solutions. It is long overdue and a welcome step in the right direction—towards destroying a total denial of their basic human right to live without fear and violence. This is a kind of cultural totalitarian way of life, if you like, wrought by circumstances of social breakdown, cultural dilution and marginalisation that is marked by rural isolation: a lack of individual rights and a powerlessness that has fed on our past indifference.</para><para>Australia is a wealthy country, a land of great opportunity and—for most of us—a land of great personal freedoms and expression. It is time that these Australian women shared in our freedom and prosperity. We must empower them by seeking their direction on their needs and ensuring that their requests are delivered. I look forward to the full implementation of the new legislation and to some positive outcomes from the new council that will impact in a meaningful way on the tragic lives of these Australian women and children.</para><para>I now refer to recent interest in and call for a debate on abortion, raised by those who are uncomfortable with the high number of abortions and the reports of women suffering from post abortion trauma, and who have recognised that some scientific and technological developments over the last decade are raising legitimate questions about abortion that previously did not exist.</para><para>The issue of the high number of abortions each year—whatever that high number is—is also relevant to our future population profile, which in turn has implications for our future prosperity. Australia has a birth rate of 1.7 per woman, which is below the population replacement level of 2.1 births per woman. Australia's welfare system was developed when the proportion of our over 65 years of age population was much lower than it is today. This is of serious concern to those who would ensure our economic sustainability and our future prosperity.</para><para>To this end, long-term government policy has spent millions of dollars on our immigration program and more recent policy has aimed at providing a $3,000 contribution to assist new mothers with their babies. Excluding medical terminations, if most of the 70,000 or more abortions of choice in Australia each year were not performed, this would have a significant and beneficial impact on the demographic and economic outlook for Australia. On the one hand there is hand wringing about our critically low birth rate while on the other hand there is the government subsidy of abortion of choice. This represents a conflict in public policy, to say the least. </para><para>Abortion is not an academic issue for me. As a young mother with three children under three, I was presented with serious medical reasons for not continuing with a fourth, unexpected pregnancy. I know the darkness of that deep emotional abyss. I exercised my free-will choice, but I continued with the pregnancy. I support the free-will choice of all women to make their own decision between an abortion and a baby. It is not for men or governments to take that free-will choice away.</para><para>Australia is a free, liberal democracy. We have a birthright to make our own decisions on such personal matters because we each have to live with the consequences of those decisions. But—with the exception of medical terminations, and stepping aside from the deep emotional aspects of this subject—we can clinically observe in abortions of choice, at the very least, a lifestyle choice and, at the very worst, the most brutal form of contraception.</para><para>When one appreciates that contraceptives are readily accessible and relatively inexpensive today—and if the figures of between 70,000 and 95,000 abortions annually in Australia are anywhere near correct—and allows for a percentage of preventative measures that may fail, that still leaves a lot of women and men who are not taking responsibility for their sexual activity. So one could well ask: why should the Australian taxpayer? In this scenario, such abortions of choice are a service of choice and should, appropriately, be self-funded by the user.</para><para>From my inquiries it appears that abortion clinics charge around $500 for an abortion. The mother contributes around $180 and presents her Medicare card. The balance of $27.2 million—that figure, of course, is annualised—is paid for by the Australian taxpayer. However, any reform of Medicare funding for an abortion should at least require that independent, factual information and alternatives are provided to the woman when taxpayer dollars are spent. In this way the taxpayer can be assured that such funding is truly being spent on a woman's health needs and on giving her an informed choice of all her options.</para><para>I make this point because I have a group of women in my electorate who are in a desperate situation, not of their choice or making, and they are struggling. They are struggling to bring up special needs children or support special needs young adults, and the resources from governments have been drying up progressively over many years. Many of these women are struggling alone because the fathers could not cope and walked away and left them with the job. Many do not get sufficient respite. Many have surrendered career opportunities. Many are lonely. Many live below the poverty line. Such is the life of a carer today. All of these women are acutely aware of a great unmet need for services, for education, for occupational training, for accommodation, for respite, for educational services for their family members—and I could go on. When they gather the strength to approach governments they are always told there is no funding available for them. Yet we do have funding for those who freely choose to avail themselves of an abortion when many of them could also freely choose to take other preventative measures. </para><para>As I said before, I leave the choice about an abortion to the free will of the pregnant woman. But her free-will choice should be an informed free-will choice and should be based upon up-to-date information. She should also have the widest possible range of alternatives for her consideration when she makes that choice. Medical science knows so much more today about the development of the foetus than it did 10 years ago. A foetus can no longer be dismissed as a disposable piece of human tissue. Modern technology is increasingly informing the layperson that the human foetus has its own genetic identity and its own cerebral activity. It has an independent heartbeat, an independent circulatory system. A human foetus can grab and hold on to the finger of an operating surgeon. Another development is that medical science is helping premature babies to survive at an earlier stage.</para><para>I do support the efforts of Senators Boswell and Santoro to seek comprehensive data and up-to-date information on the number of abortions and on any negative psychological or other detrimental health outcomes that have been experienced by women after an abortion, so that governments can offer appropriate support services. It is of some concern to learn of an increase in post-abortion depression amongst women who have been traumatised by the experience of an abortion. Anecdotal evidence from consulting psychologists indicates that some women are not getting the appropriate counselling before they undergo such an operation. It is clear that greater and credible research to this special area of woman's health is imperative. Such research and data is not only necessary to inform governments in the provision of appropriate support services but also to inform and empower a woman in making her own choice.</para><para>The issues I have raised today are very current issues which are of concern to most Australians. They touch on our national security, our responsibility to our Indigenous sisters and their children, the quirkiness of our population policy and the special plight of those exceptional Australians who care for family members with special needs. As the Governor-General said:</para><quote><para>... Australia stands on the threshold of a new era of national achievement. With renewed energy and purpose, the government rededicates itself to the great ideals of the Australian nation and to the service of the Australian people.</para></quote><para>His Excellency concluded his address by saying that our nation is a leading example of democratic freedom, institutional stability and economic wellbeing. For those of us here, it is our job to keep it that way and to use our best endeavours to ensure that such values are shared equally with all the people of Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>224</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Firstly, I want to welcome you, Mr Deputy Speaker McMullan, on your accession to the Speaker's panel.

However, that was not to be. That is past history, but the future may hold other things for both of us. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Today I will speak in a somewhat unusual way. Normally I speak off-the-cuff but today, in my speech in the address-in-reply debate, I am going to refer to notes. I hope to mount an argument which will give the lie not only to what the Prime Minister has been putting about in question time—in particular, yesterday's question time—but also to what he has been putting about after the election, in the address-in-reply debate and in the election campaign. The fundamental context of my speech is the fact that the government won the election. It did so, in good part, because of the arguments it put in regard to interest rates. The government felt it had a convincing case—and certainly many people in the community thought so—compared to Labor's.</para><para>Even since being elected to the Speaker's panel, I have often interjected in question time during the Prime Minister's arguments that this coalition government's performance—and the performance of all coalition governments—in relation to the economic indicators for inflation, unemployment and interest rates has always been better than Labor's. I am here to give the lie to that today. As you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker McMullan, from your past experience in the Hawke-Keating government, that is simply not true; it is incorrect to argue that. The Prime Minister does it, though, day after day. Of course, he has form on a number of matters, but he also has the signal distinction of being the only Treasurer in the more than 100-year history of the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia who has achieved the trifecta of double-digit unemployment, a double-digit interest rate and a double-digit inflation rate. Noone else has had those three indicators go so badly. Other people have had recessions. There was the 198283 recession, responsibility for which we lay at the very door of the then Treasurer, John Howard, the member for Bennelong. He is the person who was responsible for running Australia's economy at that time.</para><para>Everyone here should remember and have imprinted on their memory the depth and extent of that recession and the amount of time we took to dig ourselves out of that during the Hawke-Keating period. But they should also have imprinted on their memory the three figures pegged up on boards around Australia in January 1983. Unemployment was at 10.1 per cent. Who was the Treasurer? John Howard, the member for Bennelong. Inflation was at 11 per cent. Who was the Treasurer? The member for Bennelong. And then there is the housing loan interest rate—a key issue not only in the last election but also yesterday in question time when the Prime Minister again averred that the coalition has always been better than the Labor Party on interest rates and would always have lower interest rates. He also argued in the propaganda campaign put out during the election campaign that, over a period of 30 years, interest rates have always risen to more than 10 per cent under Labor. In January 1983 the coalition was in power and had been in power since December 1975. Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister and John Howard, the member for Bennelong, was Treasurer; he had taken over from the late Phillip Lynch. The interest rate was 13.5 per cent. Under the coalition, the average for that year was 13.1 per cent.</para><para>The Prime Minister argued only yesterday that Labor had always had higher interest rates. What is the comparator? In the Parliamentary Library, which is at least non-partisan in regard to this, there is a very interesting comparison. Let us remember that interest rates under the Hawke government went to 17 per cent at their highest point. Under the Keating government, they went to 12 per cent at their highest point. John Howard, as Treasurer, achieved 13.5 per cent. But what did they achieve over the life of the government— </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LN6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name></talker><para>—It is a simple comparison. The Whitlam government, parodied by this Prime Minister and hacked to pieces by ministers from this government, averaged a housing interest rate of 9.16 per cent. Over its two terms, the three years it was in power—harried from one end of the Commonwealth to the other by a coalition baying for its blood and doing everything they could to try to stop it from governing—that government achieved an average interest rate of 9.16 per cent.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What was the interest rate under the Fraser government in toto? It was 10.66 per cent. Is it true, as the Prime Minister averred yesterday, that under Labor interest rates are always higher than they are under a coalition government? The answer is no, that is not the case. What was it, though, if you take just John Howard's period as Treasurer? It was a failed, miserable record in so many regards. What was the interest rate? It was 10.94 per cent. That is just under 11 per cent as an average across his total period as Treasurer.</para><para>We will be honest enough to put the comparatives in over the period of the Hawke-Keating government and say that over the life of the government the interest rate was 12.84 per cent. I can readily and strongly argue that there is a conditioning situation and a larger context there. We, coming into government, came in at the end of a period where the economy had been poleaxed by Treasurer John Howard and where the country had been driven into deep recession. In part, this was because of the madness of Prime Minister Fraser, who thought there was going to be a massive resources boom and talked it up through 1980 and 1981. Instead, we had a massive increase in unemployment and fundamental structural problems in the economy that had not been addressed for a number of years and we ended up with an average rate of 12.84 per cent over the life of the government.</para><para>But we were also shackled by something else that is extremely noteworthy. If you look at the current account deficit for the period of January-February it is 4.7 per cent of GDP. That is a significant weight on the government's operations. If you look at John Howard's history, in February 1983 there was 10.7 per cent unemployment, up 0.6 of one per cent; there was 11 per cent inflation; and housing interest rates were at 12½ per cent. That was a trifecta of the very worst economic indicators you could have, with a current account deficit of 4.7 per cent of GDP.</para><para>There was something else that we need to remark on and to underline that conditioned how the Hawke-Keating government, particularly in its early years, dealt with the economy and the problems of trying to restructure it. The member for Fraser well remembers, as do I, that in the week before the 1983 election Treasurer John Howard was asked publicly what the deficit figure would be for the Commonwealth budget at that time. I think it was the Tuesday before the election when he was first asked that. He demurred significantly, but eventually coughed up a figure of $4.6 billion as the deficit in prospect on the advice that he had been given. On the Friday before the election—one single day before the March 1983 election which brought Bob Hawke and the Labor Party to power—Treasurer John Howard, the member for Bennelong, was forced to concede that the $4.6 billion figure he had uttered was not correct. He corrected the record and he said it was closer to $6 billion. Mr Deputy Speaker McMullan, you know and I know that when he uttered the $4.6 billion figure and the $6 billion figure he did not tell the truth, because the reality was that the advice that he got from Treasury was that the deficit looming for the federal budget was $9.6 billion in March 1983 figures. That is a significant amount of weight, you would think, to take on—that budget deficit for one single year. Given all those other economic indicators which were so bad and which no Treasurer before had ever racked up—three double-digit figures—the impact of that deficit on the economy and on the management of the economy was significant. </para><para>What is that $9.6 billion in today's dollars? That $9.6 billion figure has been thrown around in past elections. Something close to that was said just a couple of elections ago by Treasurer Costello. If we actually look at the impact of what that would be in today's dollars, that $9.6 billion would in fact be $35 billion. That would be $35,000 million added to the deficit that the Commonwealth faced in just one simple year. So when the Hawke-Keating government came into power in March 1983 and opened the books, what did they find? What the member for Bennelong said on Tuesday—a $4.6 billion deficit—was false. What he said on Friday—`It was not $4.6 billion; it was closer to $6 billion'—was knowingly false. That $9.6 billion in those dollars is equivalent to $35 billion now.</para><para>Getting up and over that economic hurdle, attempting to restructure an economy that was effectively a basket case, having to deal just three short years later with the cumulative effect and then the one-off effect of a situation where Australia faced a decline in its terms of trade over a 30-year period of one half of a per cent to one per cent per year to, within the period of one month, having a 25 per cent fall in Australia's terms of trade—these were significant and, indeed, unexampled problems facing any treasurer and any government. But manfully and properly, Treasurer Keating, Prime Minister Hawke and the Labor ministry that the member for Fraser was a part of stuck to the job, saw it through and refashioned, under the impetus of what happened in 1986, the economy.</para><para>So dramatically did they refashion Australia's economic infrastructure, substructure and indeed superstructure—to borrow a series of phrases from someone who is buried in Highgate cemetery in London—and so significantly did they change the way in which things are done here that the breaking of the back of inflation in 1990-91, and the low inflationary period that has been in evidence since then, is the key reason why the figures for the affordability of housing or affordability of interest rates for the Howard prime ministership and the Howard government from March 1996 are comparatively good. Certainly they are comparatively good compared to those of Treasurer Howard, a disaster in so many respects and a fundamental failure.</para><para>The member for Bennelong could build on the back of the structural work done by the Hawke-Keating government. He could not build on the back of his own work when he was Treasurer to Prime Minister Fraser. So in this situation we have got a very simple comparison. Even the Whitlam government—so badly spoken of by members of this government—had a better record on housing interest rates than the member for Bennelong did as the Treasurer in the Fraser government. Indeed, if you look at the current Howard government from 1996 until now, there is the Whitlam government standing at 9.16 per cent and what is the average for interest rates under a Howard government operating in a completely changed economic environment building on the back of what had been achieved in our 13 years of government? It is 7.2 per cent—still relatively high and not all that far from the rest. But the key point is it has only been able to be achieved because the back of inflation was broken and a low interest rate regime and a low growth-low inflation rate regime was introduced into Australia, and we simply had not had those conditions for decades, since the early 1950s. So you can do a great deal if you simply ride on the back of that. </para><para>But there is a lot that is not just riding on the back of that. When we are dealing with comparators where you cannot trust what this Prime Minister will say in comparing his government's achievements with what he regards as deficits from former Labor governments—and I think I have just given the lie to what he said in the parliament yesterday and what he argued during the election campaign—if you look at some other indicators you could argue that having a look at interest rates over the life of a parliament is not really the best way to do it because you might not take into account a whole series of factors: when people came to government, what the business cycles were, what the general economic cycles were and what the major movements were worldwide.</para><para>If, however, instead of looking at pure interest rates you looked at home loan affordability as another measure and did a comparison in that regard, you would find something quite different, and that has been done. The Real Estate Institute of Australia and AMP Banking did that and they came up with an average home loan affordability ratio under Hawke and Keating of 39.6. With this figure the higher the number, the better you are doing. You would imagine, given the coalition's argument, that they would have an extremely high number and that they would have well outperformed the Hawke and Keating governments in terms of home loan affordability—particularly with a 7.2 per cent interest rate regime over the life of the government. The reality is that their number is 39.4. They have underperformed the Hawke-Keating governments throughout the whole cycle of the government in terms of home loan affordability.</para><para>When the Prime Minister says, `Interest rates under Hawke went up to 17 per cent,' under the member for Bennelong they went up to 13.5 per cent in January 1983. Take into account that in 1989, when those interest rates were running at 17 per cent, the average home loan was $66,700. Also take into account that just less than one year later the Hawke government was reelected for a fourth time, despite the fact that interest rates were so high, because actual home loan affordability was there. What people did not readily appreciate—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Government members interjecting</inline><inline font-style="italic">—</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LN6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name></talker><para>—I know you do not understand this and that it is really beyond you. You would not have understood the other fundamental point: that whatever the level of interest rates is—13.5 per cent in January 1983 under Treasurer Howard or 17 per cent in 1989—there is also another indicator you take into account and that is the level of inflation at that particular time. You end up doing a subtraction with a real interest rate, and the fundamental is the real interest rate that people are facing. We do that all the time. The Reserve Bank does it when it looks at home and housing affordability here and when it looks also at what the interest rate regime is here and what the settings for that should be and what the comparators are when you look at the key economy to drive this, the United States. We have always been in a position, in having to get money in from overseas, that we have set our interest rates higher than they have been in the United States because of the need to attract people and to have a higher set of interest rates to do so. In 1996, when Labor left office and housing interest rates were at 10½ per cent, the average housing loan was $99,100 and the repayments were $883 a month. In 2004, the average housing loan is $213,600. That is an average repayment of $1,523 at the current housing interest rate of 7.1 per cent. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I said at the start that I would actually read this speech. I have not; I have spoken off-the-cuff again, so I suppose I have broken that promise. But the core point here is that in this speech I have given the lie to the Prime Minister's argument that housing interest rates are always better under the coalition than under Labor. It is actually the reverse, and even the Whitlam government beat him.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>229</page.no><name role="metadata">Elson, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs ELSON</name><name.id>6K6</name.id><electorate>Forde</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This debate is a great opportunity to reflect on the achievements of the Howard government and to discuss our comprehensive agenda for our fourth term. Serving in this place has always been a great honour, but serving as part of the Howard government has been an absolute privilege. I was very fortunate to be part of the first wave, so to speak, having been elected by the people of Forde in 1996. The world and our nation have certainly faced many challenges since then. When I delivered my maiden speech in this place in April 1996 we were a nation suffering the aftershocks of the dreadful Port Arthur massacre. At that time the Prime Minister acted swiftly to introduce national gun control laws to help make our community a safer place.</para></talk.start><para>As the last parliament gathered, the world was still coming to terms with the events of September 11 and the implications for all free nations. Once again the Prime Minister acted decisively to ensure that we have a leading role in the worldwide effort to defend against and defeat terrorism. We have remained steadfast in our resolve to help create a safer, more stable future for Australians and the world. Our resolve was further strengthened by the tragic terrorist bombings in Bali in October 2002, in which so many of our fellow countrymen lost their lives. Our involvement in overthrowing Saddam Hussein has delivered democracy to the people of Iraq, and it continues to be an integral part of the war on terror. Once again our government have never wavered. While others were advocating a withdrawal, we were determined to stay there the full course. The tremendous turnout and the obvious excitement at the recent Iraq elections have vindicated our belief that freedom is worth fighting for.</para><para>Now, tragically, as this parliament is just beginning, our nation and the world are facing yet another challenge—the most devastating natural disaster in our history. The tsunami which devastated entire coastal areas of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and parts of Africa and many, many islands in between has left an indelible mark on the world. The human cost in terms of lives lost is just staggering. The enormous task of rebuilding shattered communities seems almost insurmountable. Again, as the world came together to meet this challenge, Australia has been at the forefront by leading relief efforts and setting new benchmarks with our financial commitment. Once again our government, under the strong leadership of the Prime Minister, have acted decisively in the face of a very difficult challenge.</para><para>It is this sort of leadership that has won the respect and trust of the Australian people. As I did after the 2001 elections, I want to thank the Prime Minister for the great judgment and character he has shown over the past nine years. The Prime Minister has withstood enormous pressure and, at times, ridicule. He has always held strongly to what he believes in, and his desires to do what is in the national interest have always been evident in everything that he says. Anyone knows him behind the scenes, as the people on this side of the House in government do, would see that he is a genuine man who has it in his heart to make sure that he does the right thing by Australia. It is that tenacity and the fact that he remains true to his beliefs that has endeared him to Australians from all walks of life and has even won him begrudging respect from the left-wing media who irrationally dislike him. </para><para>I have been delighted to host many visits from the Prime Minister in my electorate over my time in parliament, and the feedback has always been hugely positive. I can say with certainty that they like him in the electorate of Forde. On behalf of the people of Forde, I thank the Prime Minister for his leadership of our nation, and I certainly look forward to welcoming him back to our local area in the course of this parliament. Today I also take this opportunity to reaffirm my commitment to the people of the Forde electorate. Having lived in our local area for 28 years and having worked closely with our community both before and after entering parliament, I have a deep commitment to our special place in south-east Queensland. My husband, David, and I have raised our eight children in Forde. They are now a very important part of our local community—members of schools, P&amp;Cs and sporting clubs—and our grandchildren are now growing up there and attending local schools. I remain motivated by my desire to seek a better deal for our region, to help local communities and small businesses reach their full potential and to ensure local residents have the best quality of life. That is the bottom line and the reason that I do this job.</para><para>While much has been achieved, there is still a lot more that I have to do. Unfortunately the state government have neglected many services within my region. They have understaffed the Logan Hospital. They have cut services at the Beaudesert Hospital. They have failed to match our funding increases for local state schools. They have failed to put in place truth in sentencing to deal with crime. They have failed to protect our children at risk. They have also failed to do anything about securing our future water supplies in Queensland. In contrast, our government have stepped up to the plate. We have established an after-hours clinic to reduce pressure on our emergency department at the Logan Hospital, which is a public hospital. We have increased funding for local state government schools. We have spent $30.2 million over the past three years in Forde just to improve facilities. We have introduced the Community Crime Prevention Program to give local communities the opportunity to work with police and to help reduce crime, and it is working. We have established the $2.1 billion Australian Water Fund to really tackle water supply and its usage issues.</para><para>The thing is that Labor have always spent a lot of time talking about health, education and the environment, but those words are never backed up by what they do in office at either the state or the federal level. That is the real difference between a government of action and an opposition just of words. We are hands-on and we remain accessible to the Australian people, while Labor squabble amongst themselves. Over the past nine years, many ministers have come to my electorate to talk with our local residents and to listen to their concerns and their ideas. It has been a hallmark of this government that we have never taken our position for granted. We have made a conscious decision to remain in touch and to take a hands-on approach rather than leave the decision making to public servants. We have not forgotten the lessons of Labor's 13 years in office—how out of touch they became with the Australian people and how they lost sight of the hopes and the aspirations of the battlers they had previously claimed to represent.</para><para>In contrast, the Howard government have kept faith with the mainstream Australians that we represent. I believe that the large class of `96 and their members have led the way to this approach. Collectively, we believe in getting out there, being part of the community and listening to and working with our local residents with a real community based approach to politics that Labor has either forgotten or abandoned. I am delighted that our approach has been backed up over the past three years by the class of 2001. Now we have this great class that have just entered. They are brimming with new ideas, enthusiasm and energy, and I am quite sure they are here for the long haul. I take this opportunity to congratulate and welcome our new members and wish each of them well. It certainly augurs well for our government that our members continue to come from a diverse range of real-world backgrounds: police, business, community service and, of course, academia. </para><para>It makes you wonder if Labor are really taking any notice, because it is very telling that once again in Werriwa Labor are looking at endorsing a former trade union official as their candidate. It seems abundantly clear that Labor have not yet learnt the lessons of the 1996 election, let alone 1998, 2001 or 2004. Deep down many Labor members still regard the last three election results as some sort of aberration, crediting the extent of the last loss to being largely due to the personal shortcomings of the former member for Werriwa. At least at the last election they paid lip-service to the need for fundamental change in the ALP and the member for Hotham then tried his best to get some sort of reform happening, but it was very marginal at its best. This time around there have been a few months of navel gazing and infighting, and this now has all been brushed aside amid calls for unity. The new leadership of the member for Brand proves again that he does not have the ticker to make these difficult decisions. Not one single member of Latham's frontbench has been replaced or changed.</para><para>The difference between the government and the Labor opposition is quite stark. The Australian public recognises them. Of course, the biggest difference at the last election was the issue of economic management. The coalition's track record of strong economic growth, low interest rates, low inflation and job growth in the uncertain international climate was well understood and well recognised by the Australian public. In contrast, Labor offered a cobbled together tax policy with figures that did not add up. They described the $600 per child parenting payment as `not real'. They proposed a change to health care that would have blown the budget.</para><para>Further, they had a history in opposition—including during the first, long six years under the current Leader of the Opposition—of opposing every tough decision the government made to bring about the economic conditions we all now enjoy. The Australian people are not silly: they looked at what was on offer and saw a very stark contrast between the government and the Labor opposition—a contrast based not solely on what Labor had done nine years ago while in office but on what they were offering now. Of course, the track record of Labor in government remains very relevant throughout. What makes it especially relevant is that it appears Labor have not learnt from anything at all in the past. I was astounded to hear that the member for Brand, during one of his first interviews as the opposition leader, on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Sunrise</inline> program, declared, `We were very good at running the economy when we were in office.'</para><para>Clearly, either Labor are desperately trying to fool the Australian public by rewriting history or they truly believe it. They have not learnt a thing. And, to be honest, I do not know which is more frightening. Does the member for Brand truly believe that it was good to push interest rates to 17 per cent, to have unemployment up above 10 per cent and to run up more than $96 billion in debt, not to mention small business interest rates of 24 per cent? Who could really stay in business and who could really employ people under those conditions? Does he really think that that was good economic management to have budget after budget where he promised a surplus but ended up delivering a huge deficit? If he truly does, there is a really clear point of difference between us and them because we do not think that high interest rates, high unemployment, successive budget deficits and massive government debt constitute good economic management. </para><para>As one of the many Australians who were struggling to raise a family and who only kept the family home by taking out a huge second mortgage, I can tell the member for Brand that he is not going to get very far trying that line, as we remember what it was really like. Importantly, our kids who were growing up then and who now own their own homes which they are paying off also remember. As I said at the outset, today I reaffirm my very strong personal commitment to the people of Forde. I will continue to take a hands-on approach with my open days and community newsletters. I will be out there speaking with local residents and I will be down here knocking on ministerial doors to make sure that we get what is needed in our electorate.</para><para>I would like to take the time I have left in this speech to briefly thank the many people who helped ensure that I would be returned here today by keeping up their fight. Firstly, I thank the voters of Forde once again for their confidence in me. I was very humbled to get such a phenomenal swing, close to seven per cent, in my fourth term. After a redistribution I was expected to reduce my margin. When I first stood for the seat the margin was notionally 0.1 per cent Liberal and we have built that margin over the four elections to 13.7 per cent. It is a testament to the working relationship I have with my community, and I will continue to work hard to repay that trust. My electorate includes the rural townships of Boonah, Beaudesert, Rathdowney and the beautiful area of Tamborine Mountain and the Kooralbyn district, the growing semirural suburbs of Jimboomber and Logan Village and the suburban areas of Eagleby, Loganlea, Beenleigh and Bethania, fast-growing Gold Coast areas including Coomera, and of course the dozens of small towns and regions in between. Each area has its unique needs and challenges, and I will continue to work with local residents to meet those particular challenges.</para><para>I was extremely heartened by the many offers of help and the support I received throughout my campaign from local residents, some of whom are party supporters and many of  whom are not. To my huge army of volunteers who worked on polling day manning 50 different booths—once again, too many people to mention; over 500 people came out to work on that day—I thank each and every one of you. I am here because of your help and support. A very heartfelt thanks to you and to the campaign committee, especially Chairman John Wallerstein, who has been a rock over many years for my campaign. To my campaign director, Selma: you continue to amaze us. What a talent! You earned the respect of many. Once again, I was fortunate to have a fantastic group of office volunteers who helped my staff in many ways. To Jerry, John, Gwendolyn, Barry and Eve and to the others who have given their time throughout the years, I thank you most sincerely.</para><para>I also want to thank and acknowledge my staff, all of whom do a great job and who worked very long hours for me and continue to do so. Thanks for all the extra effort and thoughtfulness that you displayed during the campaign. I could not ask for better staff. For me to be standing here today is the result of a huge team effort, and I thank every member of my team. Of course, my closest team and greatest cheer squad is my own special family, and I would like to take the time to mention them also. I know it is getting to the point where I will need 20 minutes just to name them all, but I will give it a go. To Selma and Andrew, Kellie and Stuart, Bill and Tracey, Eddie and Sam, George and Kristy, Johllene and Nev, Talena and Heath: without you I would not be standing here today. </para><para>To my 14 beautiful grandchildren, whom I will not name: you make life worth while. My wonderful husband is my love and my never-ending support—he does all the work. Finally, I again express my pride at being part of the government and of this parliament. The challenging times we find ourselves in place a big responsibility on each of us. I know our government will continue to get on with the job of governing in the national interest and delivering a better future to all Australians. Once again, I welcome and congratulate the new members of this House, and I look forward to a productive and positive new parliament.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>233</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to start, in this address-in-reply debate, by thanking the people of Ballarat for putting their faith in me again for a second term. It is a pretty humbling experience to put yourself forward in the context of a federal election, and I really do thank them for their support but also pledge to them that I will not let them down. I will certainly continue to work as hard as I can to improve the circumstances for people in my district. People in my district are not wealthy. For the people in my district, the average household income is around $34,000 a year—I wish it were $34,000 a week; it would be quite extraordinary to have an electorate of that sort of standing. As I said, it is quite a humbling experience to go before them and try and make sure that the policies we have in place are what are needed to make their circumstances better. I certainly think the last election showed that the people of Ballarat are awake to some of the messages that are coming from the Howard government and they have a pretty cynical attitude to some of the things that they are being told by this government.</para></talk.start><para>I particularly also want to thank my campaign team. I do not wish to name all of them individually because there are some other issues I want to talk about here. But I appreciate all of the efforts of the campaign team, my campaign director and my staff, who work incredibly hard and often under pretty tough and demanding circumstances. I also particularly appreciate all of the volunteers—all of those ALP members, supporters and their families and my own family—that do such incredible work getting out to the polling booths, stuffing envelopes and just making sure that life keeps ticking over and that I keep sane. Thank you.</para><para>This government has prided itself on its economic record over its term in government. Like all political parties it has attempted to claim credit for the elements of the economy that are going well and to shift blame for the elements of the economy that are not going so well. That is Marketing 101. But good economic growth does not just happen; it does not just appear out of thin air. You have to build it on a solid foundation and, once that foundation is set, you have to maintain it and manage it. The hidden story of the Howard government's economy is that it did not build the foundations of the good economy we are experiencing; Labor did. Only Labor was able to reach agreement between industry, the states and territories and the union movement to deregulate the Australian economy. We did not always get it right, but we had the courage, the foresight and the determination to build the foundations of the Australian economy that we are benefiting from now.</para><para>The other part of the economic story is that the Howard government has, in the last few years, begun to squander the economic legacy it was left and it has taken its eye off the ball in terms of where Australia's next round of economic growth will come from—and that is a worrying trend. I want to take trade for example. Yesterday the trade minister challenged us to compare Labor's record on trade with the Howard government's record. We did, and it shows that, under Labor, exports grew by an annual rate of 8.1 per cent compared to 3.6 per cent under the Howard government. Under Labor, manufactured exports averaged an annual growth of 11.5 per cent for five years to 1996. Under the Howard government, they have averaged 3.2 per cent for the five years to 2003. Under Labor, services exports averaged an annual growth of 11.7 per cent for the years to 1996. Under the Howard government, services exports averaged a growth of only 4.8 per cent for the five years to 2003. </para><para>Under Labor, Australia's global share of trade peaked at 1.22 per cent in 1989. Under the Howard government, Australia's share of global trade has declined to 0.98 per cent in 2003. Under Labor, net exports consistently made a positive contribution to economic growth. Under the Howard government, net exports have made a negative contribution to economic growth for the past three years. The Howard government, rather than delivering sustained economic growth, has delivered the 38th trade deficit in a row. The government has been coasting along for nine years without a plan to tackle trade and current account deficits.</para><para>In the second of his series of so-called headland speeches in the leadup to the 1996 election, the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, said:</para><quote><para>The $2.9 billion current account deficit figure for May was not only bad news in itself but symbolised the utter failure of current policies to address the problem.</para></quote><para>Today, under the stewardship of John Howard and Peter Costello, the current account deficit has risen to $13.7 billion. Then it was $2.9 billion and the then opposition leader, John Howard, was saying, `bad news in itself but symbolises the utter failure of current policies to address the problem'. Today it is $13.7 billion. In that same headland speech the then Leader of the Opposition said:</para><quote><para>When I left office, net foreign debt stood at a manageable $23 billion. Today our foreign debt burden is crippling $167 billion. That's nearly $10,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia.</para></quote><para>Under the stewardship of this government and the same person who spoke those words in 1996, our foreign debt has risen to $406 billion. So, according to the preferred formula that the Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition, used, it is well over $20,000 for every man, woman and child. Far from being strong on economic policy, the Howard government's performance smacks of laziness and complacency. The reality of the record of the Howard government is that it has produced record foreign debt; record current account deficits; record trade deficits; record household debt; record credit card debt; a record election spending spree, without the savings to fund it; a record low proportion of first home buyers in the market; and a record tax take as the highest taxing government in our history. The economic credentials of this government are yet another of the tales that it likes to tell about itself. The reality of the Howard government's economic laziness is being felt by families. They are paying record taxes, with what is the highest taxing government in our history, but they are receiving less by way of services and are under increasing debt.</para><para>Much of the growth in the economy has been driven by consumer spending and high levels of debt, and frankly it is just not sustainable. Retail figures released last week have shown that households are reining in their spending because many families have reached the limit of their spending and are trying to consolidate their budgets. The September quarter financial accounts revealed that household debt in Australia stands at a record $818 billion, and debt as a proportion of household income continues to rise. As a percentage of disposable household income, household debt is now a record high of 154.7 per cent, up from 85.5 per cent in March 1996. Household debt in Australia is among the highest in the developed world, which means even a small percentage increase in interest rates will create financial hardship for many families. </para><para>Some of the debts are a direct result of government policy. I, like many members of the House, have had numerous complaints about the family tax benefit system. Under the current system, many families each year have been slugged with debts or have had payments clawed back at tax time or they have not received the benefit of the payments they were told they would receive. The government's refusal to correct the family payment system, which cannot pay families the right amount when they need it, limits parents' ability to balance work and family. Increasing family payments for some families, without fixing the flaws in the system, has resulted in this money being clawed back at tax time or their not receiving the full benefit of the announcements.</para><para>On top of a family tax system that places people into debt, the government has also been increasing the amount of money people pay for services. The GST clearly increased the cost of basic goods and services but there have been additional rises. The so-called reforms to Medicare, which I do not think are sustainable in terms of the safety net, from the health budget's point of view—but we will live to see what happens in relation to that—have seen an increase in the amount people have to pay to see a doctor. The changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme have seen people having to pay more for pharmaceuticals. The approval by the government to Telstra has seen the cost of line rentals on telephones skyrocket, and there is more. There is the cost for people of sending their kids to university, if they are lucky enough to find a place, the increased costs of child care—if, again, they are lucky enough to find a place—the cost of petrol, the cost of utilities that have now mostly been privatised and the cost of basic goods like food.</para><para>People are experiencing significant financial insecurity. The government has been moving strongly down the path of user pays—regardless of income—at the same time as increasing taxes. It is not just one small sector of the community; many sectors are finding it hard. Older people on fixed incomes, particularly those that do not own their own their homes, single people on low incomes struggling to pay debts and get ahead and families who, on top of all the issues mentioned previously, are trying to find the money to pay for their family tax benefit or child-care rebate debt are all finding it difficult under this government.</para><para>The great shame is that the Howard government is squandering the economic growth of the last 20 years and has eroded the foundations on which it was built. One of the issues we are going to hear a lot more about from industry and also from local councils, which are desperately concerned about what is happening to their future economic growth, is the skills crisis. There is a skills crisis in this country and it has happened during this government's watch. We live in a skilled and global economy. The Australian economy cannot grow and prosper as it has over the past 20 years without a skilled and dynamic work force. It is therefore alarming that, despite the Howard government's rhetoric on its good economic management, they are failing to provide Australia with its next generation of builders, carpenters, engineers, town planners, teachers and nurses. </para><para>Regional businesses, economies and families are feeling the effect of Australia's skills shortage right now. Regional Victoria has an even higher number of professions and industries experiencing a skills shortage than metropolitan areas. Regional economies have overcome many difficulties to survive and succeed in modern Australia. They have had to be more resourceful, dynamic and flexible to compete with many of the metropolitan businesses. Regional economies are often the first to feel the brunt of any economic reforms undertaken by governments.</para><para>One company in my district is having to bring in skilled boilermakers from China, as the local economy does not have the skills base to fill vacancies. DIMIA will be visiting my electorate shortly to meet with local businesses, to talk to them about how they could use temporary skilled work visas. This is at the same time as we have record levels of teenage unemployment in my community. There is something seriously wrong with a government that, during its nine-year watch, has allowed teenage unemployment rates to rise to the extent that they have and a skills shortage to exist. There is something seriously wrong with a government that has allowed an economy to emerge in regional and metropolitan Australia where that can happen.</para><para>Last month's skills vacancy index released by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations buttresses the experiences in my electorate. We are experiencing a skills crisis in key sectors of our economy. In the 12 months ending January 2005, skilled vacancies in the professions are up 5.3 per cent, while in the vital information and communications technology sector vacancies are up 63.7 per cent over the same period.</para><para>Over the past 12 months, the professions worst affected by the Howard government's skills crisis include those in building and engineering and health, which is up 3.8 per cent; accountants and auditors; organisation and information technicians; and science professions. These are the very sectors of our economy that will drive economic growth in Australia and assure that we remain a competitive force in the global market. These are the very sectors where the jobs for the next generation of Australians will be and these are the jobs that will allow tomorrow's Australians to enjoy the lifestyle that many of us enjoy today.</para><para>The Howard government has been asleep and policy lazy on this key economic issue. The problem has not even begun to be fixed, when we see that teenage unemployment is at record levels and thousands of people are being turned away from TAFE and universities. The gap between teenage unemployment rates in regional Victoria and inner city Melbourne is widening for four out of five regional districts which are suffering from increases in unemployment. Opportunities for younger Australians are not being created, despite the well-known skills shortage in regional Victoria.</para><para>My own electorate of Ballarat is the worst affected region. The Barwon West district, which covers Geelong, Ballarat and right up to the South Australian border and also covers Warrnambool, recorded a teenage unemployment rate of 34 per cent, compared to just 4.8 per cent in inner city Melbourne. Such a divide is totally unacceptable and is not affordable if Australia wants to maintain its competitiveness in a global economy. It is not just the level of teenage unemployment that is concerning but the speed at which it is occurring. In the Barwon West district we have seen a 10 per cent increase in the space of only a few months. Regional labour markets are suffering a skills shortage, yet we have large numbers of teenagers turned away from TAFE each year. The government's proposal to fix this is totally inadequate for the size of the problem. </para><para>Australian technical colleges in 24 regions across this country are not going to fix this problem. In my own electorate, I would have to say that the idea of a technical college is too little, too late. The government has the opportunity to do something about this immediately and that is to put more money into the TAFE system, straight away. Most communities, in order to get these Australian technical colleges, need to go through the expression of interest process and also have to wait at least two years before they come on line.</para><para>Most communities that have been offered these Australian technical colleges are really grappling with what the government means by them. I know, having seen the Warrnambool proposal, that they have very clearly said, `We've already got the infrastructure in place for this thing. What we are going to do is set up a virtual college.' I do not know if that is quite what the government had in mind when it announced these Australian technical colleges but we will wait and see. I suspect they are pretty keen to open a building with `Warrnambool technical college' on the front.</para><para>But even more bizarre is the total lack of transparency about where these are located and on what basis they have been located. Bendigo and Geelong in Victoria are being targeted for an Australian technical college. Ballarat is not. Where is the transparency in terms of why you are putting these things in Bendigo and Geelong and not necessarily putting something like that in Ballarat or addressing the skills shortage there?</para><para>I know the Mayor of the City of Ballarat will be visiting Canberra tomorrow. He has been trying for some time to see Minister Hardgrave about this issue and about the skills shortage issue in particular. Ballarat has a different model—it is not the Australian technical colleges model, because they do not think that is going to work and it certainly will not work in my electorate—that they would like to put to the minister. They cannot even get an appointment. That is how much the minister is interested in assisting regional economies and trying to help with both the skills shortage and teenage unemployment.</para><para>In the remaining time I have in this debate I want to turn to some of the local projects that have a major impact on our local economy. I have talked before in this place on the AusLink bill about the Deer Park bypass. It is absolutely extraordinary that, in the context where you have a road that has the highest cost-benefit ratio of any road project not just in Victoria but in the country, so little progress has been made. A feasibility study has been done for the route of the road. It is sitting on a national highway, the second busiest freight route in the whole of this country—the Hume being the first. It is the major transport link between Melbourne and Adelaide. It takes all of those car components from western Victoria to Adelaide to the car industry there. It takes all the wine grapes and all of the other market and engineering components that are manufactured in Ballarat, to Melbourne and on to Adelaide. It is a major economic development issue in our district.</para><para>What we saw from the government during the election campaign was absolutely cynical politics. Ballarat was not a targeted seat during the last election. I hope that that is not the case at the next election. In terms of what the government promised and what it actually did in my seat, it did nothing. There were lots of promises during the election campaign and lots of hope. `We're going to fund the Deer Park bypass; it's a major economic issue; we know it's a priority.' The Treasurer was out there in 2001 saying it was the most important project in the whole of Victoria—and what happened? We saw the Treasurer go down to Geelong to a project that was not even on the radar screen two years ago. Its cost-benefit ratio is nowhere near that of the project in my electorate. He went down to Geelong and announced full funding for that project—and it is a Commonwealthstate shared project. </para><para>For the project in my electorate, one that sits on the national highway, we get $40 million for a $294 million project. It is not to start this year or next year but after the next federal election. The bill is going to pass the Senate. It will be 100 per cent responsibility for the Commonwealth. It was cynical politics and our community reacted extremely strongly to the inadequate promises made during that campaign.</para><para>What is talked about in relation to tolls is absolute hypocrisy. What is going to happen in terms of national highways and the Deer Park bypass in particular? My community is now faced with the prospect that, if it ever wants to get this project built—we have $40 million already promised in 200708 to start this project and cannot start until we know we have the money to finish it—it will have to go to the state government and to the private sector. We now have to ask our local councils to work together to find the huge shortfall that the Commonwealth has left, the huge responsibility it has dumped on us in relation to a national highway that used to be a 100 per cent responsibility of the Commonwealth. That means potentially that all of the communities along that national highway and every other national highway in this country will have to fund their projects via private partnerships, which will mean tolls. So it is total hypocrisy on the part of the government to be making statements about tolls. Communities, such as mine, along a national highway are now faced with the reality that the only way they can get their road maintained and funded is via tolls—and the government should be condemned for it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>238</page.no><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phillip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARRESI</name><name.id>ZJ6</name.id><electorate>Deakin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very proud not only to be the member for Deakin for the fourth time, but once again to be a member of the Howard government. The result of the 9 October election was gratifying and a real testament to the hard work that this government has put in throughout the last nine years. This is the government's fourth term, and I am elated to be given the opportunity to once again represent my electorate. The people of Deakin are an intelligent, thought-provoking group with a high level of interest in matters of local, state and federal public policy. Let me say that with their thought-provoking intelligence the people of Deakin put me to the test on a regular basis, and I am proud to say that. I am here to represent them again and to do the best I can for those who voted for me and for those who wanted to see me out, but of course that is the nature of our democracy.</para></talk.start><para>As I made my way around the electorate to meet members of the community and discuss the issues that matter to them, it was clear that above all people seek the ability to engage at many different levels. People want the opportunity to engage with their families and their community in a meaningful and practical way. But they also want security, security of income and jobs, so they can raise their children without the fear so prevalent elsewhere in the globe. They recognised that the Howard government could deliver on those expectations and aspirations.</para><para>As expected with a slender margin and occupying a strategic outer suburban location, Deakin was a target for extensive campaigns from numerous interest groups and left-wing lobby groups. I must say the tactics directed towards the government and towards me personally were at times excessive. While I welcome hard-fought campaigns, I was sickened to hear that a prominent Melbourne newspaper opinion writer had the gall to propose placing caged children outside my electorate office in order to peddle her agenda against detention centres and to gain guaranteed publicity. </para><para>Sadly, some of these wacky ideas were not confined to interest groups. The alternative government, the ALP, also came up with its own list—be it a job-destroying forest policy to appease the Greens or its Medicare Gold health care for the over 70s that would have surely bankrupted the health budget. The ALP's repetitive and simplistic attack on the health system was flawed, with little factual integrity. Indeed, the electorate did not think that Medicare was in need of saving and did not buy the propaganda that was put out by the Labor Party during the campaign.</para><para>There are of course pressing issues in health care and the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon. Tony Abbott, I believe, has been a breath of fresh air and a magnificent minister for health in the time that he has been in the job. He has been to the electorate to listen to the needs of general practitioners for after-hours clinics and to the need for a Medicare funded MRI facility. My electorate has been identified as an area that needs a Medicare funded MRI facility within its local public hospital. I am pleased that the local peak health organisation, Eastern Health, with my strong urging and support, has formally applied to have the service based at one of its local hospitals. I am confident, with the looming announcement of the successful tender, that the eastern suburbs will be a beneficiary of such an announcement, but we will have to wait and see.</para><para>The Australian public resoundingly rejected the social engineering principles expressed by the left-wing intelligentsia behind the ALP. I am pleased to see that some of those left-wing elements have been pushed aside in the most recent reshuffle—although of course we do not know how many more reshuffles there will be between now and the end of the year. I for one know that by and large my constituents are concerned about the issues that matter most to their lives—namely, keeping the household budget in check, having a real choice about where to send their kids to school, having a real choice of where and how to obtain medical services, knowing that they can afford their mortgage and knowing that there are job opportunities for them and their families. These are the things that concern them. These are the things that we addressed. These are the things that we have directed our policy attention to over the last nine years, and we will continue to do so in the next term.</para><para>In the lead-up to the election it was fascinating to view local small business men and women interact with the Prime Minister when he visited Deakin on various occasions. They raised myriad issues from import duties to taxation concessions, to GST and to industry partnerships. All of these issues attracted active and healthy debate. However, they were all dwarfed by the most unanimous support for reform of the unfair dismissal laws. The government's failed attempts to reform unfair dismissal laws for small business has been a thorn in the side of the government. Small business owners and operators were vocal in their opposition to Australia's draconian one size fits all approach to unfair dismissal. This is an area that must be addressed by the current parliament, and I am encouraged by the announcement by Minister Andrews of further reforms in the workplace relations area which will aim to do just that and more.</para><para>At present in Australia we are experiencing low unemployment rates—the lowest unemployment rate in a generation. However, successful economic indicators should not prompt a government to rest on its laurels. I was also encouraged by the Prime Minister's comments only this week regarding the establishment of national awards and changes to federal-state industrial relations. The current system of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission also needs to be addressed. </para><para>One thing that I will be pushing forward, and certainly making appeals for in this term, is for us to look at the entire Industrial Relations Commission set-up. It was established over 100 years ago when federal-state relationships were very prominent and it was feared that the place of the states would be under threat by a federal government. We are now entering our second century. The Industrial Relations Commission is over 100 years old. We should be looking to see whether or not the current Industrial Relations Commission meets the needs of a modern, vibrant Australia that needs continuing productivity and industrial relations reforms. As a start, one thing we could do is look at the British Low Pay Commission rather than the current system, which allows the Industrial Relations Commission to be the arbiter of salary and wage decisions.</para><para>Today we were fortunate to see the Victorian government finally apply the National Code of Practice for the Construction Industry and the Australian Government Implementation Guidelines. This is an important step forward and a positive way of tackling reform in the $46 billion construction industry. It is an industry that has too long been blighted by corruption and thuggish tactics.</para><para>Another issue that popped up regularly throughout the election, and which has continued due to the emphasis given to it by the minister since we have returned, is that of vocational education. Vocational education is an issue of huge importance, not only in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne but throughout Australia, in particular the growing skill shortages in traditional trades. We have seen communities, parents and industry warm to the government's pronouncements on addressing vocational education needs.</para><para>Over the last 8½ years there has been a 181 per cent increase in the number of new apprenticeships in Deakin. There are 1,900 more places available than there were in the dying days of the former Keating government. Growth in this sector does not occur by accident or by fortuitous circumstance. The government has worked hard and has invested heavily in new apprenticeships. In the 2003-04 year alone, over $7½ million worth of incentives were allocated to Deakin to assist businesses in taking on apprentices.</para><para>During the last term, the Prime Minister visited the Starr automotive workshop in Blackburn to launch the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry new apprenticeships centre. This centre was a magnificent achievement. However, it is glowingly evident how continually hard it is to entice school-age people into a trade. There are many factors behind this; the most significant is what I would term the `Macklineske' ideal of `higher education or else'. That has created a cultural bias against entering a blue-collar profession. A key heartland to tackle this cultural bias is within the secondary school system and in the living rooms of most suburban homes.</para><para>To help facilitate this, I believe Minister Nelson has come up with a number of great ideas. One which is very specific to my electorate is when he came to launch the Automotive and Manufacturing Skills Centre at the Ringwood Secondary College. I have spoken about this before. I am proud of this achievement. The new centre operates in partnership with the Eastern Industry Education Partnership and targets its auto skills training to the transitional years between early adolescence and the end of secondary school. I am proud of this achievement because it was a federal government response to a need which the state government, the Bracks Labor government, specifically turned its back on—because they actually were approached on it. They were approached to submit the project through ANTA, and they turned their back on it. I am pleased that the federal government, and in particular Minister Nelson, came through and saw the centre up and running. This centre is available to schools across the eastern region of Melbourne and does not discriminate between government and non-government school students. </para><para>One of the things that I was astounded by during the last election campaign is that in the case of the most marginal coalition seat in Victoria—one which you would have thought the alternative government would have to win—Mr Latham failed to actually step into it. The opposition leader failed to enter into the electorate of Deakin. And no wonder. They did not have a good news story to tell. When you have people like Mr Latham and his education spokesman Jenny Macklin proudly announcing that they are going to cut funding to non-government schools, those sorts of wacky ideas did not resonate in the electorate. Although Labor did not propose to cut the funding to any of the major non-government schools in Deakin, several were going to have their funds frozen. It was a timely warning to parents and teachers that the ALP does not believe in a balanced educational system and real choice for families.</para><para>The second initiative from the Minister for Education, Science and Training which has received a lot of attention is the Australian technical colleges, which will provide a natural progression in the area of vocational training. Engaging the local training and industry communities in vocational education is paramount in ensuring the cultural bias against the blue-collar trades is tackled. The solution does not lie with governments telling our young school leavers that there is a shift in emphasis to trades. It lies in providing students and industry with a meaningful role in the future of training.</para><para>Since that announcement we have had Minister Hardgrave release a discussion paper in Deakin last month and I have met with local peak training bodies to discuss a possible eastern suburbs consortia for a local college. Those discussions continued as early as eight o'clock this morning when there was a meeting called by the Ringwood Secondary College with the local TAFE colleges, other schools and industry as well. They met on the premises of AAA, the Australian automotive vehicle premises, to discuss establishing a consortia. While the eastern region of Melbourne has been identified as a key area of need, the necessity for a strong proposal in or near Deakin is high. I am not going to stand up and say it has to be within my electorate. I recognise that as long as it is in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne it is going to be of great benefit to young people.</para><para>One of the first pieces of legislation to pass this new parliament was a $33 billion package, the largest ever investment in education by a government in Australia. It represents an increase of $9.5 billion over the current fouryear agreement. The significance of this package is the direct funding of schools and students for the areas of capital works and tuition. It is a notion that really appeals to the local community. Schools in the area are excited by this prospect. No longer do they have to wait for some state bureaucrat to decide whether or not the torn carpet, leaking roof or run-down toilet facilities warrant upgrade and maintenance. No longer do they need to push for another lamington drive in order to pay for this nor does the principal need to continue to pray for mercy from the Bracks state minister for education to receive attention. That is the kind of dilemma that some of these schools have been facing. I am pleased to see that this package has been welcomed in the electorate and I certainly will be pushing to see that the schools in the area that do need upgrades and capital works put their hands up and receive funding for much needed projects. </para><para>In the time that I have left I want to touch on an issue which has been dear to the hearts of most MPs of the eastern suburbs and which members on the other side are probably sick and tired of hearing us talk about—that is, the Scoresby Freeway. One cannot ignore the message that voters sent to the Labor Party about their deceitful backflip on tolls on the Scoresby Freeway. This was clearly the most emotive issue throughout the Deakin election campaign and it demonstrated that the ALP, at both the state and the federal level, simply cannot be trusted to represent the interests of our area. I was amazed to consistently hear the ALP simply dismiss the backflip as a state issue. I imagine this is also one of the reasons why Mark Latham, the then Leader of the Opposition, failed to come to the electorate of Deakin for the entire election campaign. He knew that if he crossed Middleborough Road, if he came down the Eastern Freeway and down Springvale Road, he would have been ambushed by a very irate community that felt they had been deceived by the state, and deceived by his announcement very early on in the election campaign. He did not even have the guts to make the announcement of the federal ALP's backflip in the electorate. He made the announcement in a radio studio. One of the opposition leader's first campaign announcements was to remove that $445 million. Quite simply, the ALP and their supporters that they bussed in for the campaign did not understand the issues that matter to this part of the world that I represent.</para><para>It is interesting to read today that the Victorian Minister for Transport, Peter Batchelor, is accusing the federal government of blackmailing the Bracks government through bilateral AusLink funding. Central to his argument is the need to honour the contract signed with the successful tollway consortium, ConnectEast. This is certainly a tall order from the only state transport minister in Australia to break a written, signed agreement between a state and the Commonwealth.</para><para>I observe with interest that the <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline> recently passed through the lower house. As I have already highlighted in this speech, the issues of roads and transport are key in Deakin. While the Bracks Labor government has backflipped on Scoresby, there are other prominent road issues in the eastern suburbs. In my electorate we have one of the worst traffic black spots in the entire state of Victoria—that is, the intersection of Springvale and Whitehorse roads in Nunawading, where there is a level crossing only 100 metres away. The need for action on this intersection is pressing. Not only is it the junction of two of the state's busiest roads, Springvale and Whitehorse roads, but also it has a level crossing and is going to be a feeder road for getting off and on the Eastern Freeway-Scoresby Freeway interchange.</para><para>There has already been a lot of money poured into that intersection by the federal and state governments, but there is an urgent need to address the problem in a more sustainable way. It is one of Melbourne's major north-south thoroughfares, which is used by approximately 125,000 vehicles per day. The level crossing services the two main eastern railway lines and accounts for 250 passenger trains a day. Springvale Road and the railway line clearly need to be separated. To their credit, the local Whitehorse City Council has recognised the importance of this and has conducted a feasibility study of grade separation of the site. </para><para>In light of the clear problem in the study undertaken by the council, the federal government has taken a lead role in addressing this issue by committing to sit down with the council, VicRoads and the state government to pursue how this intersection can be fixed. The council study came up with seven recommendations, ranging from additional traffic lanes to a large-scale undergrounding of Springvale Road. I welcome the upcoming meeting—which will take place in the next two weeks—between the council, officers from the Department of Transport and Regional Services and me to discuss the options for the site. I call on the Bracks government to get behind the project with funding of its own. It is absurd for the state Labor government and the state representative for Mitcham to consider any other local crossing ahead of Springvale Road.</para><para>There are a number of other projects in the Deakin electorate which I could talk about and no doubt there will be opportunities in the House to do so, but I want to end by paying tribute to the hundreds of community groups in Deakin for their tireless work in assisting the welfare of others. Whether their work be in local youth welfare, with the elderly, in the environment or in other valuable areas, these people do good work for our local community and make our life so much better. The recent Australia Day celebrations afforded me the privilege of honouring many of these local heroes with the Deakin Community Australia Day awards. I am pleased to have made those awards. I am pleased to once again be a member of the government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>243</page.no><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name><name.id>BV5</name.id><electorate>Lyons</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When I came into the House the member for Deakin was into one of his attacks on conciliation and arbitration in this country without any real understanding of the significant history or constitutional requirements. I do not think the member for Deakin likes working people very much. Most of us, like a lot of people, get pretty sick of that side of the House constantly attacking one side of the argument in industrial relations. The government is not going about this debate with fairness. It is a one-sided debate. I think the honourable member for Deakin has got a considerable amount to learn to have any understanding of fairness in the workplace.</para></talk.start><para>In my speech in the address-in-reply debate tonight, I must first thank the people of Lyons who gave me the opportunity to continue my work for them. I give my commitment that I will continue to put their interests first in my deliberations in this parliament, in the House of Representatives. We live in tremendously turbulent times with the world changing after the tsunami. Even if people have not had family involved in that, the feeling of anxiety and grief that has rocked the world has certainly touched all our lives. We have had our Labor leader fall sick in the middle of all this and, because so much else was happening, the fact did not sink into our consciousness until it became a major problem. Mark Latham felt he could not continue because of health issues and stood down.</para><para>I was very critical of Mark during the election campaign because of the way he rewrote the forestry policy without consultation and without reference to anyone in the industry. It cost us two seats in Tasmania and we lost the trust of many people in rural Tasmania. But many other parts of the policy had been carefully developed and could have been a healthy new direction, so I was disappointed that we did not have the option to work together again to change and improve our policies. I am sad for Mark that he had to stand down in the circumstances in which he did but I understand that his health and family must come first. I hope he finds his place in a different environment where he can still continue to contribute. </para><para>Now we again have Kim as our leader. It is a new start for the Labor Party to rebuild people's trust and confidence. At this stage Kim is giving us a great feeling of stability and strength while we really start to sort ourselves out. It is another challenge that we face in the year of the rooster, the year of new horizons, and I know my colleagues and I will be working hard to ensure there are lots of good ideas going out to our communities, to give them a chance to choose a better alternative to the current government. So during this year I will be talking to my communities around Lyons and asking them to continue their good work in advising me of what is wrong with this government's policy and how it is affecting them on the ground. This I will bring to the parliament. It will involve asking a few questions with their help, attempting to find answers to those important questions that will enhance this country, our work force, our seniors, our veterans and of course our young people.</para><para>During the election a number of very expensive promises were made by the government in its bid to retain office. I would now like to remind my colleagues opposite that, having made those promises, they are duty bound to keep them. Let us start with forestry. The federal government has now committed itself to a sum of $51 million in Tasmania over four years towards preserving some old-growth forest. There has been a lot of discussion about this, but still we have no idea where the money will be spent and how it will be distributed. So that is one thing I will be following with great interest. I do not believe we should lock up anything more. But there are areas that would benefit by having more funds spent on them to ensure their values are properly preserved.</para><para>The Bass Highway was promised $15 million to fund the upgrade at Sisters Hills. I would like to point out that my erstwhile colleague Sid Sidebottom got a commitment out of the opposition in 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2004 for funds to be committed to this project—and they were, without any strings attached. Now we have a situation where the federal government has copycatted and begrudgingly committed the $15 million but on the condition that the state government put in a contribution. This road is and should be part of the federal roads system and thus it should be funded under the federal roads budget without recourse to the state, which has the responsibility of course for all the other roads. What we have here is some petty politicking that is just going to delay the inevitable. In the meantime, the northwest coast people have to cross their arms, sit on the side and watch this silly endplay. On this, I say, `Get on with the job; no more procrastination; let's sort this road out now,' so I will be watching this with great interest.</para><para>While we are on the northwest there are a couple of little projects that have been raised by my friend Sid, who was always pestering the bean counters in the party for funds. The projects were the rhododendron gardens and, of course, the Axeman's Hall of Fame. The latter used to be in my electorate until the boundaries changed. I also fought for that to be funded and I am looking forward to seeing this important Tasmanian feature finalised. These are the sorts of projects that should be given high priority as they add to Tasmania's interest and prosperity.</para><para>I have been keeping my eye on the Bass electorate too. Our new member for Bass should be so busy handing out cheques that he will not even have time to attend parliament. If we are to believe all the money that was promised there, millions of dollars will flow into Bass. Talk about buying a seat. The budget purse had a hole in the bottom when it came to Bass. One of the promises was for a technical trades college. It appears there is to be an alternative TAFE that is propped up by industry. It seems a pity that there are no funds for existing training establishments but, according to a press release from the Minister for Education, Science and Training, he wants them to be run and managed a bit like non-government schools in that we do not want a centralised education bureaucracy to run them. This assumes that someone else will be picking up the tab for the administration, a favourite trick of this government: fund projects but let some other poor group pick up the expensive bit—administration, wages, safety issues, insurance et cetera—and just take the glory for the project. </para><para>This is typical of this government and can be seen in the Work for the Dole schemes and many other so-called community and privatised schemes. I am disgusted that this can be called fair and equitable when the many hopeful groups get slogged for those costs and therefore either go out of existence or have to find some other way of delivering the training side. The government would be better off funding the existing organisations and not worrying about the political correctness of privatisation. It does not do anyone or anything any good except the political rhetoric. Funding is needed in the VET area urgently and I can only hope that some of our enterprising teachers can use this program.</para><para>Then we have the $600,000 promise to establish regional business and development support—which is fine. This seems to be bankrolling two new positions and perhaps even developing a new export hub—which is not a bad idea. This might possibly help put some more funding into our freight needs out of the state, something that has been lacking for some time. The state has done the lion's share of this, so it is about time that the federal government put in and had a go at it.</para><para>Then there was some money for the setting up of the pulp mill—a mere $5 million—even though it may not be needed for the mill itself but rather for the infrastructure around it. I am not quite sure what is factored into this promise. Then, of course, there is the $3 million for the river bank improvements in Launceston, $1 million each for the swimming pools in Burnie and Devonport and $4 million for the Elphin Sport Centre, all adding up to a tidy sum in Bass and Braddon. These funds will be keenly awaited, and I will be waiting with great interest to hear their announcement throughout this year.</para><para>What about the $3 million promised for roads between Bridport and Scottsdale, Nunamara and Targa—just a snip to keep the road lobby at bay. These roads need money, so let's get on with it and get them sorted out. The Minister for Defence announced that the future of the Scottsdale Defence Research Centre was secure. I do not think it was under threat from us, so it must have been from the other side. But I am glad that these jobs are secure and I will keep an eye out to make sure that they do not disappear when the chooks start coming home to roost.</para><para>Now let us have a look at what was promised in my own electorate of Lyons. I am afraid the Liberal candidate has disappeared into thin air—it is a bit like where he came from—but they made these promises. Now I am chasing them up to provide this money and I am going to follow it right down until it is spent in my electorate. Firstly, there was the recycled $7 million for cleaning up the King River on the west coast. The old mine was dumping tailings straight into the river. This one has been around for a while and I was looking forward to work starting on the King, because there are many businesses in Strahan that would benefit from this clean-up. They said it would go ahead immediately. I have not seen anything yet, and I was only over there on Australia Day for celebrations at the miners' picnic. I rode the Apt Railway over—the first miners' train for 42 years to go to the picnic. It was good to relive that old tradition. I guess the government must have gone on holiday, because they have not started that work on the King River yet, but it was promised to start immediately. </para><para>We were also promised $100,000 for the Lyell districts war memorial hall, which would be an added bonus for Queenstown if it comes off. I look forward to that coming in. They also promised $15,000 for a skate park in Queenstown. The kids will be pleased to see that. I have been meeting with them on and off over the last couple of years to help them choose an area and start a bit of fundraising so that they have something to contribute and are a part of it, as I have done in many communities around the Lyons electorate. So the kids will be waiting and looking forward to that. I talked to a few the other day—they are looking forward to getting their skate park. I do not think they will see the Liberal candidate again, but I am sure that one of the other government members or the minister will turn up with the skate park funding.</para><para>Then there was $1.7 million for the Trail of the Tin Dragon, going from Bass, running into Lyons and picking up the old tin trail where a lot of the Chinese who came to Tasmania in the 1800s mined for tin. And a great joss house which sits in the museum in Launceston could be returned to the north-east in some sort of display—it would certainly build into our tourist attractions in that part of the state, where the state government is putting in a lot of effort and a lot of infrastructure. I look forward to seeing this happen and I look forward to the $15,000 which has been promised for the feasibility study. The sting in the tail, of course, is that, if the study does not recommend that it go ahead, the $1.7 million will not be forthcoming. So there are some weasel words in that to be sorted out, but I will certainly be raising that again.</para><para>What else was there? I remember a little article in the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> newspaper on 5 October entitled `Funds to rain on Hagley School'. A bit like rain, this is all that happened. This little pocket of gold was to shore up Senator Barnett's old school at Hagley to do up the accommodation for visiting schoolchildren and to build an interpretation centre to promote the deeper understanding of sustainable agriculture. That is good stuff and I support it. It is interesting how these little things work. I am not deriding the school; it is a very good school, providing a great service to the community. There are many that could do with these sorts of funds to help them develop additional resources. I hope Senator Barnett does not stop at this one. I will be watching and reminding him of his commitment.</para><para>I note there was an interesting selection of projects in the south. New Norfolk features quite heavily in the promises too. We can add those local figures to the list of national promises of which Tasmania is a beneficiary. I would say there are a lot of projects coming to Tasmania as a result of the Liberals' election commitments. But we will not see any additional help for our hospitals. We are not putting funds into getting more doctors and specialists trained in our universities. We are having universities put up their fees again to get the courses on, and working people are still trying to work out whether they can afford private health insurance or to register their car. Much of this money, although welcome in itself, is not dealing with the huge number of problems faced by Tasmanians every day. What about the one call zone for Telstra? What about decent reception statewide for the ABC and SBS? What about access to the mobile phone system and broadband technology? The only thing we are hearing about at the moment, of course, is that Telstra is to be sold. </para><para>It is time to do the sums and actually start doing what a federal government is supposed to be doing, such as getting on with delivering a national bushfire strategy. We just had the COAG report dropped by the Prime Minister. A heck of a lot of issues came out of the bushfire inquiry, of which I was the deputy chair, after the disaster in Canberra. We still have not got a national strategy in place, and we are just about through the end of this year's bushfire season—a great neglect by this federal government. We have got to sort out our departmental information systems so that people with mental health problems will not get lost in the system, and we have got to deal with the health and education problems that exist in this country.</para><para>My commitment for this term is to watch the promises made and make sure that they are kept, to continue my rounds of the Lyons electorate to ensure that everybody who has a problem can get access to me in my office, to let people know what is available through the federal government assistance programs for their communities and to make sure that the government meets its commitments made at the last election.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>247</page.no><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name><name.id>HK6</name.id><electorate>Herbert</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We had an election late last year and I was privileged to be returned for the fourth time as the member for Herbert. I very much appreciate the vote of confidence that I received from members of my electorate. During the election campaign, I certainly was able to promise a number of very important programs for the seat of Herbert, and I am going to deliver—not like the former speaker. I do not know what his position is, but I am certainly going to deliver.</para></talk.start><para>Let me run through the major commitments that I made. We are going to have an Australian technical college in Townsville, and I would like to report to the parliament tonight that I think we are going to have the first in Australia. I have had tremendous support from the local authority, the City of Thuringowa, who have taken the lead role in making sure that all the community comes together and puts in a bid that is going to succeed. We are certainly very hopeful of being able to start in the beginning of 2006, in 12 months time. There are some processes to go through between now and then, but I have great confidence in the groups that are involved in the consortium that is being put together.</para><para>I thank Mayor Les Tyrell for his and his council's commitment to making the Australian technical college happen. It is very important. With the skills shortages in the north, particularly in the mining and construction industries, we desperately need more people trained. I thank the principals of the local high schools who have also very enthusiastically embraced the concept of an Australian technical college because they want to see a pathway that is school to work through skills training. I think we are going to get a great outcome.</para><para>Another commitment that I am going to deliver on is the tropical science research precinct at James Cook University. You can say that pretty quickly, but what does it mean? It means that within 10 years James Cook University will be one of the top five tropical universities in the world. That is where we are going as a result of the commitment that I have made to the electorate, and I am very proud of that. Part of the tropical science research precinct will be what are now the reef and rainforest CRCs. They are likely to take on a new name when their current funding runs out, but they will continue. The precinct will include the CSIRO, the Australian Institute of Marine Science and of course James Cook University.</para><para>On top of that, just to show that I have been working very hard, we are going to have the first new veterinary science undergraduate degree in any Australian university in years. But like the television commercial, there is more: there will also be a tropical agricultural science degree. That will all link in with the medical precinct at James Cook University, particularly vet science. You understand, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, the shortage of vets in regional Australia and the threat of diseases that are coming in down the cape. We need to be on guard for Australia. Biosecurity issues are very significant, and we need local vets trained to look after those sorts of issues. We are going a step further forward with this particular degree by looking at zoonosis—the transfer of diseases in animals to diseases in humans. That will link into the medical school. So the foresight and vision that are there will certainly set up James Cook University to be a very significant university in the years ahead. </para><para>With respect to another of our election commitments, I am proud to say that I have secured almost $6 million for the Great Green Way project. Townsville to Cairns is a tourism region in Australia that should not be missed. The philosophy of this program is not just to get tourists to Cairns, Townsville or somewhere in between but to get tourists to experience the region. Cairns has some significant attributes that Townsville would like to be part of, and of course Townsville has significant attributes that Cairns would like to be part of. Under the Great Green Way project, which is the linkage between Townsville and Cairns, we will be able to share our tourists and that is very important for both ends of the region.</para><para>There are some very significant tourist attractions in North Queensland, and of course the major tourist attraction is the weather. Townsville has 300 days of sunshine every year, but there is a negative: it does not rain, so Townsville can be brown from time to time. But that is fine. The dry tropics are an experience.</para><para>Cairns is the reverse, with the rainforest and the wet tropics. We have the World Heritage area in the rainforest and the World Heritage area in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Those two World Heritage areas meet and you can stand in two World Heritage areas at the same time. We have got it in North Queensland! We have some very significant other attractions such as the Undara lava tubes, the longest lava tubes in the world, sitting north-west of Townsville, south-west of Cairns. They are an awe-inspiring experience. This $6 million program will be money wisely spent by the tourism and development bodies in the north and will bring great benefits to the region.</para><para>But there is more. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you will also understand this: I have secured a commitment from the Department of Defence to continue on immediately with the stage 4 upgrade of Lavarack Barracks. You have been to Lavarack Barracks on many occasions. You know that the barracks, which were built in the 1960s, need to be refurbished. We are currently doing stage 3. Stage 4 will be another $175 million pumped into the Townsville economy in the refurbishment of, principally, 4 Field Regiment and also 3 Combat Engineer Regiment, Lavarack Barracks. To have that kind of money circulating in the economy will mean pretty full employment and prosperity for the people of Australia's largest tropical city.</para><para>There is more. I had a look at what was needed for road projects in the region and how, by spending Commonwealth money, we could best improve traffic flow through the region. To the surprise and delight of many, I secured $40 million for the completion of the Townsville ring-road. When the existing Douglas arterial road is finished and opened at the end of March—in about seven weeks—that will make a mighty change to the traffic flows in the city and bring great convenience to the residents of the Upper Ross. This new Townsville ring-road project will connect the end of the Douglas arterial road through to the northern Bruce Highway and will open up the access roads from the north into the university, the hospital and Lavarack Barracks and the reverse. That is an absolutely great result. </para><para>I would like to pay a tribute to the men and women of Australia's Defence Force based in Townsville. In the break when the parliament was up, we had several deployments overseas. We saw Alpha Company of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment deploy in 18 hours, from being on Christmas holidays to being on the ground in the Solomons in response to the death of Adam Dunning in Honiara. I guess it shocked people who did not want to obey the law in Honiara when they saw 100 soldiers from the 1st Battalion arrive within 18 hours of that event.</para><para>Those people are the most professional people, the most dedicated people. I farewelled them. I saw the families. It was two days before Christmas, but the wives said to me, `Look, it's my husband's job. I understand. He goes with our best wishes. We'll have Christmas when he comes back,' and they did. I was privileged not only to farewell the 1st Battalion soldiers but also to welcome them home again. I was also privileged to welcome home soldiers who came back from Iraq, as I was to farewell 11 Brigade who went to the Solomons and 11 Brigade who went on another exercise that we do not talk about for security reasons. It was a magic experience to be there. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek to continue my comments when the debate is resumed.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Main Committee adjourned at 7.31 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></maincomm.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions in Writing</type><title>QUESTIONS IN WRITING</title><page.no>250</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra</title><page.no>250</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 21)</subtitle><id.no>21</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>250</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Murphy</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 17 November 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Has the Minister seen the article by Ian Royall titled “Telstra late fee faces legal fight” in the Herald-Sun on 25 November 2003 which reported that Telstra had announced that in March 2004 the penalty for the late payment of bills would rise from $5.50 to $11 for bills of $130 or more.</para><para>(2)	Has the Minister seen the article by Kirsty Needham titled “Push to lift electricity late fees” in The Sydney Morning Herald on 8 December 2003 which reported comments by the Chair of the Australian Consumers Association, Mr Chris Field, to the effect that the Telstra late-payment fee might be unlawful and that companies can only charge a fee that represents the actual cost to them of the consumer's default, rather than an amount that would be construed as a penalty.</para><para>(3)	Can the Minister confirm that Telstra has recently doubled its late-payment fee for bills exceeding $130;

In accordance with statutory requirements, the Government has commenced a review of matters relating to the end of the moratorium on the allocation of new commercial television broadcasting licences, which concludes on 31 December 2006. The question of whether any further commercial television licence should be issued after 2006 will be one for the government of the day.</para><para>(3)	A large and diverse range of content is offered by subscription television providers, including Foxtel.

ASTRA estimates, based on an estimated average of 3.4 residents in a typical subscription television home, that the penetration rate in Australia for subscription television is 26.1%.</para><para>Therefore, between 73% and 79% of television viewers rely on free-to-air television alone.

The Senate's advice and consent is subject to the following understandings, which shall apply to the obligations of the United States under this Convention:</para><para>(1)	(a)	That with reference to article 1, the United States understands that, in order to constitute torture, an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering and that mental pain or suffering refers to prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from (1) the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering; (2) the administration or application, or threatened administration or application, of mind altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality; (3) the threat of imminent death; or (4) the threat that another person will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or application of mind altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality. </para><para>	(b)	That the United States understands that the definition of torture in article 1 is intended to apply only to acts directed against persons in the offender's custody or physical control.</para><para>	(c)	That with reference to article 1 of the Convention, the United States understands that `sanctions' includes judicially-imposed sanctions and other enforcement actions authorized by United States law or by judicial interpretation of such law. Nonetheless, the United States understands that a State Party could not through its domestic sanctions defeat the object and purpose of the Convention to prohibit torture.</para><para>	(d)	That with reference to article 1 of the Convention, the United States understands that the term `acquiescence' requires that the public official, prior to the activity constituting torture, have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.</para><para>	(e)	That with reference to article 1 of the Convention, the Unites States understands that non-compliance with applicable legal procedural standards does not per se constitute torture.</para><para>	(2)	That the United States understands the phrase, `where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture,' as used in article 3 of the Convention, to mean `if it is more likely than not that he would be tortured.'</para><para>(3)	That it is the understanding of the United States that article 14 requires a State Party to provide a private right of action for damages only for acts of torture committed in territory under the jurisdiction of that State Party.</para><para>(4)	That the United States understands that international law does not prohibit the death penalty, and does not consider this Convention to restrict or prohibit the United States from applying the death penalty consistent with the Fifth, Eighth and/or Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, including any constitutional period of confinement prior to the imposition of the death penalty.</para><para>(5)	That the United States understands that this Convention shall be implemented by the United States Government to the extent that it exercises legislative and judicial jurisdiction over the matters covered by the Convention and otherwise by the state and local governments. Accordingly, in implementing articles 10-14 and 16, the United States Government shall take measures appropriate to the Federal system to the end that the competent authorities of the constituent units of the United States of America may take appropriate measures for the fulfilment of the Convention.</para><para>	III.

The Government's previous requests for access to ICRC reports were refused by both the United States and the ICRC on the grounds of confidentiality. We have previously asked the US to take any reports into account in its investigations into the treatment of Mr Hicks and Mr Habib and would expect this report to be taken into account as well.</para><para>(3)	During conversations with Australian officials, members of the United States administration have flatly rejected the ICRC claim that the treatment of Guantanamo Bay detainees is tantamount to torture describing it as inaccurate and disingenuous.</para><para>(4)	The Government is aware of allegations that Mr Hicks and Mr Habib have been subject to abuse while in the custody of the United States.</para><para>(a)	The allegations are that Mr Hicks was beaten by United States military personnel after his capture and during interrogation in Afghanistan.

In relation to paragraph (b), the `other circumstances' referred to in the question are not clear. However, Australia will abide by its obligations under Article 15 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</para><para>(7)	Article 15 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment speaks for itself.

The Senate's advice and consent is subject to the following reservations:</para><para>(1)	That the United States considers itself bound by the obligation under article 16 to prevent `cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment', only insofar as the term `cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment' means the cruel, unusual and inhumane treatment or punishment prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth, and/or Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</para><para>(2)	That pursuant to article 30 (2) the United States declares that it does not consider itself bound by Article 30 (1), but reserves the right specifically to agree to follow this or any other procedure for arbitration in a particular case.</para><para>	II. The Senate's advice and consent is subject to the following understandings, which shall apply to the obligations of the United States under this Convention:</para><para>(1)	(a)	That with reference to article 1, the United States understands that, in order to constitute torture, an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering and that mental pain or suffering refers to prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from (1) the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering; (2) the administration or application, or threatened administration or application, of mind altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality; (3) the threat of imminent death; or (4) the threat that another person will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or application of mind altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality. </para><para>	(b)	That the United States understands that the definition of torture in article 1 is intended to apply only to acts directed against persons in the offender's custody or physical control.</para><para>	(c)	That with reference to article 1 of the Convention, the United States understands that `sanctions' includes judicially-imposed sanctions and other enforcement actions authorized by United States law or by judicial interpretation of such law.

Accordingly, in implementing articles 10-14 and 16, the United States Government shall take measures appropriate to the Federal system to the end that the competent authorities of the constituent units of the United States of America may take appropriate measures for the fulfilment of the Convention.</para><para>	III.

It is not possible to predict how long the trial will last once it begins.</para><para>(11)	On 6 January 2005 United States authorities informed the Government that they would not charge Mr Habib.
