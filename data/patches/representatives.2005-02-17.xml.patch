It helps to stabilise the medical indemnity insurance market so insurers can continue to offer viable products into the future. Patients also benefit from the security offered to doctors in the medical indemnity insurance industry.</para><para>All of the measures in the medical indemnity package announced in December 2003 have been implemented. However, the government has continued to work closely with doctors and insurers to improve their operation. This bill is the result of these ongoing consultations.</para><para>The bill amends the definition of when a medical indemnity insurer knows of a claim so that this is treated consistently. The definition of a claim is amended to ensure that costs incurred by insurers in managing future claims can be paid as intended. This change will mean that insurers can be sure of reimbursement by the government for the costs of the retirement cover they are required to provide under ROCS.</para><para>Ongoing funding for the scheme is achieved through a payment by insurers called the run-off cover support payment. Insurers have indicated that the current formulation of the payment makes administration of the support payment difficult. To address this concern the definition of insurers' premium income will be changed so that it is considered net rather than inclusive of the run-off cover support payment.</para><para>Doctors will also have the proportion of their premium payment that represents the insurers' run-off cover support payment clearly and consistently identified on their invoice. This change will make apparent to doctors the contribution their insurer is making toward the provision of their free retirement cover under ROCS.</para><para>Further, to help insurers more accurately predict the level of reinsurance they require the applicable threshold for a claim will be tied to when the incident was notified, not when a claim is paid.</para><para>As in other medical indemnity schemes, a protocol for dealing with claim payments, costs associated with incidents notified and other matters has been introduced for the High Cost Claims Scheme. A regulation-making power has also been introduced so that any further changes to the scheme's payability rules can be made if required.</para><para>This bill demonstrates the ongoing commitment of the government to the medical indemnity industry, doctors and patients. The government will continue to consult with insurers and doctors to ensure the effective operation of the medical indemnity industry assurance support system into the future.</para><para>I congratulate the Minister for Health and Ageing, his office and the Department of Health and Ageing for continuing to address this complex and difficult area for the benefit of the medical profession and, of course, the general public. </para><para>I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Griffin</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2005</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>2</page.no><id.no>R2281</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>2</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Nelson</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>2</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>2</page.no><name role="metadata">Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Dr NELSON</name><name.id>RW5</name.id><electorate>Bradfield</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Education, Science and Training</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I am pleased to announce that the majority of the new arrangements under Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future package for higher education reform came into effect on 1 January 2005 and the benefits of those reforms will become increasingly apparent over the next 12 months and well into the future.</para><para>This <inline ref="R2281">bill</inline> now before the House will honour a number of election commitments for new university places and funding across the country.</para><para>These commitments include $2 million in infrastructure funding for Charles Darwin University for improved information technology, $12 million in infrastructure funding for the establishment of a new school for veterinary science and agriculture at James Cook University, and 100 new radiation therapy places as part of the government's Strengthening Cancer Care package.</para><para>Other funding measures in this bill include 40 additional aged care nursing places, funding for an additional 12 medical places at James Cook University for the years 2005-09, an additional $16.5 million in National Institute funding for the Australian National University for 2005-07 and a transfer of moneys in relation to the establishment of the National Centre for Marine and Coastal Conservation at the Australian Maritime College's Point Nepean campus.</para><para>This bill also provides for a number of legislative housekeeping measures.</para><para>It will extend the eligibility for capital development funding grants to higher education providers listed in table B of the Higher Education Support Act 2003.</para><para>The bill will also ensure that, where a higher education provider who is subject to the tuition assurance requirements under the act ceases to be able to provide a unit of study, students will have their student learning entitlement and FEE-HELP balances re-credited.

It achieves this through scientifically evaluating and regulating agvet chemicals before they can be legally sold or used. As part of these responsibilities, the APVMA regulates agvet chemicals to the point of wholesale sale. The costs of the APVMA are fully recovered through the collection of application fees and a levy on leviable disposals of registered chemical products.</para><para>A national competition policy review of agricultural and veterinary chemicals legislation, completed in January 1999, made several recommendations about the APVMA's cost recovery arrangements. These were intended to remove potential hurdles to smaller businesses seeking registration and discrimination between firms in respect of their contribution.</para><para>As a result of these recommendations the APVMA cost recovery arrangements were reviewed. The government consulted extensively with industry and issued a draft cost recovery impact statement (CRIS) in November 2004. Analysis of the submissions received from stakeholders did not result in any significant changes to the cost recovery model outlined in the draft CRIS.</para><para>The amendments contained in this <inline ref="R2285">bill</inline> amend the following acts to implement the new cost recovery arrangements as set out in the draft CRIS:</para><para>	Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Levy) Act 1994;</para><para>	Agricultural, and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994; and</para><para>	Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992.</para><para>Key aspects of the bill include several changes to the levy such as:</para><para>	changing from a calendar year to a financial year basis, consistent with the period of registration of chemical products;</para><para>	providing for a tiered rate of levy to be set based on the volume of leviable disposals of a particular chemical product;</para><para>	removing the existing cap of $25,000 placed on the amount of levy that may be paid in respect of a particular chemical product in a particular year; and</para><para>	removing the existing thresholds below which no amount of levy is payable in respect of a particular chemical product, currently $100,000.</para><para>The bill also creates a new penalty for understating the amount of leviable disposals and amends several provisions in the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code to better reflect the modular system of fees and assessments.</para><para>In addition, the bill will repeal a suite of interim levy legislation that is now spent, namely:</para><para>	Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Interim Levy) Act 1994;</para><para>	Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products Interim Levy Imposition (Customs) Act 1994;</para><para>	Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products Interim Levy Imposition (Excise) Act 1994; and </para><para>	Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products Interim Levy Imposition (General) Act 1994.</para><para>The amendments contained in this bill bring the cost recovery arrangements for the APVMA into closer consistency with the government's cost recovery guidelines. They will also ensure that the APVMA continues to provide the valuable service of protecting Australia's human, animal and environmental health, whilst continuing farmers' access to a wide range of important chemical inputs.</para><para>I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ripoll</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BORDER PROTECTION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DETERRENCE OF ILLEGAL FOREIGN FISHING) BILL 2005</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>4</page.no><id.no>R2286</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>4</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Truss</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>4</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>4</page.no><name role="metadata">Truss, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TRUSS</name><name.id>GT4</name.id><electorate>Wide Bay</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>Illegal fishing in Australia's northern waters is a growing problem. This is demonstrated by the record number of illegal foreign fishing vessels apprehended in northern Australian waters—138 vessels in 2003 and a further 161 vessels in 2004. To date in 2005, over 18 suspected illegal foreign fishing vessels have been apprehended and detained, demonstrating the Australian government's determination to maintain the integrity of our borders and the sustainability of our fish stocks.</para><para>To manage the increasing number of illegal foreign fishers in Australian waters, a stronger regime is needed. In recognition of this, by the end of 2005 the Australian government will implement three significant new initiatives to boost our efforts against illegal fishing in our northern waters. Firstly, additional resources will be provided to the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to assist in the apprehension and prosecution of illegal foreign fishers. Secondly, the processing and detention arrangements for suspected illegal foreign fishers apprehended in Australia's northern waters will be clarified and strengthened. Lastly, additional resources will be provided to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to enhance its ability to monitor and protect Australia from potential quarantine risks posed by apprehended vessels.</para><para>It is vital that these new initiatives are underpinned by an effective and clear legislative framework. This will enable the Australian government to implement tougher measures and to send a strong message to illegal foreign fishers. The government is serious about protecting Australia's fisheries resources, and serious about apprehending those who seek to illegally plunder those resources.</para><para>The <inline ref="R2286">Border Protection Legislation Amendment (Deterrence of Illegal Foreign Fishing) Bill 2005</inline> will amend the Fisheries Management Act 1991, the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 and the Migration Act 1958 to ensure the effectiveness of Australia's border protection regime is not compromised by any inconsistencies between the relevant legislation. This bill is part of a whole-of-government approach to prevent illegal fishing activity in Australian waters and to improve Australia's general border protection arrangements. The proposed amendments to the Fisheries Management Act and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act will apply to all areas of Australia's maritime jurisdiction. </para><para>The majority of this bill concerns the implementation of a detention regime that is broadly consistent between the Torres Strait Fisheries Act and the Fisheries Management Act. The proposed amendments will ensure that there are appropriate powers relating to the detention and investigation of suspected illegal foreign fishers under fisheries legislation. It will also ensure consistency of detention arrangements between the fisheries and immigration portfolios, providing for a seamless transition between fisheries and immigration detention for illegal foreign fishers in Australia.</para><para>The first purpose of the bill is to amend the Torres Strait Fisheries Act in order to bring it in line with the Fisheries Management Act. These amendments are necessary as the patterns of illegal foreign fishing in our northern waters are clearly increasing. Illegal fishers are expanding their operations and are venturing further east towards and within the Torres Strait Protected Zone and further west around the south-west coast of Western Australia. It is important to both Australia and Papua New Guinea that a strong stance is taken against the illegal foreign fishers that pillage the natural resources of the Torres Strait. It is also necessary to take action against illegal fishers in the protected zone, in order to fulfil our international obligations under the Treaty between Australia and the Independent State of Papua New Guinea concerning Sovereignty and Maritime Boundaries in the area between the two Countries, including the area known as Torres Strait, and Related Matters, otherwise known as the Torres Strait treaty. The Torres Strait treaty established the Torres Strait Protected Zone as a zone of joint fisheries jurisdiction. These amendments are essential to protect the precious resources in the Torres Strait.</para><para>The Torres Strait Fisheries Act requires updating to allow for the adequate detention of persons involved in illegal foreign fishing offences. Currently, illegal foreign fishers intercepted in the protected zone are detained under the Migration Act as unlawful non-citizens suspected of an offence and can be held in immigration detention pending the completion of any prosecution. However, this bill will enable fisheries officers to exercise a power of fisheries detention for the specific purpose of investigating foreign fishing offences under the Torres Strait Fisheries Act. This provision will make the Torres Strait Fisheries Act broadly consistent with the Fisheries Management Act and ensure that adequate time is allowed to investigate suspected offences. These provisions and all amendments to the Torres Strait Fisheries Act are consistent with the Torres Strait treaty between Australia and Papua New Guinea.</para><para>The second purpose of the bill is to create a fisheries detention regime that is broadly consistent with current immigration detention arrangements. Currently, under the Fisheries Management Act, foreign fishers are detained by fisheries officers if they are suspected of being involved in an illegal fishing activity. An enforcement visa, under the Migration Act, is then automatically granted to such a person, which enables the fisheries officers to bring them into the migration zone for the purposes of investigating the suspected offence. By creating an enforcement visa regime to apply to the Torres Strait Fisheries Act, greater consistency is achieved in the management of fisheries offences committed throughout all Australian waters.</para><para>Upon the expiration of fisheries detention, the enforcement visa automatically ceases and the person assumes the status of an unlawful noncitizen and is detained under the Migration Act. Under the Migration Act, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs is required to remove unlawful noncitizens as soon as reasonably practicable. In the case of illegal foreign fishers, such persons would normally be repatriated within a short period of time after their apprehension and prosecution. </para><para>In order to facilitate the seamless transfer of detainees from fisheries to immigration detention, this bill will create a new class of officers, appointed by the minister, who may exercise limited powers relating to fisheries detention. This will allow employees and contractors of both AFMA and DIMIA to exercise detention powers under fisheries legislation. DIMIA currently employs contractors to perform immigration detention functions under the Migration Act. The new regime will allow for employees of such contractors to also perform fisheries detention functions under fisheries legislation. This amendment is necessary as illegal foreign fishers will be held in a single facility for some part of their detention in Australia, regardless of whether they are held in fisheries or immigration detention.</para><para>This bill also amends the Fisheries Management Act and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act to enable fisheries officers to exercise the same powers in relation to searches and screening of people to those that currently exist for people detained as unlawful noncitizens in an immigration detention facility. These powers include the capacity to conduct searches, strip searches and screening of persons. It is necessary to have a uniform regime for persons detained under all three acts. Since the transition from fisheries to immigration detention will be automatic, the applicable powers must be as similar as possible. Consistent powers between the three acts will avoid administrative complexities where one facility will accommodate a combination of persons held under the detention powers of three different acts. These powers will provide the necessary protection to officers and other detainees, as it will allow them to remove any weapons that the person may be concealing.</para><para>This bill also gives officers the capacity to collect personal identity information from detainees, for the purpose of identifying repeat offenders and factoring this into their prosecution. This proposed power is essential to ensure that fisheries officers have the capacity to adequately deal with recidivists. The bill will also allow this information to be passed to agencies that will become responsible for the detention, welfare and repatriation of the detainees. These amendments are broadly consistent with provisions in the Migration Act for the taking of biometric identifiers from immigration detainees.</para><para>The proposed new powers to search, screen and collect personal identification information will only apply to persons detained for the purpose of investigating foreign fishing offences and to screen their visitors. These procedures are also subject to strict controls, which are consistent with the Migration Act. These measures are important and necessary for modern fisheries legislation, which must cope with high levels of illegal activity and form part of a whole-of-government approach to strong border security. The bill provides for appropriate safeguards in the exercise of these proposed powers.</para><para>These new powers will only be exercised by officers who are specifically authorised to do so. An important part of the authorisation process will see any prospective officers receive comprehensive training in the effective and responsible use of these powers under the relevant acts. Detainees will at all times be treated with dignity and their welfare will remain an important consideration when exercising any powers under the legislation. </para><para>The third purpose of this bill is to allow officers to safely exercise their duties and perform their border protection functions. Officers and other persons exercising powers under fisheries legislation often have to operate in dangerous conditions. The Australian government has become increasingly concerned about the open displays of hostility that have been made towards fisheries officers by some illegal foreign fishers and is committed to ensuring that our legislative regime provides for their safety and protection.</para><para>The bill will amend the Fisheries Management Act and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act to broaden the offence of obstructing an officer to include other persons in the exercise or performance of any power, authority, function or duty under the act. This provision will provide a penalty and some assurances to those performing, or assisting officers in, their duties. This would include detention officers, translators, medical staff, AFMA officials and others that are involved in the administration of the fisheries legislation.</para><para>This bill also gives fisheries officers powers to search people on foreign boats suspected of committing fishing offences, in order to determine whether any evidence or dangerous objects are being held or concealed by the person. Enabling officers to examine and take possession of any items which may constitute evidence will prevent the possibility of people concealing evidence or throwing it overboard before they are detained. It will further ensure that illegal fishers are dealt with appropriately under fisheries legislation. These provisions will also enhance the safety of officers and other detainees once these people are detained, by allowing the confiscation of weapons or other dangerous objects.</para><para>The bill will also insert a new provision into the Fisheries Management Act and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act to prevent certain legal actions against officers, those assisting officers, and the Commonwealth, in cases where people are on vessels that are subject to directions by an officer. This is to put beyond doubt that any restraint on these people's liberty is lawful as it is a lawful direction by the officer to move to a place in Australia where suspected fishing offences can be properly investigated.</para><para>The final amendments proposed in this bill involve the introduction of forfeiture provisions in the Torres Strait Fisheries Act. This bill introduces automatic forfeiture provisions which are similar to those already contained in the Fisheries Management Act. This will allow for the automatic forfeiture of boats and other things used in foreign fishing offences (including specific provisions that detail how these things may be dealt with). At present, boats, gear and catch seized under the Torres Strait Fisheries Act can only be forfeited by a court. This amendment will allow patrol boats to intercept and seize gear and catch from illegal vessels in the Protected Zone. This will provide an additional, timely and cost-effective deterrent to illegal fishing activity.</para><para>The Border Protection Legislation Amendment (Deterrence of Illegal Foreign Fishing) Bill 2005 will provide for a consistent and seamless detention regime, from the time an illegal foreign fisher is apprehended within any part of Australian waters, to the time that they are passed to immigration detention and are awaiting repatriation arrangements. In addition, the bill will provide for the due safety and welfare of officers in the exercise of their duties and the detainees that are under their care.</para><para>It is vital that Australia maintains a robust but fair apprehension and detention policy for suspected illegal foreign fishers. This bill is an essential step in protecting Australia's natural resources and maintaining the integrity of our borders. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ripoll</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER 2004 ELECTION COMMITMENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>8</page.no><id.no>R2291</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>8</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Ley</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>8</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>8</page.no><name role="metadata">Ley, Sussan, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LEY</name><name.id>00AMN</name.id><electorate>Farrer</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary (Children and Youth Affairs)</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>This <inline ref="R2291">bill</inline> will amend the social security law, the family assistance law and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to provide for two further commitments made by the government before the 2004 election. These commitments are aimed at families with children and older Australians.</para><para>The first of these commitments is to increase the rate of family tax benefit part B. The bill gives effect to this by introducing a new family tax benefit part B supplement. The new supplement will be added to an individual's standard rate of FTB part B and will be payable as a lump sum on income reconciliation after the end of the income year in the same way as the family tax benefit part A supplement introduced last year.</para><para>The annual amount of the new supplement will initially be set at $302.95 for the 2004-05 income year. This amount represents a daily amount of 83 cents. As the family tax benefit part B supplement commences from 1 January 2005 and there are 181 days in the period 1 January to 30 June 2005, the maximum FTB part B supplement for that period would be $150.23.</para><para>The family tax benefit part B supplement will be subject to a one-off six-month indexation arrangement on 1 July 2005, which reflects its 1 January 2005 commencement, and then will be indexed on 1 July 2006 and each following 1 July according to annual movements in the consumer price index.</para><para>The second 2004 election commitment given effect by this bill is to exempt aged care accommodation bonds from the social security and veterans' affairs means test. The government is delivering this commitment in an easily understood manner that will provide elderly Australians with peace of mind and will afford them the opportunity to manage their transition to aged care.</para><para>Currently, where a customer pays an accommodation bond to an aged care facility, the refundable balance of the bond is held as an asset of the customer for means testing purposes. This may result in a reduction in the pension the customer receives from the government and may, in some cases, mean that a pension is no longer payable. These amendments will mean that many older Australians will be able to receive a higher rate of payment, or obtain a payment from the government that they would not otherwise have had.</para><para>These amendments will also allow customers who pay their accommodation bonds by periodic payments to rent out their former home, without the rental payments affecting their rate of payment from the government. Customers in this situation will also be able to retain the asset test exemption for their former home during any period in which they rent it out. This change mirrors existing concessions available to residents in high-level aged care who pay accommodation charges. </para><para>There will also be provision for customers who will now be eligible for either a social security or veterans' affairs payment because of these changes to have their payment backdated to 1 July 2005. The backdating will be available where customers apply to Centrelink or the Department of Veterans' Affairs for a payment prior to 30 September 2005 or, if they have special circumstances, to 30 June 2006.</para><para>In a separate measure, this bill repeals the existing formula for the family tax benefit child income cut-out amount for FTB. A child whose income equals or exceeds the cut-out amount cannot attract payment of family tax benefit.</para><para>The formula is being replaced with a specified amount of $11,233. This figure represents annual indexation of the existing amount for 2004-05 of $10,948. The new cut-out amount will apply from 1 July 2005 and will be indexed on 1 July 2006 and each following 1 July according to movements in the consumer price index.</para><para>The new amount is higher than the amount of $11,218 that would have been applicable from 1 July 2005 under the existing formula.

These minor amendments do not alter the broad substance of reform found in the previous bill.</para><para>The Dawson review is the most comprehensive review of the competition provisions of the act for a decade. After extensive and comprehensive consultation and consideration, the Dawson review concluded that the competition provisions of the act have served Australians well. The review committee made a total of 43 recommendations aimed at improving the operation of the competition and authorisation provisions, as well as the administration of the act. </para><para>The overall theme of the Dawson review is that the competition provisions should protect the competitive process, rather than particular competitors. The government strongly supports this view of the act, and has accepted the vast majority of the Dawson review recommendations.</para><para>The bill will improve existing Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) processes by providing for greater accountability, transparency, and timeliness in decision making and reducing the regulatory burden on business.</para><para>The major initiatives contained in the bill are as follows:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mergers</inline></para><para>There will be a new merger clearance process.</para><para>A voluntary formal clearance system will be created that will operate in parallel with the informal clearance system. The test for considering mergers will remain unchanged—section 50 of the Trade Practices Act will continue to prohibit mergers that would have the effect, or be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in a market.</para><para>The Dawson review found that the ACCC's informal system of merger clearance can be quick, inexpensive and flexible in many circumstances but identified a lack of certainty for business as a clear disadvantage:</para><para>	there is, necessarily, no statutory time limit on the ACCC;</para><para>	the absence of a meaningful appeals mechanism may allow the extraction of undertakings that go beyond the competition concerns of a merger;</para><para>	the lack of a legal requirement for the ACCC to provide reasons for its decisions prevents the development of a body of precedent; and</para><para>	ultimately, there is no certainty of immunity from legal action.</para><para>In response to these concerns, the Dawson review recommended that a voluntary formal clearance system operate in parallel with the existing informal system, thus providing business with options dependent upon their particular circumstances.</para><para>The informal system will continue to answer the needs of straightforward mergers. Parties to more difficult mergers will be able to utilise the informal system to address ACCC concerns but, when they are ready to proceed, the formal system will provide the certainty of legislated time limits, require the disclosure of reasons, allow the applicant to appeal to the Australian Competition Tribunal (the tribunal) and provide immunity from legal action should the clearance be granted.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Merger</inline><inline font-weight="bold"> Authorisations</inline></para><para>The Dawson review identified that dissatisfaction with the merger authorisation process has been largely attributed to concerns about the time which may be taken to reach a decision and the risk of third party intervention by the way of appeals to the tribunal.</para><para>These factors have rendered the authorisation process commercially unrealistic for many merger proposals, especially those involving publicly listed companies.</para><para>The bill provides that merger authorisation applications will be considered directly by the tribunal so as to ensure commercially realistic time frames for such applications, and to prevent strategic appeals by third parties. Third party interests will be considered as part of the tribunal's comprehensive assessment. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Non-Merger Authorisation</inline></para><para>The bill addresses the concerns of business regarding the sometimes expensive and protracted nature of the non-merger authorisation process by placing time limits on the ACCC for considering applications. Small business in particular is advantaged by providing the ACCC with the discretion to waive, either in whole or in part, the filing fee in appropriate circumstances.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Collective Bargaining</inline></para><para>This government acknowledges and supports the important contribution made by small business to the Australian economy.</para><para>The bill will reduce the regulatory burden on small business by introducing a notification process for collective bargaining by small business dealing with large business, as an alternative to the authorisation process.</para><para>In the absence of objection by the ACCC, the bill provides that collective bargaining arrangements will receive immunity at the end of 14 days for a period of three years. The government proposes that the period be initially set at 28 days by regulation, with a further assessment at the end of 12 months.</para><para>Subject to meeting the appropriate tests and procedural requirements, the ACCC will be able to issue an objection notice at any time after it has been notified of a collective bargaining arrangement, regardless of whether the 14- or 28-day period has elapsed and immunity applies.</para><para>The onus will be on the ACCC to provide notice that the small business collective bargaining arrangement does not, or is unlikely to, generate public benefits, or that those benefits will not outweigh the detriment resulting from the arrangement.</para><para>In considering public benefit and detriment, the ACCC will have particular regard to the government's intention that the collective bargaining provisions not be used to pursue matters affecting employment relationships. The act is for the promotion of competition and fair trading and the provision of consumer protection, not the pursuit of employee entitlements. This is further reinforced by an amendment which makes a notification invalid if it is lodged on behalf of a small business by a trade union, its officers or a person acting on the direction of the trade union.</para><para>The ACCC has already authorised collective bargaining arrangements, including those by chicken growers, dairy farmers, sugarcane growers and small private hospitals. However, the process of obtaining authorisation may be expensive, time consuming and impose an unnecessary burden on small business—in many cases notification will be an appropriate, effective and speedy alternative.</para><para>To ensure the collective bargaining process benefits small business dealing with large business, there is a transaction limit of $3 million in any 12-month period. However, it is recognised in the bill that there are businesses with high turnover and small profit margins, which should have a higher transaction limit, and the bill provides that a higher limit can be set by regulation.</para><para>The government considers there would be a range of businesses suitable for a higher limit. These could include motor vehicle dealers, petrol station owners and some agricultural businesses. The Minister for Small Business and Tourism is developing proposals for the government's consideration in respect of these regulations.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Exclusionary provisions, price-</inline><inline font-weight="bold">fixing provisions and joint ventures</inline></para><para>The act prohibits exclusionary and price-fixing provisions outright—that is, without regard to their actual impact on competition. The government considers that outright prohibitions should continue for clear cartel conduct. </para><para>However, the Dawson review found that the existing joint venture exemption contained in the act is too narrow to encompass many newer forms of joint ventures, such as those found in e-commerce.</para><para>The bill provides a joint venture defence to the prohibitions on exclusionary provisions and price-fixing provisions. Clear cartel conduct will continue to be prohibited outright but genuine joint ventures will be considered on the basis of a competition test. Authorisation on public benefit grounds will still be available for other joint ventures where appropriate.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Dual listed companies</inline></para><para>The modern occurrence of dual listed companies is recognised in this bill by allowing intraparty transactions in a dual listed entity to be treated on the same basis as related party transactions within a group of companies, and for the aggregate market power of the dual listed company to be assessable for the purpose of considering market power.</para><para>The formation of a dual listed company will be prohibited where it would substantially lessen competition in a market, with authorisation available in appropriate cases.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Third</inline><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">line</inline><inline font-weight="bold"> forcing</inline></para><para>Most exclusive dealing arrangements are only prohibited by the act if they substantially lessen competition. Third line forcing, which involves selling only on condition that goods are acquired from a third party, is, however, prohibited outright.</para><para>The Dawson review considered that third line forcing is often beneficial and pro-competitive. The ACCC presently opposes very few of the hundreds of third line forcing notifications received annually and has also found that these arrangements can encourage competition, such as the grocery shopper docket arrangements for cheaper petrol.</para><para>The bill amends the act to subject third line forcing to a substantial lessening of competition test, consistent with other forms of exclusive dealing.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Enforcement</inline></para><para>The ACCC is a vigorous and effective regulator. In recognition of the ACCC's extensive investigative powers and its potential to significantly disrupt business if these powers are not used appropriately, the Dawson review recommended greater transparency and accountability in the ACCC's enforcement mechanisms, and greater safeguards on the use of its extensive powers.</para><para>The current provisions in the act provide the ACCC with the power to enter premises and inspect documents without a warrant. This bill will provide the ACCC with the ability to search premises and seize evidence; however, these powers are matched with appropriate accountability by requiring the ACCC to obtain a warrant from a magistrate.</para><para>These amendments both enhance the effectiveness of the ACCC's investigative powers and also ensure accountability and transparency. The relevant rights and responsibilities of the ACCC and businesses subject to investigation are clearly specified.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Penalties</inline></para><para>The bill provides for higher penalties for contraventions of the competition provisions in part IV of the act, as a means of better deterring corporations or individuals from engaging in anticompetitive conduct.</para><para>The government has adopted recommendations made by the Dawson review which provide that the maximum pecuniary penalty for corporations be raised to be the greater of $10 million or three times the gain from the contravention or, where gain cannot be readily ascertained, 10 per cent of the turnover of the body corporate and all of its interconnected bodies corporate, if any. </para><para>The bill also gives the court the option to disqualify an individual implicated in a contravention of part IV of the act from being a director of a corporation or otherwise being involved in its management.</para><para>Corporations are also to be prohibited from indemnifying, directly or indirectly, their officers against the imposition of a pecuniary penalty or the legal costs of defending or resisting proceedings that seek such penalties. Loans and advances made by a corporation to its officers to assist them to defend themselves do not amount to indemnification, so long as the officer is required to repay the loan or offset the advance should they be found to have contravened part IV of the act and a pecuniary penalty is imposed.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Other measures in the bill</inline></para><para>In addition to implementing the major recommendations of the Dawson review, the act is amended to apply to local government consistently with other levels of government—that is, to the extent it carries on a business. The bill also implements measures to help ensure the constitutional validity of the act's national application, addressing uncertainties raised by the High Court in the Hughes case.</para><para>The Trade Practices Act is an essential component of Australia's regulatory framework, and this bill enhances existing measures in the act to provide greater accountability, transparency, timeliness and efficiency. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ripoll</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NAVIGATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13</page.no><id.no>R2235</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>13</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 9 December 2004, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>13</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to speak on the <inline ref="R2235">Navigation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> and to offer Labor's support for the changes to the legislation. The Navigation Amendment Bill 2004 proposes minor changes to the Navigation Act 1912, which is the principal act relating to navigation and shipping. The bill proposes changes in only a few areas, eight amendments in total. Essentially, the bill will remove any ambiguity in what are indictable offences in relation to the prevention of collisions and the display of lights and signals on ships. It will remove references to nautical assessors and strengthen penalties in relation to navigation near ice and obligations to render assistance to other vessels. The bill also proposes to remove superfluous parts of the act.</para></talk.start><para>Before I talk about specific amendments to the act, I would like to provide some context by taking a closer look at the Navigation Act 1912. It is a weighty tome of some 848 pages, but not quite up there with the tax legislation in this country, depending on whom you believe, which has some 9,000 or more pages. Taking a look at the Navigation Act 1912, it seems a pretty straightforward piece of legislation. It deals with the necessary certification of masters, officers and seamen; with the minimum complement of ships—the manning levels of ships; with wages, work conditions and so forth for seamen; with the provisions necessary on a ship; and with the health of seamen. Those are just a few aspects that the act covers.</para><para>On closer inspection, the act also has some very interesting parts. For instance, in division 2 the act outlines what we shall do with a drunken sailor at any time of the day or night. It also outlines what we shall do if a sailor contracts some unspeakable disease. It also outlines that there must be food of suitable quality, quantity, nutrition value and variety on board—one presumes to prevent the onset of scurvy and other similar ailments. </para><para>The act is a very important piece of legislation and is crucial to the shipping and maritime industry in this country. In recent times this has become a very topical piece of legislation for the industry. The shipping industry undertook a review in 2003, which speaks a lot about the act and the relevance it has for a modern industry. This review was conducted under the watchful eye of two respected former ministers for transport, John Sharp and Peter Morris. The report said this about the government's shipping policy:</para><quote><para>... if current Government shipping policy is maintained and the presence of Australian ocean-going shipping declines to about 30 vessels, then the industry's export income-generating activity contracts and imports of shipping substantially increase with a resulting negative impact on the balance of payments, the Australian exchange rate depreciates and resources move into export and import replacement activities, thereby reducing the capacity to supply goods and services for private consumption.</para></quote><para>That was quite a foresighted comment at that time, given our current account deficit and where this country is at the moment, particularly in relation to our exports and imports. The report also said this about skills within the industry:</para><quote><para>One of the most prevalent concerns in the Australian maritime sector is the real and genuine concern over a looming shortage of persons with prerequisite seagoing qualifications. The diminishing number of young persons being trained as seafarers in the Australian-controlled fleet is contributing to an ageing skills base.</para></quote><para>This sounds very familiar, given today's debate on skills shortages, efficiency, productivity and the neglect that has been going on for many, many years.</para><para>Debating the Navigation Amendment Bill 2004 presents a great opportunity for members of this House to consider the government's record on shipping. The Howard government has systematically destroyed the Australian shipping industry, which is evident through a number of incidents that have happened over the years but is particularly evident now in the minor changes that are contained in this bill. The government has also openly encouraged the cheapest ships in the world to ply the Australian coast. These ships are able to undercut Australian vessels through paying low wages to crews, subsidies from foreign governments and the fact that they sit outside Australian law. Many of these ships operate in Australia with poor maintenance, low wages, substandard conditions for crews and no regard for environmental or other standards.</para><para>In the pursuit of cheap shipping rates, the Howard government pays no regard to Australian jobs, the welfare of seafarers, the safety of others navigating Australian waters or the protection of our precious coastal environment. In many cases these ships are manned by crews from countries included in the Prime Minister's `arc of instability' and they are permitted to carry dangerous goods, like fertiliser, around the coast—often at the expense of the Australian industry.</para><para>By running down the Australian shipping industry, the Howard government has eroded our fourth line of defence. The Howard government has ignored the sacrifice that merchant seafarers have traditionally made to keep Australia's coast safe and its sea lanes open. In terms of future investment in the shipping industry, the government's approach is to let the industry make itself more competitive. If industry does not do that, the government is happy to sit by, let the industry suffer and allow it to decline. The Howard government does not seem at all interested in investing in the shipping and maritime industry so that it can yield greater economic dividends for our nation. By contrast, Labor is committed to the maritime sector—always has been and always will be. </para><para>Debating this bill is also an opportunity for me to set out some of Labor's policies and priorities in this area. Labor recognises the national importance of an Australian shipping industry. Labor believes we should have and can have an efficient and proficient shipping industry, and Labor knows that Australia can be both a nation of shippers and a shipping nation. The Howard government does not believe in these things. All policy developed by the Howard government takes the position that Australia is a shipper only.</para><para>Shipping is a key component of our national transport network. Labor recognises the economic and strategic importance of maintaining a secure, safe and efficient domestic shipping industry. With the domestic freight task set to double in Australia over the next 20 years, the shipping industry will not be in a position to take on an increased volume of long-distance freight in Australia. There are important social amenities, road safety and national security advantages for a crew moving high-volume and dangerous goods from road to sea.</para><para>Let me highlight just one example, which I was made aware of yesterday and which shows how the shipping industry can be vital in the future development of our nation. I refer to developments in my home state of Queensland. I read from a press statement issued by the Premier of Queensland, Peter Beattie, when he turned the soil to officially start construction:</para><quote><para>Premier Beattie has signalled it is full steam ahead for Brisbane's first dedicated cruise ship terminal.</para></quote><para>The terminal will be developed by Multiplex as the centrepiece of its $370 million port-side wharf at Hamilton. Mr Beattie said:</para><quote><para>The terminal is expected to start operations early next year and be able to host ships up to 270 metres in length, including navy vessels and super yachts ...</para></quote><para>This is a significant achievement for Queensland. It shows the partnership between the Queensland government and the private sector for major infrastructure can deliver real benefits for Queensland.</para><para>The state's first purpose-built cruise terminal marks the start of a sustainable cruise shipping industry in Queensland and will provide a significant boost to our economy: about $100 million during construction and $53 million a year during operation. This highlights the commitment from the Queensland state Labor government to the shipping and maritime industry, to infrastructure development, to jobs, to growth, to productivity, to efficiency, to skills training, to boosting our economy and to contributing to the national economy—unlike what we have seen in recent years from the federal government. Queensland is getting on with the development of the nation's maritime industry. My question is: why can't the federal government also take a leadership role in this direction?</para><para>The defence and national interest contribution of the Australian shipping industry also cannot be underestimated. The wholesale abuse of the single and continuous voyage permit system under the Howard government has opened our coastline to flag of convenience shipping, something that has been much talked about. I refer quickly to a wonderful report—probably one of the best reports in the parliament—<inline font-style="italic">Ships of shame</inline> by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. This report was done in December 1992. It is an excellent example of the work that a committee can do in bringing to light not only a national issue for us but also an international issue. I want to put on the record what can be done in leadership and in dealing with difficult global issues. The global issue of shipping is a difficult one and I believe that the Australian government should take a leadership role in that field. </para><para>The contrived unavailability of Australia's ships has unfairly favoured foreign ships with cheap foreign labour working under substandard conditions. This has undermined the Australian shipping industry, brought about job losses and devastated the maritime skills base. Just as we do not support Third World wages, working conditions and standards in other transport industries, such as aviation, road and rail, nor should we accept this practice for interstate shipping. There is a great synergy between all of these transport modes and it should be accepted by government that it needs to work hand in hand with them. I think in future debates we will be seeing more discussion as to how these modes of transport interlink.</para><para>Foreign shipping engaged in the domestic trade also poses significant threats to our nation's defence security, environment and border protection. The replacement shipping companies and work forces have no allegiance to Australia, pay no taxes here and are effectively guest labour in the Australian transport sector. Labor recognises the importance of a strong and viable domestic shipping industry using Australian crews working under Australian conditions on Australian ships. Labor also reaffirms its support for the cabotage provisions of the Navigation Act.</para><para>The Howard government does not recognise the importance of an Australian presence in the international shipping trade. Without any participation in the international trade, Australian primary producers and exporters are at the mercy of international conference lines. During the second half of 2003, conference lines more than doubled their freight rates. These lines are operating to suit their own commercial imperatives, not Australia's trading needs. The Howard government has also allowed bilateral trade deals to be signed off without any attempt to negotiate an Australian shipping component.</para><para>The Australian shipping industry is also facing a skills shortage as young people are not encouraged to seek employment and training in the industry. On that point, it has become very topical in recent months for government only to talk about the shortage of skills in the traditional trades areas such as electrical, plumbing, carpentry and building. It is just starting to wake up to the fact that there are skills shortages in the transport industry—road, particularly trucking, and rail—and it should be aware that there are also massive skills shortages in the shipping industry. This should form part of any government considerations in trying to turn this crisis around. This skills shortage has been brought about by the taxation system that disadvantages our international seafarers when compared with other Australian residents working overseas. Australian seafarers working in international trade bring back important skills that are vital to the safe and efficient operation of Australian ports and maritime industries. The Howard government has no plan to address the skills crisis, including the shortage in the shipping industry, and the infrastructure bottlenecks that are acting as a brake on Australia's future growth and prosperity.</para><para>Infrastructure bottlenecks, efficiency bottlenecks and problems with our economy have been very topical and have been the subject of Reserve Bank of Australia reports, OECD reports and government department reports. While the Australian economy enjoys the good economic times with unheralded income streams of revenue through tax and GST to the government and a range of results such as low unemployment and low interest rates—even though interest rates in Australia are the highest in the world—the government just does not seem to make the right choices in trying to give all Australians the benefit of these economic good times. The Howard government has created an economy that is driven by unsustainable debt fuelled consumption, not by exports and sustained productivity growth. That should be of huge concern to all members of parliament. I know that is of huge concern to the many economists and people in the community. </para><para>The Howard government has squandered a once in a generation opportunity to make lasting changes that could take Australia's prosperity to the next level. The great opportunities that we have today should not be squandered or missed. While the previous 20 years were about economic reform instigated by the Hawke and Keating Labor governments, the next 20 years should be about infrastructure reform and efficiency and productivity gains. That is the great challenge, but not one that we are seeing being addressed by this government.</para><para>The Howard government has wound back incentives to and support for the Australian shipping industry. As a result, investment in this sector has flagged, training and development has stagnated and support services such as salvage have been threatened—all of this at a time when the world shipping trade is growing exponentially. Labor is committed to encouraging long-term investment to rebuild the Australian maritime industries, protect our vast coastline and the maritime environment and re-establish our defence self-sufficiency. The Howard government is not moving in that same direction. Labor is committed to investigating taxation regimes that could support the expansion of the Australian shipping industry. Again, the Howard government is not looking at these regimes.</para><para>The unique nature of the shipping trade whereby seafarers often live and work on vessels for months at a time makes this industry unique. It means the national government must take responsibility for ensuring the welfare of these people is not compromised. In the pursuit of efficient, safe and secure maritime trades, it is important to build in safeguards to protect the people working in and around these industries. Labor will always ensure that the pursuit of shipping efficiencies and maritime security outcomes does not impact on the safety or welfare of seafarers and that legitimate access by welfare and labour organisations is not restricted.</para><para>At the last federal election Labor took to the Australian people a proposal that a federal Labor government would strengthen the defence of Australia with a $300 million maritime security strategy. Labor believes this is essential for our nation. Terrorist groups are operating in our region and are rapidly expanding their capacity to undertake maritime operations. Labor's maritime security strategy will ensure Australia is ready to meet this emerging threat. That maritime security strategy will involve a number of things which are well known: the establishment of an Australian coastguard, the creation of an armed sea marshals program, the deployment of more Australian Federal Police in the region and the installation of a new vessel tracking system in Darwin Harbour. A new Australian coastguard would include three new armed 55-metre-class deep ocean vessels with helicopter landing platforms and rapid intervention boats, five new armed 35-metre-class patrol vessels with rapid intervention boats and three new twin-engine helicopters.</para><para>The Australian coastguard should combine existing civilian coastal surveillance agencies in a unified chain of command. It should be integrated with the Australian Federal Police, drawing on the AFP's world-class crime fighting and counter-terrorism capabilities. But what do we get from the Howard government in terms of this act, which is quite a substantial piece of work? We get eight minor changes. With all that is before us in terms of the challenges that we have, and with all that could be done in this great time of economic prosperity, eight minor changes to a substantial act in terms of Australia's future is all we get. It is highly disappointing. </para><para>The stability and sustainability of the Australian shipping industry is fundamental to our maritime transport security and our nation's desire to protect itself against the threat of terrorism. The Howard government's policy of destroying the Australian shipping industry through the systematic abuse of the cabotage provisions of the Navigation Act has opened Australia's coastline up to increased security risks. I do not think there is actually any debate on this increased security risk. We see it discussed and debated in this place by members and talk of new security measures to try to deal with it here, so it is not as if I am speaking about something which is foreign to this place. It is something that is of grave concern and something that really should have been part of amendments and changes in this place. But as yet nothing is coming from the government.</para><para>Labor recognises that ammonium nitrate and other fertilisers are potential weapons for terrorists. Labor also recognises the security risk that the Howard government has exposed Australia to by the deregulation of the transport of fertilisers around our coastline. The fertiliser trade on the Australian coast was previously conducted using Australian ships manned by Australian seafarers. Labor maintains that, while the practice of cheap foreign shipping is allowed to continue unchecked on our coastline, any real attempts to secure our ports and facilities are compromised. The shipping and waterfront policies of Australia's national government must be complementary to the security of our nation and not diametrically opposed, as is now the case. While the government ramps itself up as the government of security, we do not see that reflected in legislation and we do not see that reflected in real, progressive changes that could be made to make Australia a safer place.</para><para>The Navigation Act will be altered in only a few minor ways. As I said earlier, there are eight amendments in total. The explanatory memorandum summaries the amendments to the act. The amendments are to:</para><para>	remove the requirement for assessors of nautical experience to advise the Court in a prosecution for a breach of regulations relating to the prevention of collisions and the display on ships of lights and signals; ...</para><para>Given Part IX was repealed in 1990, there is no mechanism for the appointment of nautical assessors and subsections 258(5) and (6) will be repealed. The bill clarifies:</para><quote><para>... that a breach of regulations relating to the prevention of collisions and the display on ships of lights and signals may be prosecuted on indictment ...</para></quote><para>In a Victorian County Court ruling in November 2003, the judge found there was a `contrary intention', so offences against the regulations should be prosecuted summarily. New section 258(3) is being inserted in response to that ruling in the Victorian County Court and therefore removes any ambiguity. The bill also revises:</para><quote><para>... penalties in the Navigation Act which relate to careless navigation near ice and the rendering of assistance following an accident at sea or where persons are in distress at sea.</para></quote><para>When we talk about navigation near ice, it makes me think that maybe the opposition in Western Australia could make use of this: instead of digging a canal, they could drag an iceberg closer to the shore of Western Australia, as has been talked about on some occasions in the past. But these amendments will ensure that penalties are more relevant and serve as a greater deterrent to breaches of the act. </para><para>In conclusion, Labor believes there needs to be greater work done to redress the legislative and administrative constraints on Australian shipping. Labor also believes greater work needs to be done to work with the industry to identify mechanisms to encourage increased investment in the Australian shipping industry. Labor supports these amendments but condemns the Howard government's abysmal record in sustaining a prosperous and productive shipping and maritime industry in Australia.</para><para>While I have the opportunity, I want to take note of some comments on the Australian industry made by the member for Melbourne Ports, Mr Michael Danby, during statements by members on 28 March 2001. I also mention that it was his 50th birthday yesterday. I wish him happy birthday and would like to have it recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. In that statement, Mr Danby said:</para><quote><para>In a recent publication on the Australian shipping industry, the managing director of ASP Ship Management Pty Ltd made a comment which I think is very interesting—that the current Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services—</para></quote><para>that is, John Anderson—</para><quote><para>said that Australia is a `nation of shippers'. He is correct. The shipping industry is a source of a great deal of our nation's wealth. But the managing director of this major Australian shipping company went on:</para><para>What is missing however, is any interest from our Commonwealth government in allowing fellow-Australians to provide shipping solutions to the shippers.</para><para>He said that, seemingly, the sole focus of attention in this current government has been on `the maritime unions and an accompanying hell-bent objective of doing nothing to support the local shipping industry'.</para></quote><para>No truer words were said in 2001 than can be said today in terms of the government's pursuit of industry. It does it purely on ideological grounds; it is more interested in dealing with unions than it is in dealing with the industry. Often we see industries and unions busily working together, ensuring there is a future for their industries, ensuring the conditions are right and ensuring that there is prosperity for the country, while the government expends its energy and resources in trying just to deal with its own ideological bents. I wanted to comment on those words by the member for Melbourne Ports. He has a longstanding commitment not only to the Australian maritime shipping industry but also to his constituents.</para><para>I will conclude by saying that there are great opportunities for the government in these good economic times. They should not be squandered; they should be seized. As we heard yesterday from the member for Grayndler, carpe diem: seize the day, take the opportunities that are before you. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do some good in a whole range of areas. I think one of those areas is the transport industry and, in this case, the maritime industry. I think that the government is squandering opportunities and should be condemned for it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>19</page.no><name role="metadata">Fawcett, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FAWCETT</name><name.id>DYU</name.id><electorate>Wakefield</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As the member for Oxley has pointed out, the <inline ref="R2235">Navigation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> corrects deficiencies in the act identified by the Victorian County Court and provides clarification through revisions to penalties for careless navigation near ice and the rendering of assistance where people are in distress at sea. Unless you are one of those people in distress at sea who the outcome of this amendment will help, it may not seem to be a particularly significant bill to be speaking in support of. </para></talk.start><para>In my career as a professional pilot, I was constantly aware that without the technician, the refueler, the runway sweeper and strict attention to the smallest of details, the flight would not be possible or it could end in a less than desirable manner. I rise to support this bill not because it in itself is a significant or controversial bill but because it typifies the attention to detail that has enabled spectacular growth and strength in the Australian economy.</para><para>In critical areas such as education, health and infrastructure spending, the Howard government have been able to invest in this country and its people because we have a strong economy—an economy that did not come about by chance and that requires ongoing leadership. This leadership ensures that not only the obvious factors affecting the economy are considered but also the underlying infrastructure, procedures and legislation are in order. In the case of our maritime legislation, this provides certainty to our exporters and shipping operators about the environment in which they will contract and operate.</para><para>As the member for Oxley noted, Australia' economy is based on export industries, and we need shipping lines to be confident in continuing to provide services to Australia. In 2001-02 there were over 21,000 ship movements into and out of Australian ports. In the same period, 506 million tonnes were exported; 58 million tonnes were imported—a total of $184 billion through our ports. In 2003, while $68 billion worth of freight was shifted by air, $188 billion<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>was shifted by sea.</para><para>As the member for Oxley pointed out, infrastructure is an important issue. It is disappointing to hear members opposite saying that the day is lost and not acknowledging some of the programs that the Howard government has been putting in place—long overdue programs—to get increased efficiency in our structures. Linkages to the ports to enable these key exports have been a feature of this government's AusLink program as well as initiatives which have seen the Australian Rail Track Corporation for the first time bring about reforms that have allowed the efficient movement of freight on Australia's rail system. These initiatives have already won the praise of industry, and in just four months they have seen real increases of up to 20 per cent in capacity on some existing lines, simply through better management.</para><para>It is disappointing to see members opposite talking about infrastructure while not identifying that the main bottleneck to capacity of the ports is the responsibility of the state Labor governments. They need to step up to the mark, to seize the day, and create the opportunity for their high-income streams to support this vital part of our economy. In my electorate of Wakefield, many people are dependent upon export. Programs such as AusLink are very visible with better infrastructure such as the new northern approach to Adelaide. This will improve access to Port Adelaide as well as reducing traffic along Main North Road. Likewise, Australian government funding for road infrastructure, such as Wyatt Road and West Avenue, linking the industrial precinct which spans the cities of Salisbury and Playford, will provide better access for industry to the port as well as reducing traffic on urban roads. This not only boosts job opportunities as industry grows but improves the safety and the quality of life for the residents of these communities.</para><para>Amendments such as the Navigation Amendment Bill 2004 serve to highlight the far less public but equally important work of the Howard government to maintain the underlying infrastructure that supports the export opportunities in Wakefield. These opportunities cross industries, including wine, grains, sheep, hay and manufacturing. For example, General Motors Holden manufacture vehicles and components in Wakefield that are exported to countries around the world. Customers in South and North America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East drive the demand that allows GMH to employ nearly 9,000 people and to export over $900 million worth of products and services. </para><para>To export nearly 32,000 vehicles in a calendar year, GMH not only needs certainty for shipping operators to service our ports but also requires a range of second-tier suppliers. Companies in the Elizabeth West industrial precinct such as Priority Engineering not only supply to GMH but have become centres of excellence in themselves for innovation and robotics. Other providers such as Hirotech, from Japan, have chosen to establish facilities in Wakefield to capitalise on the demand for components generated by GMH. Collectively, this leads to more jobs and more skills for our work force.</para><para>In the rural sector, a good example of a Wakefield exporter who will benefit from certainty in the shipping environment is the oaten hay exporter, Balco. Balco was started with Australian government R&amp;D. It enabled Balco to develop a cost-effective system for processing hay for export markets. The company uses greater compression to enable more bales to be packed in each container. Each year, Balco ships about 3,000 container loads of hay overseas to Japan, Taiwan and Korea. That is about 36 per cent of South Australia's hay exports and 18 per cent of the national hay exports. Balco's new plant at Bowmans has a processing capacity of 42,000 tonnes per year. The showcase operation was described by a visiting Taiwanese delegation as `the most modern they had seen in the world'.</para><para>Developing as an integral part of a rural community, Balco places a strong emphasis on loyalty to its local industry, community, growers and suppliers. This is a two-way situation, with the growers also committed to producing more than 86,000 tonnes from the 2004 harvest. This has enabled Balco to increase its work force from fewer than 30 in 1998 to more than 70 at this time. This is yet another group of people who have benefited from the Howard government's ability to create opportunity for individuals and companies.</para><para>The member for Oxley asked why shipping costs are important. When I visited Balco just last week they highlighted that one of the reasons for their success and their market penetration was the fact that they were able to develop better technologies to increase the amount of freight they packed in each container. When you are talking about very competitive markets with low market loyalty and very small margins, shipping costs become a considerable factor in terms of the competitiveness of your product. Were those costs to rise, Balco, their 70 staff and the farmers who rely on that export industry would suffer. The Howard government, through ensuring that there is certainty for shippers, through having infrastructure and through providing opportunities for start-ups and innovation for business, provides not just a chance for businesses to start and grow but a real opportunity, underpinned by a soundly managed legislative environment. On behalf of the exporters of Wakefield, I am pleased to support these amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>22</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2235">Navigation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> provides for a series of technical amendments. The objective of the bill is to improve the key piece of legislation regulating the Australian shipping industry—that is, the Navigation Act 1912. The opposition has given its support to the provisions included in this bill. If anything, it builds on previous work undertaken by the parliament. I would therefore like to touch on the importance of the legislation. </para></talk.start><para>The Navigation Act, in terms of the Australian national interest, is exceptionally important. I therefore think it is important that this morning the opposition touches on the Howard government's abuse of this act to undermine a very important Australian industry. The opposition, as does the Australian community, very much values the importance of the Australian shipping industry. However, unlike the Howard government, whose transport minister is also the Deputy Prime Minister—which claims that Australia is a nation of shippers, not a shipping nation—the opposition contends that, as an island country with a vast coastline and dispersed population, it is essential that Australia has a safe, secure and viable shipping industry. That is the crux of the debate in terms of how I will be approaching it.</para><para>The opposition took a very strong shipping policy to the last election. That policy was based on the recognition that we as an island nation are dependent on sea transport. The policy recognised that shipping is an essential element of the transport system, not an afterthought as is the approach of the Howard government. Our policy was based on the recognition that maritime security must be about more than simply regulating Australian ports, port workers, ships and seafarers. I contend that the government's abuse of the cabotage system under the Navigation Act is designed to do one thing and one thing alone. The objective of the Howard government is to destroy the Australian shipping industry, simply because of its illogical approach to government—namely, its hatred of the Maritime Union of Australia and its predecessor, the Seamen's Union, whom the government regards as class enemy. It is this approach to life which gets in the way of good policy and, in turn, undermines the national interest. I therefore believe that this policy is killing off of an industry by stealth and putting Australia's national interest—our safety and security, our pristine coastline and our environment—at serious risk.</para><para>I ask the House to consider a few facts in relation to the Australian shipping industry and the very blatant abuse of the single and continuous permit system under the Howard government. I must say I agree with the use of single and continuous voyage permits, but the intent of their original development was to meet short-term circumstances where we could not make Australian vessels available.</para><para>The Australian government has congratulated itself on its adoption of the International Ship and Port Facility Code. It has also sought to implement that code under the Maritime Transport Security Act. The opposition, as the records of the House will show, supported this legislation in full, consulting with the department and the minister's office to guarantee a bipartisan approach to securing our coastline. However, the government's approach to security is to apply costs and burdens—and we should not forget this in terms of the importance of exports—to Australian ports and ships, imposing the additional costs on state and territory governments while at the same time seeking to push down transport costs through the use of cheap foreign shipping.</para><para>In many cases—and this is important to the current debate about terrorism—these ships, which if anything are given preference by the Howard government, are manned by crews from countries identified in the Prime Minister's `arc of instability'. Such ships are permitted to carry dangerous goods, like fertiliser, around the coast, often at the expense of Australian ships that are more secure in terms of the terrorism threat. At Senate estimates hearings this week, government representatives revealed that 414 single-voyage permits and 95 continuous-voyage permits were issued between 1 July 2004—interestingly, the date that the maritime security legislation came into force—and 9 February this year. Compare this with the total number of 50 permits issued in 1990 when Labor was in government. </para><para>I also suggest to the House that these permits are in most instances issued to flag of convenience ships, which seriously worries the opposition. These ships are flagged in tax havens such as Panama and Liberia. They are often subsidised by foreign governments—so much for an even playing field in terms of competition policy. More importantly, it is not just about tax evasion; these ships often do not meet the same safety, environmental or labour conditions as those required of our own Australian fleet. Further, foreign ships and crews are not covered under Australia's maritime security legislation other than through rudimentary checking of crew lists against international databases and, in some instances, ship inspections at ports.</para><para>It is also interesting to note, as the House record will show, that those changes were only made as a result of a campaign pursued by the opposition trying to put pressure on the government to bring in proper visa arrangements and checking processes with respect to crews of foreign flag vessels. Rather than Australian maritime security legislation, the legislation that applies is, interestingly, that of the flag state.</para><para>The most important issue not being addressed is the carriage of high consequence dangerous goods. And I stress this: it is an issue that must be attended to as a matter of urgency by the Howard government. It is about carriage of high consequence dangerous goods, notably ammonium nitrate. I think it is well known to the Australian community—and it should be to the Howard government—that terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda and its affiliates, have used ammonium nitrate as part of their deadly campaigns. If you have any doubt about that, I simply say to the Australian community: cast your mind back to the 1993 World Trade Centre bombing, the Oklahoma bombing in 1995 and attacks on embassies in the 1990s. Ammonium nitrate is often the source of attacks doing the maximum damage by terrorist organisations throughout the world. Yet we have got foreign flag vessels plying the Australian coastline without proper checking of the crews. Often engaged in tax evasion and serious issues relating to environmental concerns, they are carrying ammonium nitrate around the Australian coastline.</para><para>This week's estimates hearings also revealed that the government has made no attempt—and I stress this—to restrict the carriage of these cargoes, despite all of its empty security rhetoric on these issues. On the contrary, since 1 July 2004 five single-voyage permits have been issued for the carriage of ammonium nitrate between Australian ports. That means that 10,800 tonnes of this highly dangerous fertiliser—not an insignificant amount—were carried under these five permits. The Howard government owes the Australian community an explanation about this during the course of this debate.</para><para>Let us put that into context. I refer to in incident that occurred involving an ammonium nitrate vessel in April 1947 in Texas City. This incident involved a ship, the <inline font-style="italic">Grandcamp</inline>, which caught alight while loading 2,300 tonnes of ammonium nitrate. As a result the ship exploded, an explosion reported to have been heard 150 miles away. Worse still, 600 people lost their lives and more than 2,000 were injured. Bear in mind that at that time Texas City had a population of around 16,000 people, 2,000 of whom were injured and 600 killed. </para><para>Just imagine the consequences of such an incident at an Australian port, perhaps Sydney Harbour or the port of Melbourne. Imagine if a foreign ship operating under a licence were to fall into the hands of a terrorist group and the cargo of the ship was ammonium nitrate. Just imagine it was in the port of Brisbane, Fremantle, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Launceston or Darwin. Just imagine the damage. Imagine the consequences of such an incident in the loss of Australian lives and the potential injury to the Australian community. Imagine the damage it could do not just to human beings but also to the social and economic fabric of the port.</para><para>The opposition therefore contend that the carriage of dangerous goods such as ammonium nitrate by foreign ships must cease now. We regard it as part of Australia's fight against terrorism to guarantee that Australian shipping is given a fair go and to also take out of the hands of foreign flag vessels the potential risk to the safety and wellbeing of the Australian community. I therefore believe that the safest way to transport ammonium nitrate and other fertilisers around Australia is on Australian ships with Australian crews.</para><para>In terms of the training of Australian seafarers, we have a college of excellence in Tasmania that was originally developed to give young Australians the opportunity to train and be gainfully employed in the seafaring industry. That Maritime Training College is unfortunately more devoted now to export earnings through the training of overseas seafarers rather than the training of Australians to take up employment in the Australian shipping industry. I suggest to the House that, because of this government's lack of initiatives, nothing has been done to encourage the development of new ships for the Australian coastal shipping industry and international shipping. Our fleet is ageing and there is an urgent requirement for the government to turn its attention to assisting and renewing the shipping industry.</para><para>This takes me to the issue of the importance of a secure ship. When a secure ship with a secure crew sails out of one secure port and into another the exposure to any risk is minimal, I believe. An Australian ship crewed by Australians is secure because they are vitally concerned with Australia's national interest. That is important because, as we all appreciate, Australia is an island nation heavily dependent on imports and exports. As we all understand, we are experiencing an exponential growth in the domestic freight task. We are more than ever dependent on shipping as a key element of the transport logistics chain in the same way that we have to pay proper attention to a national highway network and the need to upgrade our rail freight system.</para><para>But what have we got? We have the Howard government actively engaged in destroying the Australian shipping industry. Its policy, reaffirmed on numerous occasions by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, is to encourage the cheapest ships in the world to ply the Australian coastline. These vessels are cheaper than Australian vessels because of low crew wages, subsidies from foreign governments and the fact that Australian laws simply do not apply to them. Unfortunately these ships, on some occasions, operate with poor maintenance, low wages and substandard and, in some instances, inhumane conditions for crews and with no regard for environmental or other standards. In the pursuit of cheap shipping rates, the Howard government pays no regard to Australia's national interest. We saw this recently with reports that foreign ships are potentially damaging the Great Barrier Reef by throwing garbage into the sea. From an environmental and tourism perspective that is unacceptable to Australia. </para><para>Why would a large island nation, isolated from its major trading partners, with a growing domestic and international freight task and increasing pressure on its land transport infrastructure want to deliberately discourage investment and skills development in its maritime sector? Why would any nation so dependent on promoting itself as a leading tourism nation place at risk its pristine coastline—a key component of the tourism sector? Why would we support guest labour operating in this sector on substandard wages and conditions when we would not tolerate this in any other industry? Can you imagine Australia letting Filipino or Indonesian truck drivers or shopkeepers into Australia to take Australian jobs, being paid Third World wages or potentially putting Australians at risk? I do not think so. I do not think any political party would go to the next election with such a policy, yet when it comes to shipping policy it is actively and aggressively pursued by the Howard government. It also raises serious issues in relation to defence.</para><para>Finally, I would like to touch on a very important role for the Australian shipping industry, and that is as our fourth line of defence. The history of Australia shows how important the merchant navy was to defending Australia. It was exceptionally important. That is why we have an international maritime day each year to acknowledge the contribution made by the merchant navy. There is no doubt that, by running down the Australian shipping industry, the Howard government has also eroded our fourth line of defence. It has not just put Australia at risk of potential terrorist attacks with respect to the movement of ammonium nitrate; it has also deliberately eroded the fourth line of defence. The government has ignored the sacrifice merchant seafarers have traditionally made to keep Australia's coast safe and our sea lanes open.</para><para>We should not forget that in World War II more than 30,000 Allied merchant seafarers were killed and more than 4,600 were recorded missing. We not only owe it to those fallen seafarers to ensure that our shipping industry has a future, but we also need to ensure that we have a merchant fleet capable of contributing to the defence of Australia, should the need ever arise. It should also be remembered that, in recent times, Australian seafarers supported the INTERFET force deployment in East Timor. In recognition of the role of Australian seafarers, General Peter Cosgrove wrote to the Maritime Union of Australia in October 1999 acknowledging the vital role played by Australian civilian ships in supporting the Australian military contingent.</para><para>In closing, I remind the government that Australia can be a nation of shippers and a shipping nation. It is all about leadership and a willingness to give it a go. The opposition believes that in the national interest, to introduce certainty and encouragement, investment is required in the Australian shipping industry. I therefore call on the minister for transport and Deputy Prime Minister to cease the practice of abusing the cabotage provisions of the Navigation Act. These provisions were designed as a fallback to ensure availability of service, not to destroy a vital industry simply on the basis that it is unionised. It is time the Howard government listened and recognised the security, national interest and defence benefits that come from a viable shipping industry. Flag of convenience shipping is cheap, un-Australian and unacceptable in terms of our need to protect our coastline, for employment and defence, and also our need to stand up in the international fight against terrorism. There is no way foreign ships should be carrying ammonium nitrate around the Australian coast. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>26</page.no><name role="metadata">McArthur, Stewart, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McARTHUR</name><name.id>VH4</name.id><electorate>Corangamite</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The debate relating to the <inline ref="R2235">Navigation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> has been wide ranging. I appreciate the comments of those opposite, particularly the member for Batman, who covered a range of issues without any real solutions to the matter of cabotage. I will be asking the farmers how they will get their nitrate. The member for Batman also covered the permit argument and of course referred to the MUA. On any assessment, the changes at the waterfront have been hugely successful, and the ports and waterfront work so much better since those changes that took place in 1998.</para></talk.start><para>For the record, the Navigation Amendment Bill amends the Navigation Act 1912 relating to the safety of ships at sea, and I will refer to those matters in the rest of my speech in this second reading debate. The legislative steps require assessors of nautical experience to advise the court on a breach of regulations relating to the prevention of collisions and the display on ships of light and signals. Fundamentally this bill is trying to bring about a safer sea and to prevent collisions, which happen from time to time. The bill revises the penalties, particularly near ice. Each person in charge of a ship involved in a collision is required to give necessary help and assistance, stay by the ship until help arrives and give information about the ship to the person in charge of the other ship. So it is a good neighbour attitude and reinforces the thrust of the previous Navigation Act, which was changed by the unreported Victorian court ruling in November 2003.</para><para>That is the technical bill before the parliament and, like other speakers, I wish to refer to some broader issues. I was delighted that the member for Oxley referred to the `ships of shame'. I am pleased that the member for Wakefield was talking about maritime matters; that might be the first time the member for Wakefield has spoken about maritime matters for some 20 years or so. I am going to refer to a number of reports that have come out over the years: <inline font-style="italic">Ships of shame: inquiry into ship safety</inline>; <inline font-style="italic">Ships of shame</inline><inline font-style="italic">—A sequel: inquiry into ship safety</inline>; <inline font-style="italic">Ship safe</inline>;<inline font-style="italic"></inline>and another report called <inline font-style="italic">Beyond the midnight oil</inline>. Over the years, I have been involved in these reports and discussions about the safety of ships, crews, maritime matters and, as the member for Batman in his wide-ranging speech alluded to, matters of cabotage, flags of convenience ships and all those matters that impose upon Australian shipping.</para><para>Let me say from the outset that I accept the proposition that Australia is an island and depends very much upon shipping to move exports to other nations around the world and bring imports in. So the shipping lanes, the availability of ships and the availability of good port facilities is critical for the welfare of all Australians as are key those areas of transport that move the goods from the ports to areas of population. The ships of shame inquiry in 1992 was chaired by the Hon. Peter Morris, and Minister Vaile, who I see at the table, participated in the second inquiry of the ships of shame—he may even have been the chairman at one stage, following on the outstanding work of Peter Morris. I wish to put on the record that the ships of shame and subsequent inquiries have had an influence internationally. The attitudes of Australian governments and those reports have had an impact internationally in trying to bring about a sense of balance in matters of crewing, flags of convenience, quality shipping and safety.</para><para>The member for Batman raised matters of ship safety in his wide-ranging speech. <inline font-style="italic">Ship safe</inline> was a report about ship safety that identified some of the risk factors in shipping. It said: </para><quote><para>The underlying (and interacting factors) which undermine ship safety are:</para><para>Owners, operators and charterers faced commercial pressures due to low freight rates and the strong supply of shipping relative to demand. Responsibly operated ships continue to be required to compete with substandard ships. Classifications societies, insurers and flag states also continue to be subject to market forces, raising the danger of standards being compromised in the pursuit of market position.</para></quote><para>The member for Batman I think quite fairly alluded to those problems of competition, of substandard ships—particularly the bulk ore carriers—and pressure in international freight rates that undermine the safety of ships and crews. The next point the Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform noted in the report was:</para><quote><para>The increasing globalisation of the shipping industry and the scattering of responsibility centres continue to make it difficult to supervise and enforce uniform practices and standards in such areas as shipbuilding, operations and language. For example, AMSA asserted that:</para><para>...we have hundreds of shipyards building ships nominally under the one standard, but under a myriad of interpretations.</para></quote><para>So the committee over the years have seen this assessment of ship standards, ageing ships, the insurance of different types of vessels and the inability of one nation or another, be it Australia, a European country or the USA, to make one standard of ship that is safe. The committee report went on to say:</para><quote><para>Inadequate accountability mechanisms mean that the beneficial owner of the ship is not always required to face the consequences of breaches of ship safety.</para></quote><para>As most members would be aware, that is the flags of convenience, where the ship owner, the operator of the ship and the crew could all be in different jurisdictions. The final comment was that not all participants in the industry demonstrate respect for human life. That was the thrust of both <inline font-style="italic">Ship safe </inline>and <inline font-style="italic">Ships of shame</inline>, that international shippers showed no regard for those crews from Third World countries and were prepared to let the older rust buckets, as they were referred to, slip to the bottom of the ocean with great loss of life—particularly those ore carriers to Western Australia, and the <inline font-style="italic">Kirke</inline>, which has been referred to in some of those reports. They were certainly very questionable craft, but one or two voyages could make considerable sums of money for the owners, wherever they might be.</para><para>Other speakers have referred to international safety. The difficulty is: how do you implement a code? How do you enforce it on those recalcitrant shipowners and operators who flagrantly ignore sensible safety arrangements? There has been an International Safety Management Code which was mandated by the SOLAS convention and became binding on 128 countries, which account for more than 97 per cent of world merchant shipping tonnage. So there has been an attempt by those more responsible seafaring nations to join a code. It came into force on 1 July 1998 for passenger ships, high-speed craft, oil, chemical and gas carriers, bulk carriers and high-speed cargo craft. It was implemented in July 2002 for other cargo ships over 500 tonnes and mobile offshore drilling units. So we can see, amongst all the argument, that an attempt has been initiated by Australian governments—on both sides, I might say—to bring about a better system of international rule in an area which is fraught with difficulty.</para><para>Regarding ship safety, another report called <inline font-style="italic">Beyond</inline><inline font-style="italic"> the midnight oil</inline> talked about fatigue. In <inline font-style="italic">Ships of Shame</inline> and the follow-up to it, we talked a lot about the fatigue of crews, pilots and captains as a possible cause of collisions at sea. I have always been particularly interested in the <inline font-style="italic">Exxon Valdez</inline> incident in 1989, which was brought about by ongoing fatigue. I would like to quote from what Professor Dinges told a parliamentary committee. He said: </para><quote><para>... the demanned vessel meant there were fewer crew on board to do the work. On the high seas, that worked out well, but when you pulled into the <inline font-style="italic">Valdez</inline> port and had to load out and were under terrific time pressure, it meant that the first officer was awake 36 hours, could not go any more and finally went to bed. It meant that the second officer had been awake too long, well past the hours of service. He went to bed. And it meant that the man at the helm at the critical time as they left that port through Prince William Sound was a third officer, with limited experience.</para></quote><para>We all know what happened: the <inline font-style="italic">Valdez</inline> had a horrific accident and the spillage was horrendous. That was brought about by fatigue, a factor of crew management.</para><para>The whole issue of shipping around the Australian coastline—the cabotage argument, the permit argument—is one we could probably debate forever, but, in terms of the bill before the House, I would like to refer to the international position. The Hon. Peter Morris, who is chairman of the International Commission on Shipping, brought out a report in March 2001 called <inline font-style="italic">Ships, Slaves and Competition</inline>—a follow-up to the <inline font-style="italic">Ships of Shame</inline> report that was before this House—which made a number of recommendations. It looked at the international problem faced by shippers, crews, shipowners, classification societies and those who want to bring about a better set of international shipping arrangements. Peter Morris is now a figure of international reputation in the area of ship safety, crewing and improving the general standard of international shipping. Australia can be proud of Peter Morris's contribution and of this parliament's contribution to this whole debate, which seemed up until that time to be insolvable. Because of the difficulties of having flag state ships with foreign crews from Third World countries, who were being paid low wages and working in substandard conditions, it was felt that nobody could do anything about it—until we did something here in Australia.</para><para>The report recommends that crewing be looked at fairly carefully. Seafarers who have been trained in the Philippines or in other areas of repute and who have fraudulent certificates are an ongoing difficulty. Then there are the employment practices which all members have alluded to. The difficulties on some of these substandard ships with regard to the number of crew, their conditions, their food, hours of work and all those things have almost been impossible to police, but I think progress is being made. There are problems with inspecting ships to ensure they meet quality standards. There are problems associated with Lloyds's insurance assessment and inspection of oil carriers and chemical distribution ships. There are problems with non-payment and abandonment of crews—they are not paid and they are just left out in the cold. There are recommendations that crews on cruise ships be provided with better conditions. It can be a problem to work out who actually owns the ships. As we mentioned, with flag states, the multiple ownership of ships is a problem—no-one can actually identify who has final responsibility.</para><para>Flag states continue to be a problem. Host governments are prepared to run flag ships for taxation reasons. With some of their taxation regimes being more in line with those of Western countries, internationally people are starting to put some pressure on them to have quality ships. Classification societies have had a number of difficulties in classifying ships for insurance purposes—distinguishing older ships from those of a younger age and putting genuine insurance premiums on those ships. Australia has done a particularly good job of looking after ports and identifying whether the ships that come here meet Australian standards. The member for Batman can be pleased with that part of Australia's regime. The ships that come here can be detained for anywhere between 24 hours to a week if they do not meet international standards. The International Maritime Organisation is attempting to get some sort of international agreement about the quality of ships. The International Labour Organisation—and I support this approach—is trying to look after some of the seafarers because they have had a pretty rough time. </para><para>I commend that report. I also commend the position Australia has taken in leading the way. Contrary to the comments of those opposite, there has been an attempt to improve shipping. Some of the more responsible importing and exporting companies in Australia are now using quality shipping. Because of port control, they have decided not to use second- and third-class ships—`old rustbuckets', as many members have referred to them—which have the potential to sink very quickly.</para><para>Australia has taken the lead. Internationally, we have provided some very good benchmarks of performance. Australia needs quality ships for exporting and importing, and in my assessment, over the 10 years that I have been interested in maritime matters, the movement has been in the right direction. The ships of lesser quality are not coming to Australia because of the port control. They know that if they come here and they have a defect in their steelwork, safety measures or lifeboats they will be detained for a period of days and that will affect their bottom line.</para><para>I commend the bill. I commend the general sentiment that the maritime industry is critical to Australia, and that all of us need to make sure we improve the quality of the personnel and the management. Now that we have improved the operation of the ports we can look forward to Australia's exports moving into world trade in a more expeditious manner.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>29</page.no><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LLOYD</name><name.id>IK6</name.id><electorate>Robertson</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to thank the members for Oxley, Batman, Wakefield and Corangamite for their contributions to the second reading debate on the <inline ref="R2235">Navigation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>.

Tragically, two of these collisions resulted in the death of a crew member of the fishing boat. The Navigation Amendment Bill 2004 complements an Australia wide safety awareness campaign currently being conducted by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau—the ATSB. The purpose of the campaign is to reduce the number of collisions between trading ships and commercial fishing boats by raising the awareness of commercial fishermen of the contributory factors which have been identified by the ATSB in its investigation of collisions.</para><para>As part of the campaign, members of the ATSB Marine Investigation Unit have begun a series of informal face-to-face discussions with commercial fishermen in fishing ports around Australia. The first of those meetings was held in Eden in December 2004. In December 2004 the ATSB released a safety bulletin aimed specifically at the crew of fishing boats. In addition, it published a series of informative articles in commercial fishing industry magazines and newsletters. </para><para>It is not only the crews of fishing boats who need to be aware of the possibility of collisions. The crews of trading ships also need to be aware of the possibility of a collision with a smaller vessel. Recognising this, in 2000 the ATSB published three safety bulletins on fishing boats, safety and fatigue. Those safety bulletins target the crews of ships trading on the Australian coast. In addition to the campaign, the Navigation Amendment Bill 2004 will strengthen the legislative regime which is intended to enforce requirements to comply with the internationally recognised collisions regulations, by amending the Navigation Act 1912—the principal Commonwealth act relating to safety of ships.</para><para>Two of the amendments will correct deficiencies in the Navigation Act highlighted by an unreported decision of the Victorian County Court in November 2003, by, firstly, removing the requirement for assessors of nautical experience to advise the court in a prosecution for a breach of the collisions regulation. There is no mechanism for the appointment of nautical assessors. Secondly, the bill will clarify that a breach of the collisions regulation may be prosecuted on indictment. In addition, the bill will revise some penalties, including the penalty that applies where there is a failure to render assistance to a vessel in distress. In conclusion, again I thank those members who contributed to the debate on this bill, and I would like to thank the good officials of my department who also worked to put this bill together.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>30</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr LLOYD (Robertson—Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads) (11.05 a.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BANKRUPTCY AND FAMILY LAW LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>30</page.no><id.no>S426</id.no></debateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 10 February.</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>30</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>30</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The <inline ref="S426">Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> is a part of the Howard government's continuing reform of both family law and bankruptcy law.</para><para>In particular, this bill addresses the interaction of bankruptcy law and family law, and implements key recommendations of the <inline font-style="italic">Joint </inline><inline font-style="italic">taskforce r</inline><inline font-style="italic">eport on the use of bankruptcy and family law schemes to avoid payment of</inline><inline font-style="italic"> t</inline><inline font-style="italic">ax</inline> (the task force).</para><para>The most significant amendments contained in this bill are designed to harmonise the law that applies to the division of assets upon insolvency and upon the breakdown of a marriage and, in particular, to the interaction between the Family Law Act 1975 and the Bankruptcy Act 1966. There have been longstanding concerns about the uncertainty facing both bankruptcy trustees and non-bankrupt spouses when these two areas of law operate concurrently.</para><para>This bill will make comprehensive changes, some of which affect the Bankruptcy Act 1966, but are mainly focused on powers and procedures in relation to family property and financial arrangements under the Family Law Act 1975.</para><para>Schedule 1 contains amendments designed to clarify the rights of the bankruptcy trustee and the non-bankrupt spouse, and to offer certainty as to the competing claims of creditors and the non-bankrupt spouse. </para><para>The amendments in schedule 1 will enable concurrent bankruptcy and family law proceedings to be brought together in a court exercising family law jurisdiction, to ensure that all issues are dealt with at the same time. This is achieved by giving courts exercising family law jurisdiction additional jurisdiction to deal with bankruptcy matters that are run concurrently with a family law financial matter, and by facilitating the bankruptcy trustees' and third party creditors' involvement in family law proceedings. By merging the courts' jurisdiction on bankruptcy and family law matters in cases where these areas interact, the amendments will allow the courts exercising family law jurisdiction to consider the non-financial contributions of a non-bankrupt spouse to the acquisition of family property.</para><para>Under the schedule 1 amendments, the trustee in bankruptcy can be a party to property or spousal maintenance proceedings under the Family Law Act 1975, and the court will have jurisdiction over property that has become vested bankruptcy property. The court will be able to make an order against the relevant bankruptcy trustee as part of the property adjustment order, allowing the trustee effectively to stand in the shoes of the bankrupt spouse.</para><para>The effect of these amendments will be to offer procedures and protections to the non-bankrupt spouse that were not previously available. At the same time, the court can be on notice about the interests of creditors of a bankrupt spouse and can take those interests into account in determining family property or spousal maintenance orders.</para><para>Schedule 2 to the bill will establish an enhanced regime for collecting income contributions under the Bankruptcy Act 1966. Currently, the Official Receiver can collect contributions to repay outstanding creditors from a bankrupt wage earner's salary and/or bank accounts. However, the existing provisions offer limited recovery of contributions against a self-employed bankrupt. These amendments will introduce a supervised account regime, giving the trustee access to all of the bankrupt's income before it reaches the bankrupt, ensuring that the contribution scheme applies in a more even-handed and effective manner.</para><para>Schedules 3 and 4 to the bill contain amendments that are designed to prevent people using financial agreements under part VIIIA of the Family Law Act 1975 to defeat the claims of creditors. The amendments will ensure that the existing `clawback' provisions in the Bankruptcy Act 1966 can be used to recover transfers made pursuant to financial agreements. The amendments will also create a new act of bankruptcy which will occur when a person is rendered insolvent as a result of transfers made pursuant to a financial agreement. This will allow the bankruptcy trustee access to dispositions of property made after that act of bankruptcy is committed.</para><para>Schedule 5 contains amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 that clarify the role of third parties, including creditors, in family property and spousal maintenance proceedings under that act. There are also provisions in this schedule designed to ensure that binding financial agreements made under part VIIIA of the Family Law Act 1975 are not used to defeat the claims of creditors. These provisions will require that a separation declaration be made by parties to a binding financial agreement that deals with post-separation financial arrangements, before those aspects of the agreement come into effect. </para><para>The government is committed to enhancing and making the family law and bankruptcy systems more accessible, efficient and effective, and this bill is part of the government's commitment to that goal.</para><para>Full details of the measures contained in this bill are outlined in the explanatory memorandum to the bill, which I present to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>32</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the Attorney-General for dealing with this bill, which has already been introduced in the other place. The <inline ref=" S426">Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> will make a number of changes, as the Attorney has set out, to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 and to the Family Law Act 1975. The primary object of the bill is to address issues concerning the interaction between family law and bankruptcy which have created uncertainty as to the competing rights of creditors and the non-bankrupt spouse. Labor supports these aims and these changes.</para></talk.start><para>The other objects of this bill are to provide a more effective means of collecting income contribution from bankrupts who do not receive their income as a salary or wage, and to prevent the misuse of financial agreements in relation to marriage by bankrupts as a means of avoiding payment to creditors. In particular, those who are not ordinary PAYE taxpayers have had in the past a greater propensity or capacity to make use of the inadequate interaction between family and bankruptcy laws to structure their affairs in a way that often left creditors and the Australian Taxation Office significantly out of pocket.</para><para>Whilst these provisions of the government's bill are sound to the extent that they reach, the bill still fails to address one of the key bankruptcy controversies that instigated a whole round of changes in the bankruptcy field in the first place—that is, the issue of high-income professionals using bankruptcy as a means of avoiding their taxation and other obligations, often by the manner in which they ordered their family affairs. Whilst the changes that are before us today are significant, the Labor Party is concerned that, year after year, the government has baulked on the very issue that we believe it should have been pursuing. It botched the exposure draft of an original bill by hastily preparing provisions that went way too far and caught out way too many people. It has rightly ditched those too far-reaching provisions but has not managed to replace them with anything adequate, and it leaves as a weeping sore the potential for high-income earners to continue to rort the system.</para><para>We do know that it is only a small number of people, and most of the media coverage has been focused on a number of Sydney barristers, who have ever used these loopholes. But there is no excuse from our perspective for the government failing to draft provisions which will catch these people. Even the Liberal Party in its pro-business, pro-entrepreneurial culture surely does not condone the ripping off of small business creditors, other family members or the tax office. I will come later to amendments that the Labor Party moved in the other place and which now form part of the bill as it has come to the House. These amendments do take a step in the right direction in protecting others from the acts of those high-income individuals.</para><para>An earlier exposure draft of this bill, as I have mentioned to the House, was released in October 2003 by the Attorney only a few weeks after he took on the job as Attorney-General. When its apparent weaknesses were quickly pointed out, he referred the bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for comment. The committee received 174 submissions, and its report was presented on 23 July 2004. The House of Representatives committee recommended that the amendments contained in schedule 1 of the exposure draft, relating to tainted property and tainted money, should be abandoned. These provisions, although intended to cure the evil that I have mentioned above, would have put at risk every legal and proper transaction of many small business owners and professionals over many past years. The poor drafting of these provisions simply made them too wide, and they would not have been able to be accepted in this place. </para><para>The committee recommended that the amendments to the exposure draft bill found in schedules 2, 3, 4 and 5 be implemented. The government took the committee's advice to remove the offending sections but did not take on all of the committee's other comments and suggestions about how this issue could be dealt with more properly.</para><para>This bill contains amendments designed to clarify the interaction between family law and bankruptcy, as we have said. It seeks to address concerns regarding the uncertainty facing both bankruptcy trustees and non-bankrupt spouses when family law and bankruptcy proceedings occur concurrently. Under the existing law, different outcomes can arise depending on the order in which events occur—whether separation occurs first or bankruptcy and the distribution of property—and sometimes on the order in which litigation is commenced in those different areas, which can sometimes provide incentives for deception to occur. Schedule 1 of this bill sensibly enables concurrent bankruptcy and family law proceedings to be brought together to allow all issues to be dealt with at the same time.</para><para>I note that concerns have been raised in some quarters. These concerns were outlined also in the House of Representatives committee report about jurisdictional problems in having the Family Court deal with bankruptcy matters and the fact that the Family Court does not have an established expertise in this area. However, we have been assured by the government that it believes that these issues are surmountable and are certainly outweighed by the benefits that these changes will make, but it is a matter that will need to be monitored. Of course, an increased reliance on the Federal Magistrates Court that deals with both jurisdictions should certainly help this issue.</para><para>By ensuring that bankruptcy and the division of property in a marriage breakdown can all be handled by one court together, appropriate orders can be made so that the interests of all parties to the proceedings—the bankrupt, the non-bankrupt spouse and any creditors or other third party—are equally and fairly taken into account. This is important so that the law is flexible enough to deal with the many and varied circumstances and motives of parties that may exist where bankruptcy and marital breakdown occur concurrently or closely together.</para><para>It also ensures that the technical timing of separation or bankruptcy is not a definitive factor which may disadvantage one of the parties—for example, a creditor or a non-bankrupt spouse. The provisions remove the incentive for people to use family law proceedings inappropriately as a means of protecting family assets that might otherwise be available.</para><para>Schedule 2 of the bill seeks to address the problem where some bankrupts, particularly high-income fee-for-service professionals, do not operate bank accounts in their own names. This practice renders the existing contribution collection scheme ineffective but, of course, is based on a system of garnishing a proportion of a bankrupt's income from their bank account. The proposed changes give the trustee the power in certain cases to require the bankrupt to pay all of their income into a bank account supervised by the trustee. </para><para>The proposed changes also provide for an agreement to be reached between the trustee and the bankrupt on certain matters, such as withdrawals from the account to meet the bankrupt's living expenses or additional withdrawals to meet unexpected liabilities, on the proviso that the balance of the account remains sufficient to meet the bankrupt's contribution amount.</para><para>Decisions made by the bankruptcy trustee will be reviewable first by the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy and then by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Labor supports these measures to ensure that the obligations of a bankrupt to their creditors cannot be circumvented simply by a quirk of their accounting procedures and banking choices. It is essential to the integrity of bankruptcy law that the trustee is able to monitor any bankruptcy income to ensure that all available money is returned to creditors.</para><para>Schedules 3 and 4 contain changes that also go to the interaction between family law and bankruptcy by narrowing the definition of a maintenance agreement under the Bankruptcy Act to prevent individuals from using other contractual arrangements, namely financial agreements involving marriage under part VIIIA of the Family Law Act, to defeat the claims of creditors. Of course, maintenance agreements under part VIII will not be affected, including the liability of one party to a marriage to maintain the other under section 72 of the Family Law Act.</para><para>The aim of these provisions is to ensure that a potential bankrupt does not push himself or herself into bankruptcy by the very act of transferring valuable assets to their spouse or former spouse under one of these agreements. These provisions will also introduce a new act of bankruptcy that will occur when an individual is rendered insolvent as a result of assets being transferred under a financial agreement.</para><para>The government also introduced in the other place some additional amendments to this bill. The provisions were originally included in part 19 of the Family Law Amendment Bill 2004, which was introduced into the parliament on 1 April 2004. The inquiry of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee into the original bill unanimously supported the provisions that have now been inserted into the bill that is before us today.</para><para>The government did not proceed with the passage of that bill last year and has now chosen to incorporate into the current bill those part 19 amendments which attempt to prevent concocted financial agreements or marriage breakdown being used to avoid obligation to creditors. It also includes a provision to entitle a third party to become a party to proceedings where their interests may be affected.</para><para>The provisions require parties to sign a separation declaration stating that there is no reasonable likelihood of them resuming cohabitation. It is aimed at protecting the rights of third-party creditors by preventing debtors who are otherwise in ongoing marriages from transferring assets to their spouses by way of sham transactions or sham separations designed to defeat the interests of genuine creditors.</para><para>We note that the additional amendments moved by the government in the other place also include a minor clarification to section 79F which was not included in the original form of this bill. It now incorporates a suggestion by the Law Council of Australia which was unanimously supported by the Senate committee in its report on the Family Law Amendment Bill 2004. </para><para>Certainly all of these changes might sound technical, but we would like to put on the record that the government informed the opposition of its intention to move these amendments in the other place only on the day that the amendments were to be moved. It turned out that, given the Senate's business, it was actually a day later. While we accept that these are provisions which have previously been introduced, it is unacceptable to us—and inexplicable, it seems—that the government should not be able to provide the opposition with reasonable notice of its intentions, especially when both bills have been around and have been debated and examined for such a long time.</para><para>If we, the opposition, with our meagre resources, are able to provide amendments that we intend to move to the government some months before we do so, particularly as was the case in this area, you would think that the government could also find a way to assist the opposition by giving us sufficient notice for dealing with these matters. To us, it is just another indication of the government's complete mismanagement of this entire issue and its inability to develop a comprehensive strategy to address the relationship between family law and bankruptcy and the related anti-avoidance problem. To date, all that it has presented to parliament is a piecemeal strategy, and the way these last-minute amendments have been tacked on is just another demonstration of this.</para><para>Despite this, of course, Labor are not going to be churlish and will support the new amendments as part of this bill, given that they do have merit to them. In addition, Labor's amendment on the rebuttal of presumption of insolvency, which was moved in the Senate last week, now stands part of this bill as it was passed and we are debating it today. We believe that this amendment makes this bill a better piece of legislation.</para><para>Labor have taken account of the history of this issue, and under our initiative the Senate passed an amendment which includes a presumption against the bankrupt when they have an outstanding tax debt or where they have made a transfer of property but failed to keep adequate records. It is simply unacceptable to us—and I am pleased that the member for Lowe is here because it is something that he has pursued vigorously for many years—that high-flyers can fund an extravagant, profligate lifestyle, be able to avoid their obligations to the Taxation Office and to creditors and be living at the expense of the rest of us.</para><para>Our amendment was one of the methods that were discussed by the House of Representatives committee last year to deal with this issue. We understand that it will not fix all of the problems that have been identified, but it does go some of the way and it is an improvement on what the government has achieved so far. If the opposition, with our meagre resources, can put this amendment forward as a serious improvement, it seems to us that if the government fails to support it then it is not truly committed to addressing this issue.</para><para>From discussions with the Attorney-General's office, I know that later an amendment will be moved here to exclude Labor's proposal in this area, which I think is extremely disappointing. The government, when this amendment was due to be debated in the Senate last week, announced that it was going to put out yet another discussion paper and it wants to deal again with this issue and get more feedback. It says that it would like to deal with it comprehensively, and therefore will not support an amendment which may go only part of the way to improving the situation. But it seems to me that no-one has been able to provide a decent reason why our amendment would cause any damage. Even the Attorney-General, in question time last week, indicated that it will go part of the way to fixing the problem that we are all aware of. Given that the rest of the government's strategy in dealing with bankruptcy and family law matters is piecemeal, we do not understand why taking this step at this point in time is proving so difficult for the government. </para><para>Our amendment, which now stands part of the bill, was moved by the Labor Party and passed by the Senate. It provides that a person who transferred assets to a third party at or below market value at a time when they were proved to be insolvent could have action taken against them in recovering those assets. It would address this problem that has been identified of high-income tax debtors abusing the present system and hiding behind the very difficult questions of proof that often face a trustee or creditor. Legitimate transfers will not be inappropriately caught, as it is a presumption which they can disprove, but it will shift the evidentiary burden onto those who have done the wrong thing and make it significantly easier for the trustee in bankruptcy to make their case.</para><para>Our changes to the bill mean that the legislation before us today will provide a rebuttable presumption of insolvency in circumstances where either (a) the bankrupt has made a transfer of property while at the same time having an outstanding tax return or (b) the bankrupt has made a transfer of property and has failed to keep adequate books, accounts and records in accordance with their obligations.</para><para>This sensible amendment, which was moved in the Senate and which stands part of the bill we are debating now, shifts the onus onto the very people whose actions are in question to ensure that their records are accurate and their obligations to the tax office are fulfilled, in the knowledge that if they fail in this regard there will be a presumption of insolvency against them. This presumption will bring the full weight of the law onto them if they have acted improperly while they were insolvent. We believe that our improvements to this bill reduce the evidentiary burden on the trustee in such a way that the bankrupt cannot rely on the absence of proper records to avoid scrutiny of particular asset transfers.</para><para>Our changes to this bill take action where the government has consistently failed to do so. I urge it to accept the form of the bill that the Senate has sent down to this place to be dealt with. We believe the bill as it stands tackles some of the operational problems that exist in recovering assets from third parties under section 120 and section 121 of the act. The real difficulties in recovering assets from third parties who have received a transfer of assets are often not the principles of law but can concern evidentiary issues—that is, showing that assets were transferred to avoid them coming under the control of the bankrupt's trustee. These may, for example, be in circumstances where their account and record keeping has long since disappeared.</para><para>Changes consistent with the amendments Labor moved in the Senate were suggested in several submissions to the House of Representatives inquiry into the poorly constituted exposure draft of the government. These changes were viewed favourably by the committee. I am advised that the government will oppose these amendments and vote against them in the House. In moving these amendments in the other place we did not pretend that our amendments offered the answer to every use and abuse of the bankruptcy system, but they do seek to tackle an issue that the government has failed to address despite extensive opportunities over what is now more than four years. You would think that the government would see this as an opportunity to improve the ability of the government to prevent high-income earners avoiding their tax and credit obligations. </para><para>I have already flagged that we understand that the government will now be undertaking yet another consultation process in an attempt to address these anti-avoidance issues that have been raised consistently for four years. But we have to put on the record that we have strong doubts about the government's bona fides in this area, given the length of time that has elapsed since it first became aware of this problem and its continued and repeated failure to grapple with it properly. Nearly four years on, we now have the government releasing a discussion paper on the issue.</para><para>Of course the Labor Party will cooperate with this discussion and consultation process and take a strong interest in the outcome of the consultations the government undertakes. These are important issues and, even if the government were to accept the improvements to our bills today, there are other issues that would still need to be dealt with. We urge the government to take them seriously and to act quickly, thoroughly and properly in this area so that changes can be made to our system which will ensure that these loopholes are comprehensively closed.</para><para>We will continue to pressure the government to address these issues; but, as I have said, we must place on the record that an appropriate and detailed response to this problem should have been developed well before now. By failing to adequately consult and develop a workable position on this matter the first time around, and then failing to address this operational problem existing in the act through simple amendments such as those that we have suggested, the government has ignored moderate and sensible changes that would either address or partially address a legitimate problem in the existing law. Labor's proposals are an important additional step that can and should be taken in making these other changes that are before the House today and are proportionate to the problems that they seek to resolve. During question time last week, the Attorney even conceded that Labor's amendments would assist. He criticised our amendments for not going far enough but said that they would `go part of the way to resolving the issues'. This seems to me a good argument for the government to be voting for the bill as it now stands before the House. It is a sensible improvement on that which was originally introduced, and I urge the government to support it. It will further strengthen the law and tighten some of the loopholes which have allowed some high-flyers to avoid their obligations to others in the community and to the tax office. We should be taking all steps to prevent that sort of avoidance at every possible opportunity. I commend the bill in the form that it now stands to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>37</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to join the debate on the <inline ref="S426">Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline>.

However, the bill before the chamber was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which I now chair but which was then chaired by my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar. I believe that there ought to be a greater use of House committees and, while the Attorney is at the table, I encourage the government to in future refer bills to the House committee rather than the Senate committee.

I thought that was a very interesting response.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This bill is part of the Howard government's ongoing reform of the family law and bankruptcy law system and follows up the recommendations of a joint task force report. This is a very difficult and complicated area of law and there has had to be, as indeed there has been, appropriate consultation with interest groups. It is important to get the law right and, as the honourable member for Gellibrand indicated in her contribution, this is an area which does require ongoing attention. The joint task force comprised officers of the Attorney-General's Department, the Australian Taxation Office, Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia and Treasury and it examined the use of bankruptcy in family law schemes to avoid the payment of tax. There has been a lot of concern about certain high-income individuals, such as barristers, not paying their obligations to the community, and in the executive summary of the report of the task force these words appear:</para><quote><para>A small but significant number of high-income tax debtors, typically high earning fee-for-service professionals, use bankruptcy to avoid paying the tax that they owe according to the law. These debtors have the ability to pay their debts, but instead fund a lifestyle made possible only through the non payment of tax and the build up of assets in the names of related parties. Typically the ATO is the sole or most significant creditor and the dividend distributed to creditors by the trustee in bankruptcy amounts to only a few cents in the dollar. The inequity of this device is compounded as some offending debtors divert income and assets to other parties in a manner designed to thwart the capacity of the trustee in bankruptcy to realise their value for the benefit of the ATO or other creditors.</para></quote><para>I do not believe that any reasonable person in our community would see this as being in any way an acceptable situation. It is, however, appropriate to look at the law very carefully because when you do make substantial changes you want to make sure that the changes do not bring in more inequities than the amendments seek to remove.</para><para>This bill removes family law loopholes for bankrupts seeking to avoid payment of debts and makes it harder for bankrupts to avoid their obligations to pay income contributions. This government is a government which likes to go out and consult with the Australian community on major law change. At times there has been comment that it takes a while for legislation to actually hit the statute books, but I believe that it is appropriate to get the legislation right or as right as you can at the time. This bill responds to public comment on the exposure draft of the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment (Anti-Avoidance and Other Measures) Amendment Bill 2004 and submissions made about that bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It is interesting to note that the committee, which at that stage had members of both political parties on it, recommended that the amendments proceed, and that is exactly what the government is doing with this particular legislation.</para><para>In keeping with our ongoing reform of bankruptcy services, this bill addresses the interaction of laws relating to bankruptcy and family law. As I said before, it implements key recommendations of the joint task force report entitled <inline font-style="italic">The use of bankruptcy and family law schemes to avoid payment of tax</inline>. The most significant amendments contained in the bill are designed to harmonise the law that applies to the division of assets upon insolvency and upon the breakdown of a marriage and, in particular, to the interaction between the Family Law Act 1975 and the Bankruptcy Act 1966. Honourable members would be aware that the government has already introduced amendments under part 19 of the <inline ref="R2031">Family Law Amendment Bill 2004</inline> to address the use of family law schemes, such as financial agreements and property orders, to avoid the payment of debts. The present bill sets up a fairly comprehensive regime of changes to the two acts I mentioned before which are designed to overcome uncertainty and hardship for the non-bankrupt spouse and/or creditors where those two areas of law interact. There are a number of schedules to the bill, each of which makes significant and positive changes. </para><para>This is important legislation. It is legislation which has been well thought out and widely discussed in the community. It has resulted from a report, and that report has in turn been investigated by a committee. So, despite what the member for Gellibrand has said, this legislation is legislation which I believe is appropriate. I believe that this legislation is good in its present form. My own view is that the amendment moved in the other place by the opposition is not necessary. However, I say that with a caveat: I do believe that bankruptcy and family law are very complicated and difficult areas where governments must react to changed circumstances and to public perceptions. I suggest that looking at bankruptcy and family law and how these interact will remain a work in progress into the future. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>39</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the <inline ref="S426">Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> in principle but also to strongly support the comments that have been made by the shadow Attorney-General, Ms Nicola Roxon.

It is simply not possible for the opposition to perform its effective role in one of the key prescribed functions of the opposition as we have here today—namely:</para></talk.start><quote><para>scrutiny of, criticism of, and suggestion of improvements to, legislation and financial proposals;</para></quote><para>As the member for Gellibrand noted, the government informed the opposition of its intention to move these amendments only on the day that the amendments were moved. This is yet another example in a long line of examples where the government has flagrantly breached its constitutional conventional obligations to afford the opposition reasonable time in which to consider motions and bills before the House. This is certainly a pretty complex area of tax law.</para><para>I raise this point in light of the shadow Attorney-General identifying key omissions in this legislation which are critical causes of this bill coming into contemplation in the first place. A key failure of this bill, as identified by my colleague, is the issue of high-income professionals using bankruptcy as a means of avoiding their taxation and other obligations, often by the manner in which they order their family affairs. I am sure you would be aware of the work I have done in this House over the last three years, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, and I will come to that towards the end of my speech. </para><para>I would like to refer members today to the table of schedules found on pages 3 and 4 of the Department of the Parliamentary Library's <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> No. 52, dated 29 November last year. The table shows how certain recommendations in the report in 2002 of the joint taskforce on the use of bankruptcy and family law schemes to avoid payment of tax are addressed in this bill. As the reader can see, these recommendations are dealt with in the various schedules of the bill.</para><para>It is timely to bring a real example of the facts this bill ought to address. A notorious example is the use of family trust arrangements as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on Saturday, 16 June 2001 in a news review article entitled `The Wife's Tale'. Members of the House will recall that this is the story of the former One.Tel director Jodee Rich and his wife Maxine Rich. I will quote inter alia:</para><quote><para>Most of the 38-year-old (Maxine) Rich's portfolio career as a lawyer, university law lecturer, and company director (Neverfail Springwater, T-Corp, Federal Airports Corporation) was forged under the maiden name of Brenner ... The hurried family law agreement that sparked the Australian Securities and Investments Commission court order freezing the Riches' possessions when Jodee assigned $9 million of assets to Maxine two days after the One.Tel collapse has stunned friends and associates.</para></quote><para>Australian taxpayers have seen more than their fair share of corporate collapses. At the core of this issue, I believe, is the ethics or lack thereof in the minds of the `brat pack' generation of high-flyers who seek to act outside the taxation system, thinking that they are higher than the law and unaccountable to it. In bankruptcy proceedings it is very often the Australian Taxation Office that is the sole or principal creditor that has an equitable interest in the trustee in bankruptcy's trust assets—what little is left of them. We hear of residual distributions of half a cent in the dollar or one cent in the dollar. This is an insult to those creditors, usually the Australian taxpayers, who receive the crumbs of these `captains of industry' who, long before their well-orchestrated demise, have stripped their assets so as to place those assets out of the reach of their creditors.</para><para>We must never forget who is paying the real price for these impostors. It is the Australian taxpayer who is subsidising and paying for these criminals who take the money—money that is not theirs but debts that are due to the Australian Taxation Office—and run. How often have we heard of these `high rollers' who are truly admired? I quote again from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>reporting on the disbelief of friends and business associates of Maxine, who described Maxine as `unmaterialistic' and `philanthropic' and said it is `so un-Maxine, it just doesn't gel'.</para><para>Does it just not gel with other charlatans, such as former high-flying barristers I have identified over the last three years? Does it not gel with the likes of the notorious HIH collapse—which I notice is in the news today—and the carnage this collapse has caused with the ruin of those long-suffering, premium-paying Australian taxpayers who relied on the trust and leadership of the company directors? And what does this bill provide for dealing with the thoroughly discredited captains of industry in that field?</para><para>The point I make is that this bill is just one in a long line of tail-chasing; it is `patch quilt' legislation that seeks to shut the gate after the horse has bolted. Greed is a powerful driver. What is clear with this bill is that there is little to prevent high-rolling taxpayers from finding ever new and innovative means of defrauding the Commonwealth of its rightful revenue. The proposals in this bill intend to create a new supervised account regime; however, I question the intelligence of this option. </para><para>Another theme I have raised in debate on several bills in the House over the years is that the government has had a terrible habit of writing what I have described as `patch quilt' remedies. There is nothing new in this approach. This government and those of the 38th, 39th and 40th parliaments have routinely engaged in passing bills which have simply patched an apparent inconsistency between conflicts of law in order to put a bandaid on an existing problem. High-income earners can and do employ the best lawyers and accountants in a bid to find ever new and innovative ways of defrauding the Commonwealth. There is no apparent comprehensive strategy for dealing with the problem of defrauding the Commonwealth and looking after the interests of the honest Australian taxpayer.</para><para>Principally, this bill is flawed as it simply does what other bills have done. As with the Skase amendments and other taxation and administrative law amendments, bills are introduced with the intention of patching some identified legal matter which requires redress. Never do we see the work needed to comprehensively address the issue of defrauding the Commonwealth of its revenue. Members of this House will be aware of the specific provisions of Commonwealth criminal law, taxation, superannuation, family law, bankruptcy, insolvency, equity and trust laws. For all the sophistication apparent in bills such as the one before us, it is foolishness not to undertake this work. This bill is just one in a long line of bills that have attempted retrospectively to patch a discovered anomaly.</para><para>It is now painfully apparent that the innovativeness of greed will not be met by `patch quilt' remedies. The Commonwealth legislative history is replete with examples of how mutually exclusive legislative regimes have been allowed to surface independently of other legislative regimes. In this case we see an attempted patch between bankruptcy and family law. However, the bill does not attempt an integration with taxation, criminal or other laws that will have parallel legislative impacts.</para><para>To fair-minded citizens of good fame and character—that is, those who pay their fair share of taxes and do not defraud the Commonwealth of its revenue—legislative instruments are seen as licit instruments to be used for proper purposes. However, so-called captains of industry and high-income earners see these legal instruments, including family trusts, family law property orders, debtors petitions in bankruptcy law and other licit instruments, as simply an opportunity to be used for an illicit or illegitimate end. To these people, such instruments are simply more toys to play with, more opportunities to exploit the Australian taxpayer, for the benefit of keeping assets out of the reach of the Australian Taxation Office. Hence, it is profit by lies and deception. Society is bent on worshipping them as gods for their business and professional acumen, whilst all along they are nothing more than cheats and defrauders with criminal intent. For these reasons I support the amendments put forward by the opposition in the Senate on the rebuttable presumption of insolvency on the issue of failure by a bankrupt person to keep an adequate record of their transfer of property.</para><para>These amendments will greatly reinforce those debtors who abuse licit instruments, such as debtors petitions for an illicit end—that is, to defraud the Commonwealth of its revenue and place those assets out of the reach of the Australian Taxation Office. The rebuttable presumption test is sophisticated; it shifts the evidentiary burden onto the defendant bankrupt, who must prove that the asset transfer was not with the sole or substantial intent of placing the asset out of the reach of the Australian Taxation Office. Thus, the evidentiary burden on the trustee in bankruptcy is lessened and makes for better justice. It is also a valid application of the principle of double effect, in that the act of wrongly using a licit instrument such as a debtors petition with the good intention of having that petition available to the public as a means of settling debt is not abused in the future. </para><para>The days where a government endlessly chases its tail in a litany of `patch quilt' legislation must cease. Ethical considerations and a holistic approach to legislative drafting in all relevant areas of taxation, bankruptcy, insolvency, family, criminal, equity, administrative and other relevant laws must be undertaken, otherwise I fear this parliament will simply be introducing more and more interim bills like this one before the House today.</para><para>As sure as we sit here considering this bill today, there will be other high-flying people who are already finding ways to avoid the provisions of this legislation. For this reason it is necessary for the House to keep one step ahead and draft bills which are holistic and comprehensive. The government must address the problem of high-income earners using bankruptcy and family law to avoid paying tax debts while continuing to enjoy a lavish lifestyle made possible through the build-up of assets, usually in the name of their spouse.</para><para>Sadly, the bill is silent on the key bankruptcy controversy we have been pursuing—namely, the issue of high-income professionals using bankruptcy as a means of avoiding their taxation and other obligations. The opposition has exposed that hundreds of legal practitioners are not up to date with their tax returns. One QC had not lodged a taxation return for 45 years; one person had worked for the tax office for eight years and had not lodged a return; and another individual paid no income tax by declaring themself bankrupt on 12 occasions. I ask: how could this happen?</para><para>It is moral bankruptcy for a person to employ family and bankruptcy laws to put one's assets out of the reach of one's creditors. In most cases the only creditor, as I have said, is the taxation commissioner. Such avoidance is outrageous and it means that long-suffering taxpayers support tax rorters who continue to enjoy their life of luxury because their spouse owns all the family assets. As I have said before, these parasites on our taxation system enjoy all the benefits of the community—for example, they have a Medicare card, doubtlessly—and all at the expense of honest taxpayers like the 130,000 constituents whom I represent. My interest in this matter arose some three years ago.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ruddock</name></talker><para>—Only three?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83D</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name></talker><para>—The Attorney says, `Only three.' I am glad you interject. In 2000-01 the taxation commissioner identified the rorting by members of the legal profession, and today I want to pay tribute to those members of the legal profession project at the Australian Taxation Office who identified, if memory serves me, about 771 barristers who were not even up to date with their tax returns. Somewhere in the order of 60 barristers had been employing family law and bankruptcy law to put their assets out of reach of their creditors—of course, we know the creditor was always the taxation commissioner—to avoid paying their tax.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The thing that disturbed me when I became aware of this—and at the time it was written about extensively in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> by Paul Barry—was that the following year the taxation commissioner deleted reference to the work of the legal profession project from the tax office annual report. The Attorney asks why I have only been on it for three years. The Taxation Office had a very professional team that identified the problem, but, once it identified the scandalous behaviour of the very people in our community that you would expect to be paying their tax, for some reason the Commissioner of Taxation—I suggest from pressure from the government—deleted the work of the legal profession project, because the next year there was nothing. I invite the Attorney-General to look at the tax office annual report for 2001-02. He will find that there was no mention of that very good work done by the legal profession project. I do not think we would be standing here today in this House but for the work of that dedicated group of people in the tax office who identified the shocking behaviour of members of the legal profession. </para><para>I put a question on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> three years ago and it took 12 months, Attorney, for the Treasurer to answer it. It was a simple question about the percentage of barristers and solicitors who paid the top marginal rate of tax. Twelve months later I got an answer which confirmed that less than 50 per cent of members of the legal profession paid the top marginal rate. But that reply was very clouded, because it cited the industry codes that the Taxation Office uses to identify those groups and the tax they pay or do not pay. Members of the legal profession go under code 78410, which apart from barristers and solicitors includes advocates and people employed in conveyancing and legal aid—not necessarily people with legal qualifications. So it is probably fair to say that a significantly higher proportion than 50 per cent of the legal profession is not paying the top marginal rate of tax. I am sure that would come as a surprise to many people.</para><para>I was surprised that the Treasurer took so long to answer that question, but I know the occupation he was in before he entered the parliament. I also pursued the then Attorney-General, Mr Daryl Williams, and I know what occupation he had before he entered parliament. And I pursued the Prime Minister, and I know what occupation he was in before he came into this House. I say that in response to the earlier interjection by the Attorney, because I felt that the government was embarrassed—particularly as the government is replete with members of the legal profession, including the Prime Minister and others on the frontbench—into protecting members of the legal profession. I thought it was sending a very poor message to most law-abiding taxpayers that somehow or other the work of the legal profession project had to be buried because it was so embarrassing that, of all people, members of the legal profession were not paying their tax.</para><para>I want to give credit to Michael Carmody and to Bret Walker, who was president of the New South Wales Bar Association. Mr Walker came to see me. He was terribly embarrassed and very concerned about the behaviour of some members of the legal profession. We are talking about 770 barristers who were not even up to date with their tax returns, and a significant proportion of them were using bankruptcy and family law to put their assets out of reach of their creditors. The only creditor of note, of course, as we have said, was the taxation commissioner. The commissioner was very alarmed about that and wanted to do everything to try and help get a resolution to this, so I pay tribute to him as well.</para><para>I asked stacks of questions of the Treasurer and I was just given the sailor's farewell on most occasions, but a very interesting issue was raised around section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, relating to secrecy provisions. Bret Walker did not agree with the taxation commissioner that the commissioner could not write to a peak professional body like the Law Society—it could be the AMA—and say, `This person has been bankrupt six times.' We did have a case of someone, not a member of the legal profession, who had been bankrupt 12 times. How could this happen? That made a nonsense of the secrecy provisions. Nothing has been done about that to date, and I believe—and Bret Walker, who is a pretty learned senior counsel, has made it quite clear—that section 16 of the act allows the taxation commissioner to let these peak professional bodies know if people are rorting the taxation system, so they can be struck off and not continue this dishonest practice. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>44</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—I thank the honourable members who have contributed to this debate on the <inline ref="S426">Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline>—the members for Gellibrand, Fisher and Lowe. Before I proceed to deal with the clauses let me say on my own behalf and on behalf of government that we have no truck with people who avoid their proper obligations to contribute to tax. That was inculcated in me from a very young age by a father who had worked at a very senior level in government here in Canberra. He recognised that, if people want services from government, they have to make a reasonable contribution. As far as I am concerned I will deal expeditiously but properly with defects in the system as they come to notice.</para></talk.start><para>The honourable member for Lowe should have acknowledged perhaps that, in relation to the matter of Rich and Rich, very shortly after I was appointed Attorney-General I moved to amend the relevant provisions of the Family Law Act to see that arrangements for entering into the organisation of people's family affairs would be reviewed by courts. It was something that could be dealt with expeditiously, and was. It led to a situation where the particular family arrangement in that case was aborted. I will continue to deal with those matters as quickly as I can. But I have to do it with advice and I have to do it in a way which I am satisfied is going to achieve the proper purpose. The fact is, as I mentioned in the parliament the other day, we have been dealing with the issues relating to barristers using bankruptcy as a way of avoiding their proper obligations. At the Commonwealth's instigation, states and territories are taking action to ensure that bankrupt barristers who avoid their debts cannot practice. It is a matter that we took up at SCAG to get the states and territories dealing with those issues, because they are responsible for supervising the profession. Where we brief barristers, we have asked all departments and agencies to ensure that they do not brief counsel who use bankruptcy as a means of avoiding tax. I made those points in answer to a question in the House earlier in the session.</para><para>In relation to the use of parliamentary committees—this was raised by the member for Fisher—I am one of those who does value their work when committees are prepared to work together in a bipartisan way and I do look at the comments that they are prepared to make. It is one of the reasons I made a reference, and will continue to make references, to relevant committees to get advice and assistance.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83K</name.id><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Roxon</name></talker><para>—You took action before you had the report.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>—No, it was to ensure that we were able to make clear what the government's response would be in relation to a matter where I believed there needed to be a public exposure and for the difficult questions to be able to be addressed with public comment. It became quite clear from the response that we had been getting what course needed to be followed. I dealt with it in the way which I did because of the arguments that had been presented before the committee, which I had heard. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me deal with the way in which legislation is progressed in this place. I am very cognisant of the need, and from time to time have acceded to requests, to delay the debates in this place so that the opposition can follow the consultative procedures that it wishes to engage in to ensure that its party members are fully across bills and can be appropriately briefed. At times, on request, I have recognised that. I would hope that the opposition would recognise that the government have certain procedures that we have to go through as well. While I might like to give people notice of what we are intending to do, I cannot do it before I have policy approval at senior level and before our own party room procedures have been followed. That means that there needs to be committee consideration of these matters and party room approval of a bill. When I have that I am in a position to be able to take the matter to the opposition, and I do. But one ought not to be critical of the way in which these issues are dealt with when we are merely undertaking the same sorts of procedures involving the members of the government parties which the opposition expects to be able to have accommodated in relation to its dealing with these matters.</para><para>The government welcome the support of the opposition for the bill in principle while recognising the continuing concern about anti-avoidance schemes to avoid taxation and other debts. These concerns are ones that the government have very strongly on board, but we do believe that there needs to be a considered and consultative approach to resolve some of the outstanding issues. The amendments in this bill are the government's substantial and considered response to the recommendations from the joint task force on the use of bankruptcy and family law schemes to avoid tax. These are important reforms developed in consultation with the experts in the area of insolvency, business and family law. The amendments will help to close legal loopholes which presently allow some high-income earners to avoid their debts. They will also help resolve longstanding uncertainties in the interaction of bankruptcy and family law.</para><para>One of the major benefits of this bill is that it provides a concurrent jurisdiction in family law and bankruptcy law so that competing claims in these areas of law can be determined at the same time and in the same forum. This gives greater transparency and fairness to both creditors and spouses in resolving their claims by offering protections and procedures that were not previously available. For example, under the terms of this bill, in a situation where a couple separate after one spouse has become bankrupt, the court exercising jurisdiction under the Family Law Act 1975 can now deal with the claims of the non-bankrupt spouse and recognise his or her interests. Also, the trustee in bankruptcy will be able to stand in the shoes of the bankrupt's spouse in family law proceedings to represent the interests of creditors. The bill also targets the misuse of family law schemes, such as binding financial agreements, to defeat the interest of creditors. Further, the bill offers an improved regime for the collection of contributions from bankrupts in cases that have previously been difficult to enforce, such as self-employed persons.</para><para>The bill has been considered by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Some of the family law amendments in the bill previously contained in another family law bill have been considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The bill takes into account the recommendations of these committees and reflects the significant views of stakeholders on these amendments. The government has recently released a discussion paper and commenced consultation on the development of the best package of anti-avoidance reforms to address the problems of high-income earners avoiding their debt and taxation obligations. This bill is not the government's total response on anti-avoidance matters. The government does seek to allow proper consultation to occur so that these reforms can proceed as effectively and comprehensively as possible. </para><para>Item 6A of schedule 1 to the bill was inserted by another place as an opposition amendment. It is the only item in the bill dealing with anti-avoidance. The government intends to move an amendment to remove this item. It is, in our view, premature and an inadequate response to the problem of debt and taxation avoidance. It has not been the subject of consultation. I know it was a bipartisan recommendation of the inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that there be fresh consultation to strengthen the existing provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, and the government is in fact proceeding with that consultation. Finally, I again thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate and commend the bill to the House. I will move the amendment at the appropriate time.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration in Detail</title><page.no>46</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>46</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum and move government amendment (1).</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 6A, page 4 (line 26) to page 5 (line 13), omit the item.</para></quote><para>As I said earlier, another place passed an amendment to the bill inserting item 6A in schedule 1. The government does not support the amendment in that form and will be seeking to deal with the issues more comprehensively in time. The amendment will create two rebuttable presumptions of insolvency for the purposes of claw-back provisions in the Bankruptcy Act 1966. These presumptions would arise where a bankrupt had an outstanding tax return or returns and where a bankrupt had failed to keep adequate books, accounts and records when required by law to do so. However, it is unlikely that these presumptions would be wholly effective as they would be quite easy to rebut. They would not operate in circumstances where the bankrupt had transferred property shortly after lodging a tax return but then lodged no further returns and became insolvent.</para><para>The government also has reservations about solving tax avoidance problems by using bankruptcy policy in this way. The amendment moved in the other place is included in the suggestions canvassed in a discussion paper which I released on 8 February. That discussion paper will allow stakeholders to give their views on a comprehensive package of reforms needed to address problems of high-income earners using bankruptcy to avoid debts that they can afford to pay. It would be preferable to allow this consultation to occur to ensure that the most effective package of amendments is developed. At this stage it would be premature to accept this amendment which has not been the subject of any consultation. </para><para>In addition, it was a bipartisan recommendation of the inquiry of the House of Representatives standing committee that there should be fresh consultation, and that consultation has now occurred. I do seek to deal with these issues as quickly as possible. I will not be reticent in bringing forward the results of consultation with further amendments. I want to see these issues effectively dealt with, but I want to see that done in a way which will not leave us exposed to possible weaknesses that may be drawn to our attention in the consultation process. I do not wish that provisions that we have leave us vulnerable, in the sense that we have purported to cover the field and then find that there are ways of circumventing those requirements. I think it needs to be dealt with comprehensively and, for that reason, I propose the government amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>47</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This item over which there is difference between the government and the opposition is about closing down opportunities for tax avoiders.

And we as a community pay twice for the government's reticence to deal with this issue today: not only do we miss out on the tax revenue but we also harm the creditors and small businesses who end up not having their debts paid. It is one thing to say that you are pro business, but to give the green light to those who are abusing the system in this way is harming business and the whole community. By voting for the government's amendment today, government members of this House will be allowing those on some of the highest incomes, living some of the highest lifestyles, to continue to do so for a longer period of time at the expense of the rest of the community.

Labor strongly supports the passage of the bill; the implementation of education standards pursuant to the Disability Discrimination Act is long overdue. It is an important step, and one which we had all hoped would have been taken long before now. In fact, this process began in the years of the Keating government—which demonstrates how drawn out the process has been and probably how complicated many of the issues are. </para></talk.start><para>We remain concerned, however, that the government has not looked at how the implementation of the standards can be funded. We dispute the fact that this bill will not result in any extra cost, and strongly believe that the Commonwealth government should put its money where its mouth is to support the important aims of the act and the introduction of the education standards to improve the position of, and opportunities for, disabled people in education and training.</para><para>The government has released a final draft of the standards, which are intended to clarify and elaborate upon the obligations of education and training providers in relation to students with disabilities. The standards will be tabled in parliament some time following the passage of this bill. The bill amends the act to support the draft education standards by: introducing and defining the term `education provider', providing that it is unlawful for education providers to discriminate on the ground of disability in the development or accreditation of curricula or training courses, providing that education providers may be required to develop strategies and programs to prevent the harassment and victimisation of students with disabilities, extending the defence of unjustifiable hardship in education to post-enrolment situations, and clarifying that disability standards made under section 31 may require reasonable adjustments to be made in order to avoid unlawful discrimination on the ground of disability.</para><para>Section 31 of the Disability Discrimination Act provides that the Attorney-General may formulate standards in relation to a number of areas covered by the DDA, including education of people with a disability. As I said at the start, work on these standards has been under way since 1995, with the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs being involved in two consultation processes with relevant stakeholders in 1997 and 2000. There is strong support in the disability sector for the standards to be introduced, to help address access issues for students with a disability and remove barriers to their full inclusion in the education environment.</para><para>The education standards must be implemented as quickly as possible to ensure access for students with a disability, but this will not be without significant cost. We strongly support the bill but I would like to place on the record our concern at the lack of consultation with the states, which will have the major responsibility for bringing education facilities up to standard. Our concern is not with the lack of consultation over the standards themselves but with the lack of consultation on their implementation and the cost of that implementation.</para><para>In the most recent Senate inquiry into this bill, several states made submissions contesting the Commonwealth government's view that there will be no financial impact upon the passage of the legislation and the introduction of the standards. We are therefore greatly concerned at the fact that the costs will fall heavily on the states—and the failure of the Commonwealth government to make a contribution is a significant issue.</para><para>In 2003, all state and territory members of the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs—except for Tasmania and the ACT—voted against the Commonwealth's move to introduce the standards. While they agree with the content and intent, the states and territories were not prepared to move forward unless the Commonwealth agreed to share the costs of implementation—which it is considered will be significant—and a phase-in of the standards.</para><para>The Commonwealth has moved unilaterally to have this bill passed and the standards introduced. There is strong support from education authorities and disability groups for the principles behind the bill. However several states are arguing that the cost implications are likely to be significant, and the Commonwealth is not providing any extra resources to assist with implementation. Clearly, this is worrying a number of those who have to provide the facilities and services on the ground. </para><para>It is clear that new subsection 31(1A), while it may require only minor changes to teaching practice or equipment provision, could result in major capital expenditure being required of an education provider. MCEETYA specifically raised this issue in the development of the standards as a possible impediment in the implementation phase. This government is clearly trying to steamroll the states in this cost-shifting exercise and has been unwilling to meet its responsibilities in sharing costs. While we are willing to accept the passage of this legislation, because we strongly believe in improving access for students with disabilities, we are gravely concerned that the money will not be available to make sure that the bill, once passed, and the standards, once introduced, will be able to work effectively.</para><para>There is also some concern from parent groups that the extended defence of unjustifiable hardship is a major trade-off for the other beneficial aspects of the bill—that is, that their children may in fact experience increased discrimination because underresourced schools will be able to enrol their children but continually refuse to make necessary adjustments for their full inclusion. This is a worrying area, where the issues of financing and principle interact with each other. Labor support the bill, but we call on the government to immediately undertake negotiations with state and territory education authorities and come to an agreed cost-sharing arrangement. Labor also reiterate the 2004 Senate committee's comments that the final education standards should be introduced as soon as possible.</para><para>In summary, we have some concerns about aspects of this legislation and its implementation but these concerns cannot override the very important benefits that this bill and the education standards will provide for disabled students. The goal to eliminate discrimination against people with a disability in education is enormously important. The right of every person and every child to an education is essential, and this parliament must do all it can to ensure that this right is available to everyone, regardless of any disability they may have.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>51</page.no><name role="metadata">Richardson, Kym, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RICHARDSON</name><name.id>E0B</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the <inline ref="R2209">Disability Discrimination Amendment (Education Standards) Bill 2004</inline>. My counterpart just mentioned the cost implication to a school. That school could perhaps apply for funding under the Howard government's direct funding for building alterations or infrastructure. The purpose of this bill is to establish a framework and legislative base which will give the best possible support to the education standards to be tabled in this parliament shortly. The Disability Discrimination Act 1992 allows the Attorney-General to develop disability standards in a wide variety of areas. One such area is the education of individuals with a disability. In June 2004 the government released for public information a final draft of the disability standards for education. These standards have been developed through extensive consultation with a wide variety of education providers, as well as with the disability sector and interested members of the public.</para></talk.start><para>The operation of the act differs marginally from the final draft of the standards, and that brings us to the specific achievements of this bill. The aim of this bill is to bring the legislation into line with those standards. The disability sector is eagerly awaiting the introduction of these standards, because they will finally provide the clarity and direction the industry so desperately needs in relation to students and prospective students with a disability. This government is dedicated not only to serving the disability sector but to doing so in the most effective manner possible. For that reason we have not introduced these standards without first seeking these amendments, for the simple reason that the industry and the community alike need the standards to be fully supported in legislation, without ambiguity, if they are to achieve their desired result. </para><para>The term `education provider' is used throughout the draft standards; it is a term used to describe educational authorities, institutions and organisations whose purpose is to develop or accredit curricula and training courses. The term `education provider' is neither defined nor used in the Disability Discrimination Act. This bill seeks to remove that anomaly, and to do so by defining the term with reference to terms already used and defined in the existing legislation. This bill also takes the very important step of making it unlawful for education providers to develop or approve any form of curricula or training course which would have the effect of excluding individuals with a disability from participation or which would otherwise subject them to detriment.</para><para>Individuals with a disability are not simply dealing with the physical impediments posed by their disability; they are also faced with the ever-growing challenge of overcoming the perceptions held by others and, in some cases, learning to deal with harassment and victimisation. This bill seeks to require education providers to become proactive in the prevention of harassment and victimisation. It will require providers to develop and implement strategies and programs which will prevent such behaviour, and to educate staff and students about the policies and the consequences if victimisation or harassment occurs. We are talking about a provision which ensures that a group who are already disadvantaged by circumstance are not further inhibited from accessing education because they are subject to the soul-destroying acts of others.</para><para>In proposing this bill, the government has not simply shifted the burden of preventing discrimination onto education providers. This bill provides for the extension of the `unjustifiable hardship' defence to cover post-enrolment situations, as well as curriculum development and accreditation, student support services and proposals for the elimination of harassment and victimisation. This bill affords education providers the ability to avoid provisions of this bill which would place the provider in a situation of undue hardship. The extension of this defence ensures that education will not be taking on the entire burden of eliminating disability discrimination in education.</para><para>Finally, this bill seeks to amend section 31 of the Disability Discrimination Act by allowing the disability standards to require reasonable adjustments to be made by education providers to eliminate, as far as possible, discrimination on the ground of disability. The Howard government made a public commitment in the joint statement by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Education, Science and Training on 15 June 2004. They made a commitment to the disability sector, to education providers and to the Australian people that they would introduce legislation which would ensure full legislative support for the draft disability standards for education. I stand before the House today to assist my government in delivering on that commitment. I increasingly meet with constituents in my electorate of Kingston who have a disability but who seek employment, and I regularly come in contact with service providers who place individuals with a disability into employment. The benefit to the community, to employers and to those individuals with a disability who obtain employment cannot be denied. I can tell you first-hand, Mr Deputy Speaker, that one of the major steps to ensuring higher levels of employment amongst this group is providing them with education. </para><para>This bill provides a base which will enable the disability standards for education to remove a massive roadblock currently preventing those with a disability from accessing education. The Howard government are dedicated to the education of Australians, and by that we mean all Australians. Australians with a disability face very real barriers when it comes to accessing education because those barriers are not always visible or obvious and they are not always dealt with. That stops today with the passage of this bill; that stops with the introduction of the disability standards for education. In the hope that it will make a difference in the lives of those with a disability, I commend this bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>53</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Congratulations, Mr Deputy Speaker, on joining the Speaker's panel.

At the outset, I want to say a couple of things about two schools in my electorate that do an outstanding job, along with many, many other schools. The first is Banksia Secondary College, which is a fantastic school. I remember being part of a most extraordinary end of year awards presentation at the school in which one of the school captains, Nick Brock, who is deaf, delivered his speech and ran the assembly using Auslan, and there was somebody there interpreting for him. It was an incredibly special afternoon, and a tribute to the wonderful efforts of the school. That school has a number of children with disabilities, some mild but some extremely disabling. There are some students with cerebral palsy and a significant number of students who are hearing impaired.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The second is the wonderful Rosanna Golf Links Primary School that has the regional deaf facility located within the school. It is a great tribute to the staff and the parents of Rosanna Golf Links to see the fantastic way in which the hearing impaired children are integrated into the school. There is separate learning time when there is very highly focused education for the children who are deaf, but they spend a lot of their time in the ordinary classrooms with all the other kids, and it is a wonderful thing to see the way in which they develop.</para><para>In both schools, one of the most special occasions is to see them all singing together. This happened while I was at Banksia, and I know it will happen at Rosanna Golf Links when I go there shortly to present their leadership awards. It is amazing to see the children using their voices to sing alongside children who are signing, whether the national anthem or other songs. It is a very moving experience.</para><para>It is very important that we support this legislation today to amend the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 so that we can have disability standards properly introduced into all of our educational facilities. I think it has taken far too long, frankly, for these standards to be introduced, so I am a very strong supporter of them going through this parliament. The whole purpose of the standards is to make sure the Disability Discrimination Act is being applied in our schools. Of course, the standards set out not only the rights of students but also the legal obligations of education and training providers. The standards provided for under the bill will detail how education systems have to meet their obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act. They are a very important step towards ensuring—not only in the schools I mentioned at the start of my remarks today but in every single school, TAFE or university—full participation in and equal access to education for people with a disability. </para><para>The disability standards will make sure that education providers take all reasonable measures to deliver equitable access to educational programs for students with disabilities. Providers will be able to claim unjustifiable hardship, such as the cost of capital upgrading or equipment, but I certainly hope the Commonwealth government, the state government and non-government providers of education do everything they possibly can to make sure these standards are met, because they are designed to protect the interests of students with disabilities.</para><para>The standards are all about making sure that students with disabilities have access to schools and other educational facilities so they can participate in the curriculum and related programs on the same basis as other children and young people. As is the case at Banksia Secondary College, schools have come a very long way over the last decade, but they do need additional support and guidance to make sure they provide equal access to people with a disability.</para><para>Compliance with disability standards for education is an important investment. We know that providing equal access is a very big task, because there are about 100,000 students with disabilities in our schools, both special schools and regular schools. Eighty per cent of students with disabilities attend government schools. The number of students with disabilities receiving integration support to help them in regular schools has grown significantly over the last decade—I think it has trebled.</para><para>So there has been a very significant increase in the number of students with disabilities being `mainstreamed' into government schools. It is probably the case now that almost every government school would have enrolled at least one student with a disability. State and territory governments provide over 95 per cent of funding for students with disabilities in government schools. As in other areas, the Commonwealth government is the major source of public funds for students with disabilities in non-government schools—in fact, over two-thirds of the public funding in those schools.</para><para>Students can have a very wide range of disabilities, whether it is intellectual disability, sensory disability, vision or hearing impairment, physical disability, one of a very wide range of social, emotional or behavioural disabilities, or developmental delay. It is often the case that students have multiple disabilities, and these are significant issues for students, teachers and parents to deal with in school. Some students also have other forms of disadvantage, whether it is isolation, poverty, being Indigenous, social deprivation or so on. We have a very significant challenge, particularly for the schools in those environments.</para><para>There are some students with disabilities who are still educated in special schools, and these special schools provide a very important educational environment for those students. There are about 20,000 students in these separate special schools—that is, about 15 to 20 per cent of all children with disabilities. The remainder are in our regular primary and secondary schools. Interestingly, about two-thirds are in primary schools. </para><para>I think everyone in this House knows that the students and teachers in schools, whether they are special schools or regular schools, certainly need extra support. Some of the students need in-class aids—of course, these are the students with more serious disabilities—to help them with their school work and often with other activities around the school as well. There are good systems in place in some schools to provide support through additional consultants who provide advice to teachers, additional print or ICT materials and a range of other integration supports. At each and every school that I go to, this is one of the major issues raised with me. Teachers are feeling under enormous pressure from the demands to respond positively to the needs of the increasing numbers of students with disabilities in their schools. Of course the teachers welcome these children into their classrooms, but I think we have to recognise that it puts a lot of pressure on the teachers. I am sure each and every one of us wants to do the best we can to help them. This area is crying out for more professional-learning programs. Teachers want to be better equipped to deal with the range of children with disabilities. Teachers want their knowledge, skills and teaching and learning methods expanded so that they can do their best by both the children with disabilities and the other children in the classroom.</para><para>We also could be doing better in our universities and TAFEs. About six per cent of people doing vocational education and training have a disability, including about 90,000 Australians with a disability at TAFE. There are about 24,000 Australians with a disability studying at our universities. That is about 3½ per cent of all of our Australian students. These disability standards are important not only in our schools but also at TAFEs and in universities so that young people and the mature aged are able to go on to get further qualifications and the skills they need to get a good job. Those students at TAFEs and in universities not only need their teachers to have the skills to educate people with disabilities but also particularly need access to equipment and curriculum materials so that they can succeed in their studies.</para><para>Parents with children who have disabilities also have particular needs. They probably need more time with their teachers, especially at school, to help with the education of their children. It is important for schools to have that extra time to develop individual learning plans for the children and to take account of the individual needs that different children have.</para><para>One of the big areas of expense is the capital adjustment schools and other educational institutions need so that students with disabilities can access schools, in particular, but also TAFE and universities. This applies to major capital areas, like lifts for educational institutions, and other areas, especially facilities for the hearing impaired and the visually impaired. All of these people need particular capital adjustments to be made so that they can participate in the teaching and learning programs that are available and be successful.</para><para>We need some system-wide reforms. Updated curriculum material and better production of equipment would also assist in many of our educational institutions. There has been some independent analysis, such as a paper by the Allen Consulting Group for the Department of Education, Science and Training and the 2004 report of the Productivity Commission. These reports support the development of standards but, most importantly, acknowledge that there are costs associated with the development of these standards. I do not think there is any doubt that implementing the standards will see future education and training of Australians with disabilities improve, but it is a cost that needs to be shared by the Commonwealth, the states and the non-government authorities. </para><para>We have had some warning about this. There was a Senate inquiry not long ago that warned the government of the challenges facing our educational authorities when they provide quality services for people with a disability. This inquiry reported in December 2002:</para><quote><para>There is unambiguous evidence of under-resourcing of programs aimed at bringing students with disabilities into the mainstream of learning; as well as funding inconsistencies between states.</para></quote><para>The committee reported `evidence that the proportion of students with an identified disability is increasing' at a much greater rate than the overall student population. One of the reasons for that is that there is much more effective early diagnosis and continuing successes in medical intervention. Both of these things are good developments, but it is adding to the cost of delivering education.</para><para>One area that the committee particularly reflected on was the better understanding of the nature of disability particularly, for example, in the area of autism. I am sure that many members have been in schools where there are children with autism. That particular condition provides challenges both to the staff of the schools and to the parents of the children who have that condition. The Senate committee made the important point that school authorities are moving from remediation, which used to be the way to early diagnosis and mainstreaming of programs. I have no doubt that these strategies will be much more effective in the longer run, but all of us have to face up to the resource pressures that are on our schools, TAFEs and universities now.</para><para>The committee made quite a few recommendations and I urge the government to have another look at the Senate inquiry's report and the recommendations that were made. I think they were all very practical, sensible recommendations that would have a very positive effect if the government took them up and introduced them. Unfortunately, we have not had that response from the government. We have this bill today, which I strongly support, but we do need to go further and to recognise that this government has a responsibility to share in the cost of meeting these standards. Unfortunately, when it comes to children in government schools, we have not had any funding above indexation for students with disabilities since 1996 from this government. That is certainly an area where we could do with some improvement. It is also the case that students with disabilities in nongovernment schools, particularly the more needy ones, are crying out for more support. I met with the Associations of Christian Schools this week and once again they raised this issue with me; they too have urgent needs. The 80 per cent of students with disabilities who depend on the public system could certainly do with increased support from this government, as could the students with disabilities in nongovernment schools.</para><para>Finally, I just want to touch on some other initiatives that we took to the last election because it is an area that I think that we could certainly do better in once these standards are implemented. We had particular initiatives both in government and in nongovernment schools. They included additional funding not only for capital equipment and ICT infrastructure, both of which are very important if we are going to meet these disability standards, but also for helping teachers in schools to deliver the intensive support that the students with disabilities in both regular and special schools need. Some of the things that we would have spent that money on were more teacher aides in classrooms, more time for classroom teachers to be able to provide personalised teaching, better professional development for classroom teachers and teacher aides, better equipment for students—particularly with physical and intellectual disabilities—and so on. I am very pleased to say that we did have a very comprehensive approach to this area but, all that having been said, I really do want to lend my strong support to the introduction of these standards. But I say to the government that to make these standards work and to make sure they are delivered in all of our educational institutions will require additional financial support from the Commonwealth. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>57</page.no><name role="metadata">Elson, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs ELSON</name><name.id>6K6</name.id><electorate>Forde</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very proud to speak today on this <inline ref="R2209">Disability Discrimination Amendment (Education Standards) Bill 2004</inline> that furthers the rights of people living with a disability. I note that this bill was first introduced in August last year but, of course, it lapsed when the election was called the following month. I commend the Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, for re-introducing it so quickly. The Howard government has worked hard since being elected to further support and improve opportunities for people with disabilities and to help and support their families to access greater respite and care services. Of course there is still more to be done, and I am working hard with the local organisations in my electorate of Forde to secure more funding for services in our region. This will be an ongoing battle, particularly when the state Labor governments are withdrawing services in some areas. I will outline that in detail later, but I am very pleased to be able to speak today on this bill, which goes one step further in enabling the introduction of the disability standards for education.</para></talk.start><para>Members of this House would be aware that before entering politics I worked as a coordinator for the Handicapped Association—now the Horizon Foundation—and Multicap, a service provider for people with multiple disabilities. In these roles I had the opportunity to see at first hand the daily struggles of people living with a range of disabilities, from mild to more severe. I gained a very deep understanding of their desire to be active, contributing members of their communities and to be accepted as a valued part of society. On a daily basis I learnt much from their constant displays of courage, their determination and their willingness to appreciate the true value of life.</para><para>Modern medicine advances have, fortunately, vastly improved the treatment of many conditions, thereby improving the quality of life of people living with a disability. It is estimated that around 20 per cent of Australians live with some form of disability. For some people this will mean an extra daily challenge, but essentially many people living with a disability are able to hold down full-time jobs, lead an active life and play a very important part in our communities. For others, their disability affects their daily life to a greater degree and they require a larger range of support services.</para><para>The most comprehensive data collected on the range of disability services provided by both the Commonwealth and the states is the recent Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report <inline font-style="italic">Disability support services 2002-2003</inline>. That report found that a total of $2.9 billion was spent in 2002 to 2003 on direct services for those living with a disability and their families. Accommodation support services accounted for 51 per cent of the total funding; community access services were 12 per cent; community support services, 10 per cent; employment services, nine per cent; and respite services, six per cent, or around $172 million. </para><para>As I said at the outset, our government has worked hard to deliver more services and assistance for people living with a disability, including the $1.7 billion Australians Working Together package, which offers more employment services and opportunities. Of course, education and training is a major factor in employment opportunities and advancement. Sadly, the Productivity Commission review of the Disability Discrimination Act found that exclusion from education and training is one of the most serious forms of disability discrimination. The setting of disability standards for education is expected to go some way towards addressing this inequity and setting out clear guidelines for the provision of education services.</para><para>Our approach with this bill, as always, is balanced. We want to improve access and make people with a disability more aware of their rights, while at the same time ensuring, through the provisions about unjustifiable hardship, that education providers are not unduly disadvantaged. It is a sensible and balanced approach, and I am hoping that the Queensland state government will take note.</para><para>Once again I am asking in this House that the Queensland Premier, Mr Beattie, look at the impact that the review of special needs funding by Education Queensland has had on disabled children and their families. Many disabled children had their teaching support seriously cut, which resulted in special needs children being placed in ordinary classrooms with little or no assistance. In late 2003, Education Queensland dropped the ascertainment level of nearly 1,000 disabled children, which in turn meant their teaching support was reduced or even entirely dropped.</para><para>At the special education development unit at Mount Warren Park, a school in my electorate, parents who do secure a place in this unit for their children have been dismayed to find that a vital service like speech therapy is virtually nonexistent. I repeat: the vital, basic service of speech therapy is nonexistent. We are talking about children aged from three to six years, a vital stage for speech development. These children are being denied access to speech therapy for whole semesters at a time. When they do have contact with a therapist, it is generally only for a very short period, one day a week—and that is only if they are lucky, as the parents tell me. Mainly the therapist conducts assessments, rather than actually working with the child to make improvements. As a mother, I can only imagine how frustrating this situation is for parents of children with special needs.</para><para>These parents have been fundraising like crazy to pay for an additional speech therapist to help their children, but, as this is only a small unit, that is an enormous task to ask of these parents. After all, we are talking about the basics here. As one parent put it to me, `Communication is the essence of our society.' If we cannot give our young children the opportunity to communicate to the very best of their ability, what chance do they have to overcome any difficulties they may face later on in life?</para><para>Despite ongoing representations from me and from parents—we even took petitions up—this situation remains unchanged. The local Labor state member, Margaret Keech, is unwilling or unable to do anything, and the state government just do not seem to be listening. They do not seem to be listening to her, the parents, me or our special needs support groups within our community.</para><para>I am hoping that, eventually, the introduction of the disability education standards will support our efforts to lobby the state government and add weight to the concerns of parents, who know the needs of their children best. It should not have to come to this. I should not be standing here once again. It is simply common sense to ensure that funding for speech therapy services for young children seeking to overcome development and learning difficulties should be allocated to this school so these parents' children at least get a chance in life. </para><para>Again, I ask the Queensland Premier to have Education Queensland urgently review the level of support and assistance available to children with disabilities, including those with mild impairment. These are often the ones who slip through the cracks, come out the other end of the system and—not having any support—have problems later on in life. This is a shocking situation. More resources clearly need to be allocated to help these special needs children. While various state governments try to dodge it, it is very clear that responsibility for the delivery of primary and secondary education services rests with them. They have a duty to deliver these services to everyone, including these people living with disabilities.</para><para>The Queensland government has received and continues to receive more funding than expected through GST revenue. It is worth noting that every cent of the GST goes directly to the states and territories to fund such things as roads, schools and hospital services. Every state and territory has received more than they expected in GST revenues in the past few years, yet they have failed to properly deliver the basic services that they really ought to deliver. The Labor Party are always big on their rhetoric when it comes to services, but their track record at state government level is one not just of inaction but of actually cutting funding for many vital services. The states really need to be brought to account.</para><para>Even in relation to this bill, several states tried to delay the introduction of the education standards. As the members of the Disability Discrimination Act Standards Project put it in their press release of 11 July 2003:</para><quote><para>We are disappointed that some of the States and Territories attempted to once again delay the introduction of the Education Standards.</para><para>To our delight, the Commonwealth Minister, Dr Brendan Nelson, has exercised his leadership. Dr Nelson recognises that after seven and half years of development, the Education Standards are now in agreement, and that legal and financial concerns have been resolved through independent inquiry.</para></quote><para>I, too, commend the minister and thank him for his leadership on this issue.</para><para>I am very proud to be part of a government that is taking the lead on these issues and that is working hard to improve these services and support the people who are living with disabilities. I look forward to working within government to secure more funding for effective programs. As I said, there is still more to be done in my electorate, but I will continue the fight down here for them. Unfortunately, I am going to conclude my speech very shortly because I am suffering from the flu and a sore throat, and I do not think it is going to do anyone any good for me to stand here coughing for the rest of this speech.</para><para>In closing, I would like to congratulate volunteers and providers of disability services within my electorate of Forde. They are all very dedicated and caring people. They work extremely hard to ensure that people and children with disabilities have a better and fulfilling quality of life.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>59</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON</name><name.id>DYH</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in favour of the <inline ref="R2209">Disability Discrimination Amendment (Education Standards) Bill 2004</inline>. As we have heard already, the bill proposes relatively minor amendments to ensure that the disability standards for education are supported to the greatest possible extent by the legislation. The standards do vary the operation of the DDA in some minor ways. Accordingly, the bill was prepared following legal advice that it is desirable to amend the legislation to remove any uncertainty and to avoid any potential challenges to its validity. </para></talk.start><para>The disability standards for education will be applied to government and non-government providers in all education sectors: preschool, school, vocational education and training, higher education and even adult and community education. They will also apply to organisations whose purpose is to develop and accredit curricula and courses—if you like, third-party providers. This is to ensure that these bodies consider the needs of students with disabilities up front in the design and accreditation of curricula which will be used by other schools and education providers. The standards cover the areas of enrolment; participation; curriculum development, delivery and accreditation; student support services; and the elimination of harassment and victimisation, to the extent that that is possible. These areas have been identified as covering all areas required for a student's access to and participation in education or training.</para><para>This legislation also provides reasonable adjustments to put students with disabilities on the same basis as other students. The standards recognise that to overcome the disadvantage arising from their disability students with disabilities need to be treated differently to remove or reduce barriers to their participation in education. The standards operate on the principle that students with disabilities should be provided with opportunities that place them on the same basis as other students so that they can achieve and realise their own potential in education and training. It is, of course, the goal of every parent in Australia to see their child achieve their potential, whether or not they have a disability or special needs.</para><para>To achieve this, the standards set out a process for determining and providing a reasonable adjustment. This is a measure or an action that enables the student to enrol and participate. As the forms of disability recognised by the act and the standards are wide ranging, in order to identify and make an adjustment which is appropriate to that student's disability education providers are required to consult with the student or their associate or parent. The consultation may also include an independent expert opinion to assist in that process. An adjustment is only required to be reasonable, and this is an important point. That is to balance the interests of all the parties who are affected, including the student with the disability, the school or education provider, staff and also other students.</para><para>I am advised that in any one year in Australia there are more than 200,000 students with a disability across all of the different sectors that I have described. This number is, interestingly enough, increasing over time. Definitions do vary across the sectors for reporting these statistics. In the school sector the number of students with disabilities is reported by the state and territory governments and non-government school authorities, while in the higher education and vocational education and training sectors students are self-identified. Notwithstanding these definitional issues, in 2003 there were 210,000 students with a disability across all sectors. It is important to note that the disability standards for education have the potential to make a significant difference by ensuring that all of these students can participate in education on the same basis as students who do not have special needs or disabilities.</para><para>With regard to Australian government support for the education of students with disabilities, I believe it is important to place on the record the excellent work that has been carried on by this government, not just in the current parliament but also previously, and to place on the record what has been achieved. Perhaps towards the end of my remarks I will identify some areas where more work is required. While, as we know, the primary responsibility for the provision of education and training rests with providers—and the Australian government is of course not a provider of education and training—the government does provide substantial assistance to state and territory and also non-government education and training authorities. This happens throughout the education sectors and, importantly, includes students with special needs and disabilities. </para><para>In the school sector the Australian government's financial assistance to the states and territories is significant. It is designed to improve the educational outcomes of all students, including those with disabilities, and is largely provided through three programs. Of these, the general recurrent grants program is the main source of Australian government funding and we have heard much about this, particularly towards the end of last year when the bill was passed, with an estimated $20.1 billion being provided to Australian schools in the 2001-04 quadrennium.</para><para>The Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes program, or SAISO, is the Australian government's major targeted funding program to improve the learning outcomes of educationally disadvantaged students in government and non-government schools. This is particularly the case in literacy and numeracy and for students with disabilities. Passed by parliament on 13 December last year was the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004. As we have heard, this will deliver a record $33 billion package of funding for Australian schools in the next quadrennium, 2005-08. This funding includes an estimated $2.1 billion for a new, overarching targeted program, the Literacy, Numeracy and Special Learning Needs Program, which will be targeted at the most educationally disadvantaged students, including those with disabilities.</para><para>In the vocational education and training sector, the Australian government has provided $1.15 billion to the states for VET in 2004. Under the national VET arrangements, responsibility for both public and private training systems lies with the states and territories. However, the Australian government has significantly increased VET funding for people with a disability, under its Australians Working Together welfare reform package, with an additional $9 million being available in 2004 for more training places and learning supports for people with disabilities. This will grow to over $11 million in 2005 and to more than $22 million in 2006, once the Senate passes legislation associated with this government's welfare reform package. The focus of activity in Bridging Pathways, a blueprint for improving opportunities for people with a disability, agreed to by state and territory ministers for training in June 2000, has been to improve the VET system's capacity to respond to the needs of people with a disability, including ensuring that resources and supports are available at the point of delivery.</para><para>In the higher education sector, universities are expected to provide the infrastructure and support that is necessary to ensure the best and the most effective participation for all their students—again, including those with a disability. In 2005, the Australian government will provide funds under the Commonwealth grants scheme of almost $3 billion for the provision of Commonwealth supported university places. As part of the Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future reforms, from 2005 the higher education disability support program will strengthen the focus of disability support in Australian higher education providers and increase that funding to over $6.5 million. This program consists of three parts. First, there is additional support for students with disabilities, which provides funding support to higher education providers to assist with the high costs that can be incurred in providing support and equipment to students with disabilities. The second part is the regional disability liaison officers, who will help to facilitate the transition from school to VET or higher education and then, hopefully, on to employment. The third part will be performance based disability funding support, which encourages higher education providers to implement strategies to attract and support schools with students with disabilities. </para><para>As I was waiting for my turn to speak just now I was listening to the remarks being made by the member for Forde about the level of support being provided to students across the sectors by the Queensland government. I had a great sense of deja vu as I reminisced about my years as a teacher in the state school education system in Tasmania. It was very disappointing to hear that it is happening in other states also. But, that being no surprise, this morning as I was talking with a Labor colleague on, I suppose, a collegial basis, they remarked that, even though they were in the same party as all of the state governments around Australia, despite that sense of camaraderie it was so difficult to get their state counterparts to pull their weight.</para><para>In closing, I would like to bring to the attention of the House the situation in Tasmania. Tasmania has a policy for students with disabilities which, I think, is complimented around Australia—that is, the policy of inclusion. Without going into the ideological arguments for or against inclusion—I am not about to do that today—it is important to note that inclusion has been sold to the community, and even to parents, as providing a choice for children. That choice is said to be between going to a special school—or, if you like, a specialist school for students with a disability or special needs—and going to a mainstream school. That choice is very important. It should not be lost on those of us in parliament or in the community who are not necessarily parents or, indeed, parents of children with special needs that it is in fact not the politicians, the teachers or the principals who care most about the students concerned—it is the parents. They, after all, are the ones who brought the children into the world. Undisputedly, they are the ones who love the children and have their welfare at heart the most. Hence, the choice is so important. I would argue that the implementation of the inclusion policy in Tasmania has utterly removed that choice.</para><para>I witnessed students come into my classroom, say, in grade 8 of high school, having come from a specialist school, and they struggled. They found it difficult. In my own extended family, I have a similar story where the child and parents were put under great pressure by the educational authority to move the child from a specialist school, where the classes were small, the teaching assistance was intensive and where the care factor was so very high. The school had teachers specially trained just for the purpose of teaching children with a disability. That is not to say it was easy, but it was a specialist environment and a very nurturing place for the child. They were pressured to go to what we shall call a regular mainstream school, such as mine.</para><para>That being the case, and being the case with many different students, it has had a great result in changing the profile of each of the two school sectors. This has meant a reduced resource base available to special schools. By continuing to put pressure on parents and students to move from specialist schools into mainstream schools there was, of course, an impact on the funding arrangements for each school concerned. The specialist schools had fewer students, therefore they received less funding support, less teacher allocation and less resourcing in terms of programs available to the students who were left. It also allowed the government to argue later that there was reduced demand in these specialist schools. That is the great hypocrisy of what happened. First arguing that there was a reduced demand on these schools, they then made a case that some of these schools should be closed down. Over time, the choice available to parents, even for that small community of parents and students, was diminishing and being eroded by the day. That has made me extremely angry. I think it has made a lot of parents in Tasmania very angry. </para><para>It breaks my heart to hear that it is happening all around Australia, because of state governments who are negligent, who do not seem to care about the students given to their care and who I think are showing a great disregard. It breaks my heart because I see that schools in my electorate—like St Michael's school and like St George's school—are being treated like cannon fodder for education authorities who do not want to spend the money. They do not seem to want to appreciate—just because they have a nice, cushy life on a politician's salary—that other parents and students find it more difficult and that their needs are just as important. I think that is a great tragedy.</para><para>I welcome the amendments to the Disability Discrimination Act in that they again reinforce that notion of choice and real support being given to students who need it. I think that if we do not know someone ourselves or if we do not have someone in our own family who suffers from a disability or who has a special need, we forget sometimes in this place what it must be like. I do not think we do appreciate what it could be like to live with that day by day. Of course the school day is just a small fraction of the time of a child's life, most of it being in the care of their parents. I would today call upon all state and territory governments to rededicate themselves to providing real choices to parents, to providing real support to students who need it and to providing a real future for these students.</para><para>I made the comment earlier in my contribution that really the goal of every parent is to see their child achieve their potential. Today I do not propose to know exactly how to measure that for each child. We are all different and our children are all different. I just argue that parents, being the ones who love their children the most, ought to be given more flexibility and more support. I think that there would be nobody in this place who would disagree with the basic tenets upon which I have based my argument. I call upon the state government to review the level of funding support and structural support available to this very important sector of the educational program in Tasmania.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>63</page.no><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PYNE</name><name.id>9V5</name.id><electorate>Sturt</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker McMullan. I have not seen you in this role before, so I welcome you to the chair. I would like to thank the members of this House who have taken part in the debate on the <inline ref="R2209">Disability Discrimination Amendment (Education Standards) Bill 2004</inline>, particularly the member for Gellibrand and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Importantly, for the heartfelt and intelligent contributions on our side of the House I thank the new members for Kingston and Bass and the member for Forde. I thank them for the role that they played in the debate.</para></talk.start><para>The Disability Discrimination Act 1992 provides that the Attorney-General may formulate disability standards in a range of areas, including the education of persons with disabilities. There are already disability standards governing accessible public transport. These came into effect in October 2002. It is clear that the transport standards have already benefited people with a range of disabilities, as well as other members of the public, including the elderly and parents with prams. Draft standards for access to premises were also released for public consultation in 2004. Under section 31(2) of the Disability Discrimination Act, disability standards formulated by the Attorney-General must be tabled in parliament. Once they are in effect it is unlawful to contravene a disability standard. The purpose of disability standards is to clarify and elaborate the obligations imposed by the Disability Discrimination Act. </para><para>The draft disability standards for education have been developed over many years. Their development has involved extensive consultation with government and non-government education providers, the disability sector and other interested members of the public. In June 2004 the government released for public information a draft of the standards, along with accompanying guidance notes to assist in their interpretation. The draft of the standards differs from the operation of the act in minor ways, so it was necessary to make these amendments to the act to ensure that the standards are properly supported.</para><para>In particular, this bill will amend the Disability Discrimination Act to introduce and define the term `education provider'; provide that it is unlawful for education providers to discriminate on the ground of disability in the development or accreditation of curricula or training courses; extend the defence of unjustifiable hardship in education to post-enrolment situations; clarify that disability standards may require reasonable adjustments to be made in order to avoid unlawful discrimination on the ground of disability; provide that education providers may be required to develop strategies and programs to prevent the harassment and victimisation of students with disabilities; and clarify that education providers may not be excused from complying with a standard of education on issues relating to programs that prevent harassment or victimisation on the ground of unjustifiable hardship. When implemented, the draft disability standards for education will specify how education and training are to be made more accessible to students and prospective students with disabilities, without imposing unduly onerous burdens on education providers. They will clearly describe the obligations of education providers in relation to students with disabilities, and provide guidance on how to meet those obligations.</para><para>This bill was referred for inquiry and report to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The Senate committee reported on 8 December 2004. A majority of the committee recommended the bill be passed without amendment and urged the government to introduce the final education standards into parliament as soon as practicable after the passage of the bill. The bill was then passed by the Senate without amendment. The support for the passage of the bill has been very positive, and we thank the Senate.</para><para>There have been a few issues raised in the debate by the member for Gellibrand and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The first of those has been the costs of implementation of disability standards for education, which I would like to deal with. The standards and the amendments to the Disability Discrimination Act make it clear that education providers will not be required to make adjustments for students with disabilities if those adjustments would cause them unjustifiable hardship. As the regulation impact statement shows, there should be no, or very minimal, additional costs incurred in implementing the education standards if providers are already meeting their obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act. </para><para>The government already provides substantial assistance to the states and territories and non-government education and training authorities in all education sectors, including for students with disabilities. The funding includes an estimated $2.1 billion for a new overarching program of literacy, numeracy and special learning needs to be targeted at the most educationally disadvantaged students. I very strongly support this. My father was the founding vice-president of SPELD in South Australia. SPELD is the specific education learning difficulties non-government organisation, which was established by my father in South Australia and around the country in 1975 or 1976 because one of his children suffered from dyslexia. I digress momentarily. My father was made father of the year for South Australia in 1975 because of his work with SPELD and specific learning difficulties. I very strongly support the role of the government in providing that money and support for people with learning difficulties.</para><para>Another issue that the member for Gellibrand and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition raised was the possible undesirable consequences of extending the defence of unjustifiable hardship. The government is keen to ensure that, when they are formulated, the disability standards for education reflect an appropriate balance between the interests of a student or a prospective student with a disability and the effects on the education provider of making an adjustment to accommodate the student. At the moment, it is only possible for an education provider to claim unjustifiable hardship at the point of enrolment of a student with a disability. The amendment in this bill to extend the defence of unjustifiable hardship beyond the point of enrolment will avoid the undesirable effect of discouraging educational institutions from admitting students with disabilities because they are concerned about the potential future costs of accommodating the student. The experience has been that some educational institutions refuse enrolment on the basis of potential concerns about disability when, if they could enrol students and see how they go, the institution may find they did not have any difficulties that would have precluded their being enrolled in the first place. This is an important step.</para><para>This bill will clear the way for draft disability standards for education, which have been the product of extensive consultation with industry, government and disability sector representatives. The standards are a practical way of clarifying the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act. They will provide certainty for education providers about their obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act, and they will clarify the rights of people with disabilities with respect to education and training. There is no doubt that one of the key issues that members of parliament deal with that is heartfelt and heart-rending for all of us is the difficulties that people with disabilities face that those of us without a disability have not had to face. I was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services for 12 months, and I listened to many very difficult and challenging stories from parents who are trying to help their children have as normal lives as possible.

Yesterday when I was speaking I was interrupted by the adjournment. Yesterday in the Main Committee I was talking about the outstanding work carried out by the University of the Sunshine Coast and the tremendous progress that that institution has made since it was established in 1994. The member for Fairfax and I went to see the then education minister, Dr Kemp, with a view to allowing the university to become a fully independent institution. This occurred in 1999, when the university changed its name to the University of the Sunshine Coast. Since that time, it has gone from strength to strength. The current Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, has been to the university. He has spoken with the key stakeholders at the university, and I have to say that the university owes him a very great debt because of the strong support that he has given to the University of the Sunshine Coast.</para></talk.start><para>I pointed out in the Main Committee yesterday that, between now and 2008, the University of the Sunshine Coast has been allocated 1,080 new places out of a total of 6,500 new places allocated to the state of Queensland. In fact, 395 new places have been made available for this academic year. Of the 1,080 new places, 328 will go to secondary teaching. Other disciplines to receive substantial increases in places include business, 205 new places; enabling sciences, 137 new places; human movement, 150 new places; and human welfare, 96 new places. New places will also go to nursing, health promotion and communication media studies.</para><para>These new places have been allocated to a wide number of disciplines, which is a great thing. This means that the university will be able to offer a wide range of courses and will become a much more attractive place for students to attend as students will be able to study a wide range of subjects in a wide range of degree courses. The breadth of disciplines is indicative of the university's innovative approach and the Howard government's support for students' learning across all disciplines. </para><para>Part of the university's success lies with the very high calibre of staff employed by the university, which ranks No. 1 among all Queensland universities and fifth among all Australian universities in proportion to full-time academic staff with PhDs and higher degrees. This extremely high level of professionalism is reflected in the documented graduate satisfaction rate of 92 per cent from students' university experience. I have met many of the students from the university, and I am impressed with the calibre of person the university is releasing into the community to perform worthwhile work on behalf of their fellow community members. I am personally proud of this institution. It is a university that will go from strength to strength, and it is a university we can all admire.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>67</page.no><name role="metadata">Elliot, Justine, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs ELLIOT</name><name.id>DZW</name.id><electorate>Richmond</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is a crisis in aged care and the <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline> does nothing to rectify it. After nine years of underfunding and neglect, the government remains complacent about fixing the problems. Red tape, a funding shortage, a lack of facilities and staff, and differing standards of care are always issues that come up when people speak to me about aged care. Nowhere are the problems more obvious than in the electorate of Richmond. One in four people living in Richmond is over 65 and thousands of people retire to the electorate every year. They come to Richmond looking for a better lifestyle. We can certainly offer them that—beautiful beaches and a relaxed and friendly environment. Unfortunately, they also often find a lack of infrastructure and underfunded aged care facilities that are unable to meet their needs. That is what nine years of neglect by the government has given them. The government had simply failed to put resources where they are most needed—in areas like the North Coast of New South Wales. If our elderly want to retain their independence, they find that they are unable to access some basic assistance to help them stay in their homes.</para></talk.start><para>Our older Australians have made a tremendous contribution to our society. It shows a total lack of respect from this government that our seniors are not being cared for properly. The government has taken the support of older Australians for granted. They think that this is a licence to neglect aged care in Australia. The government's record on aged care is not a good one, particularly in my electorate. Waiting lists for aged care beds in Richmond have blown out. Our hospital wards are filling up with elderly people who cannot get into an aged care bed because there is simply not one available. There is a six- to seven-month waiting list for CAPS packages that provide vital home care—home care that allows our local elderly to maintain their independence.</para><para>In 1990 there were 250 referrals to CAPS across my electorate. By 2004 there were 1,800 referrals. In January alone this year, there were 190 referrals. The government is failing to keep up with this level of demand. Locally, we received just 180 CAPS packages, which provide seven hours a week home care. That is one-tenth of the referrals. It is obvious to me and my community where the demand lies, yet the government has failed to act on its responsibility to older Australians. That is why I have decided to hold a local aged care summit. The summit will bring together local aged care and health experts as well as elderly residents of Richmond. I want to hear from them about the aged care needs of my local community and I want to work with them to find solutions to the current problems facing the aged care sector in my local community. That is also why I fought so hard to get on this parliament's health and ageing committee. It is important to elderly people in my electorate and their families that the government is held accountable for the decisions they make regarding aged care. </para><para>The government have become so complacent on aged care that they have failed to provide the necessary funding. I would be happy for the Minister for Ageing to come to Richmond to see the need for herself. She could visit any one of the nursing homes in my electorate and see first-hand the problems in aged care. They could tell her about the number of people who are waiting to get into an aged care bed and they could tell her about their staffing problems and the problems they have with red tape—the time they spend away from caring for residents, filling in paperwork. I am happy to work with anyone—across party lines and at all levels of government—so that elderly people in Richmond are well cared for. In my view, this is an issue above politics. It is about care and respect for the senior citizens who have contributed so much to our community.</para><para>Just last week the National Aged Care Alliance, the peak representative body of the aged care industry, released a paper urging the government to address the funding problems in aged care. The alliance is made up of health professionals, the elderly, unions and aged care providers. These are the aged care experts. If the minister ignores their recommendations, she is ignoring the problems faced in the aged care sector. The alliance has compiled a list of major problems that the government needs to address, including insufficient funding, a failure to provide for older Australians with special needs and proper training for staff. I was encouraged to see that the shadow minister for aged care has taken on board their recommendations and will continue to consider them closely.</para><para>I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the staff of my local aged care facilities. Over the past two years I have had the opportunity to visit several of my local nursing homes. During every visit I meet dedicated and caring staff who work hard to provide for our seniors. Unfortunately, the government ties them up in red tape. Instead of caring for our elderly, they are forced to spend their time bogged down in paperwork. Professor Warren Hogan, author of a $7.2 million government report into aged care, agrees. He thinks that there needs to be a complete overhaul of aged care legislation. Let us hope that the $7.2 million the government has spent on this report does not go to waste. My fear is that Professor Hogan's report will gather dust on a shelf in the minister's office. I urge the Minister for Ageing to look carefully at Professor Hogan's report—a report she herself called:</para><quote><para>One of the most expansive and detailed reviews of residential aged care ever produced.</para></quote><para>I know that the message from my community to the minister is: act on this report immediately and make the changes that the Hogan report recommended. Instead of ignoring the experts, it is time the minister listened to what they and the community are saying. The time to fix our aged care system is now. Older Australians deserve the very best care available.</para><para>The government's complacency over the past nine years has left the aged care system in an absolute shambles. I will always support sensible proposals to improve quality, affordability and access to aged care. I am always willing to work with anyone to get a better deal for seniors in Richmond and I will continue to push the minister to fix the problems created over the past nine years—problems created because the government has simply ignored the needs of older Australians. </para><para>The lack of aged care beds and suitable home care arrangements for our elderly creates problems in the wider community. I know of many cases of elderly people who are forced to stay in hospital because there is no aged care bed available. Some are going to the emergency ward because they cannot afford to see their GP. That is why I secured a commitment from the Minister for Health and Ageing for an after-hours GP clinic for Tweed. I understand that tenders have been called for. That is positive news for Tweed families.</para><para>Tweed Hospital has the second busiest emergency ward in New South Wales outside of Sydney. Our community—from the elderly to young families—relies on Tweed's emergency department. The government's changes to bulk-billing have meant that it is harder than ever to find a bulk-billing doctor. This means that people are forced into the emergency department of the local hospital, particularly in the case of elderly people on fixed incomes. Some simply cannot afford to get sick. That is why an after-hours clinic is so important; it will provide a bulk-billing doctor to take the pressure off our local emergency ward.</para><para>Another major concern of elderly people in my electorate is this government's decision to cut the Commonwealth dental scheme. The minister for health himself has said in relation to Labor's dental health scheme, and I quote:</para><quote><para>The Keating government's program did reduce waiting times, no doubt about that ...</para></quote><para>If he agrees that this system worked, why doesn't he restore the funding to public dental health his government tore out nine years ago? There are only about 240 public dentists to cater for more than 2.5 million health care card holders, children and the elderly. This compares with more than 3,000 private dentists to treat the rest of the population. I have met many elderly people who were unable to eat solid foods because their teeth were so bad and they were unable to see a dentist. The government cannot wash their hands of this crisis. Providing public dental care is an obligation that this government have failed to meet.</para><para>I agree with the member for Moncrieff, who said on Monday that our public dental scheme was third world. I agree because I have seen first-hand elderly people in pain and waiting for a dentist. In Australia in 2005 this should not happen. Again, it shows a complete lack of respect and a disregard for the needs of elderly Australians. Public dentists are doing everything they can; they just are not getting the support they need from this government. It seems that the Prime Minster and the minister for health are content to leave elderly Australians with severe dental problems to suffer. They are not training enough dentists to meet the demand and they are not providing the support that public dentists need to meet the demands of their patients. This is not something that the government should be allowed to ignore. Public dentists provide an invaluable service to our community. This government have an obligation to meet the dental health needs of our community. They are simply not meeting that obligation.</para><para>The care of veterans in our community is also an important issue in my electorate. A number of veterans have contacted me recently concerned about the indexation of payments for veterans who are totally or partially incapacitated. This is an important issue for all veterans who served in the world wars, Vietnam or in more recent campaigns. I am particularly concerned about this issue because a number of veterans who live in my electorate are being unfairly treated. The issue arises because the TPI payment is indexed only partially to male average weekly earnings. Other pensions and payments are indexed fully. This means that people receiving an aged pension or unemployment benefits are, in a sense, better off than our veterans </para><para>The Prime Minister and Minister for Veterans' Affairs never miss an opportunity to talk about their respect for veterans and the contribution they have made to our country. But, as the saying goes, actions speak louder than words. These veterans were injured so badly defending our nation that they can no longer work. It is only right and fair that the government provide adequately for them. The government's refusal to index these payments fairly means that the livelihoods of these veterans are slowly eroding. The federal government's bandaid solution of partial indexation has slowed the erosion, but it will not stop it completely. These men and women served our nation with distinction. The federal government's blatant disregard of the needs of veterans is absolutely appalling. Our veterans deserve better from the federal government. They do not expect any more than what is fair; and that is precisely what they should get. I call on the Prime Minister and veterans' affairs minister to act immediately to rectify this gross injustice.</para><para>Our elderly Australians deserve to be taken care of properly. The contribution they have made to our community is one we should all be grateful for. We can show that gratitude by taking care of them well. This government has taken elderly Australians for granted for far too long. This issue is about showing a basic level of respect for the contributions of elderly Australians—and the government should be working to find solutions to these problems instead of just watching from the sidelines.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>70</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to speak on the <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline>. In the five minutes afforded to me this afternoon prior to question time, I would like to focus on the issue of roads in the electorate of Paterson. I was awoken this morning by one of my media outlets that informed me that last night there was, yet again, a serious smash on the Tea Gardens turn-off on the Pacific Highway. Work is under way now—thanks to the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Mr Lloyd, who provided support and assistance—to upgrade the Pacific Highway between Karuah and the Viney Creek turn-off. One of the key issues in the development of this road, planned for by the New South Wales state government, is that there has been absolutely no allowance for a flyover.</para></talk.start><para>The accident occurred last night simply because a vehicle had to go across the oncoming traffic, which was only doing 90 kilometres an hour. There was a collision and a person is now in a serious condition in hospital. As this road is upgraded we are going to see vehicles travelling past this intersection at 110 kilometres an hour. If a car is travelling with a caravan attached—because the Hawks Nest-Tea Gardens area is an extremely popular tourist destination—canvassing a vehicle with a caravan on the back in front of vehicles doing 110 an hour defies any logical stance on safety. I will be writing to Mr Costa this week urging him, as the new roads minister in New South Wales, to have a look at this intersection. Communities in my electorate such as North Arm Cove, Tea Gardens and Hawks Nest are up in arms at the state of the planning for this road.</para><para>Prior to the election, I had Minister Lloyd up to see the commencement of works at Nabiac. That is a section of road from Bundacree Creek right through to Nabiac. There is supposed to be a community consultative group for issues pertaining to these roadworks. The state government has established these community consultative groups in name only because each and every time these community groups go to meet with the RTA they meet a stonewall approach. I believe it is time that the planners and developers who look at this road infrastructure in New South Wales, the RTA, take into serious consideration the accident rates that occur when you do not have a flyover in place. Every time I hear of an accident or a fatality on these roads in my electorate it drives straight through me because I can feel the pain of those who are left behind and suffering. I urge the state government in New South Wales to seriously reconsider the planning approach that it takes to the upgrading of the highway, and in particular the approach it takes to flyovers in the region. </para><para>We were very fortunate during the election that the Prime Minister decided to invest an additional $10 million in roadworks in Paterson. This road work will include the works between Dungog and Raymond Terrace and an area on Lakes Way near the Seal Rocks turn-off. We were caught out by the state government in the 2001 election when we committed $20 million to the Bucketts Way. We expected that the New South Wales Labor government would do the honourable thing and match the $20 million that we were investing on a state road. They did not. So the $10 million that we have committed to these roads in the Paterson shire has a riding clause that it must be matched by the New South Wales government. We will wait and see whether they treat roadworks and motorists' safety as a priority.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

The National Water Initiative is the greatest single initiative to address the problem of water shortage in our country for generations. I welcome the fact that at last we have an expression of commitment to that initiative from a political leader from Western Australia because, when the initiative was signed, the Premier of Western Australia, Dr Gallop, held out and thereby denied to the farmers of Western Australia the opportunity to participate. The Leader of the Opposition asks me specifically why a provision relating to full cost recovery was included. I would, in addition to what I am about to say, examine the papers relating to that decision to see if there were further things, but I would have thought, if we are to have any kind of hope of dealing with the problem of water shortages in this country, we have got to in the future send more accurate market signals. </para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Kyoto Protocol</title><page.no>72</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>72</page.no><name role="metadata">Turnbull, Malcolm, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TURNBULL</name><name.id>885</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

I know he and most members—probably all members—of this House share the view that climate change is an issue that has to be addressed. The international community needs to address this issue. But it is the view of this government that the problem with the Kyoto protocol is that it does not address the problem. If you actually look at what the Kyoto protocol is intended to achieve, it is intended to reduce global emissions by just one per cent below what they would have otherwise been within the target period. In other words, emissions will still be some 40 per cent higher in 2010 than they would have been in 1990. I think, if the public and the international community were aware of this, they would be less enthusiastic about Kyoto. The international community is right: the issue of climate change must be addressed. But Kyoto is not addressing it.</para></talk.start><para>The Kyoto protocol has set targets—but how are countries going in meeting those targets? Of the countries with targets, at the moment the current projection is that Canada will be 25 per cent above its target. Yes, it has ratified the Kyoto protocol, but it will be 25 per cent above its Kyoto target. Japan will be 13 per cent above it; Denmark, a member of the European Union, will be 38 per cent above its Kyoto target; and Ireland, 27 per cent. If you take all 25 countries in the European Union at the moment, the projection is that they will be some eight per cent overshooting their target.</para><para>The point here is: if the Kyoto protocol is such a great idea, why is it doing nothing to address climate change? Our answer to that is that in this country we are spending $1.8 billion to address this issue and we are on target—we are on, if you like, our Kyoto target. So, whilst we do not believe in the Kyoto process for very good reason, because the Kyoto process is not working and is not workable, nevertheless we are able to make a substantial contribution ourselves to addressing this issue. It is the view of this government that the international community needs to get together and work through ideas which will seriously address this problem, not resort to the sort of stuntsmanship that we have seen from the opposition on this issue over the last few days, and ensure that the international community is driven more by substantial policy outcomes than the mere symbolism which is all that Kyoto amounts to.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economy: Interest Rates</title><page.no>73</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>73</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

Without in any way denigrating the contribution of those Australians who live in Western Australia, let me say that the strength of the Western Australian economy—which is undoubted—is due overwhelmingly to the economic policies of the coalition government, just as the strength of the Queensland economy, the strength of the New South Wales economy, the strength of the South Australian economy and the strength of the Tasmanian economy are.</para><para>The message that I would like to convey is that Western Australia could be doing even better if it had a state government that followed policies that were more supportive of the national government in a number of important areas. Let us take the very important area of industrial relations. The rate of working days lost in Western Australia due to industrial disputes has trebled since the year 2001. By June 2004 Western Australia's rate of 121 working days lost per thousand employees was almost twice the national average of 67. It is right to say, as Western Australian premiers of both political complexions have said to me over the years, that Western Australia may have only 11 per cent of the population but it contributes 28 per cent of the export income of the nation. It is also fair to say that there is no reason that Western Australia cannot have an industrial record the equal of the national average and the equal of the best that is achieved around Australia. That can happen if Western Australia has a change of state government.</para><para>Let me say of the alternative Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett, whom I know well, that he is rightly making an issue in this campaign of taking decisions and not dithering about decisions being taken by government because, as minister for resources and energies in the 1990s, for example, he was the driving force behind the Dampier to Perth gas pipeline. I know that that is an example of the kind of focus that he will be able to bring to the government of that wonderful state if he is elected Premier on 26 February.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>74</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>74</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon His Excellency Mr Gran Persson, Prime Minister of Sweden, accompanied by Her Excellency Mrs Karin Ehnbom-Palmquist, the Swedish Ambassador.

Let me address the issue of debt. I think we are all aware that at various stages in our existence, whether as a nation, as individuals or as companies, we have debt. The question of the size of that debt and the manageability of that debt is determined by our capacity to service that debt. One of the products of the sparkling performance of the Australian economy over the last few years is that our capacity to service foreign debt has increased dramatically. One of the reasons that our capacity has increased spectacularly is the volume of government debt. Bear in mind that the foreign debt, which the Leader of the Opposition is undoubtedly alluding to, is of course largely the debt of individuals and corporations. </para></talk.start><para>The government itself has made a tremendous contribution towards reducing the government's contribution to debt. In fact, at 3.9 per cent of GDP, name me a developed country in the world that has a lower proportion to GDP of government debt than Australia. The OECD average is about 45 to 50 per cent; in the United States it is about 45 per cent; in Japan I think it is over 100 per cent; and ours is 3.9 per cent. That is due to the fact that when the government came to office and inherited a budget deficit of $10½ billion from the Leader of the Opposition, who was the outgoing finance minister, this government, despite the attempts of the Labor Party and others in the Senate to frustrate its budget reduction program, set about not only getting rid of that $10½ billion but also accumulating surpluses and paying off debt. That is one of the reasons why this country is in such a strong economic position. I warmly thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indigenous Affairs: Health</title><page.no>76</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>76</page.no><name role="metadata">Tollner, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TOLLNER</name><name.id>00AN4</name.id><electorate>Solomon</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing.

In 1998 the Commonwealth introduced a special scheme to substitute aviation fuel for normal petrol in remote Indigenous communities to help combat the problem of petrol sniffing. Because aviation fuel did not contain aromatic hydrocarbons, it was not attractive to sniffers. But as a result of environmental changes avgas has now become unleaded. It will contain aromatic hydrocarbons and therefore it is no longer an effective substitute for use in communities which are prone to petrol sniffing.</para></talk.start><para>I am very pleased to say that BP Australia has now developed a special type of unleaded fuel without any aromatic hydrocarbons, specially designed for use in remote Indigenous communities. I am pleased to say that, thanks to this, the government will continue to spend $1 million a year supplying unsniffable fuel to remote communities where petrol sniffing is a potential problem. Because of this, the government will be able to continue to work with community leaders in the fight against petrol sniffing. It is a very important fight. This has claimed 100 Indigenous lives since 1981.

I do stand by my minister and I think he has been unfairly, wrongly and quite disgracefully criticised by the opposition on this issue.</para><para>Let us get to the essence of this issue. The essence of this issue is that at no stage last year when we were talking about Abu Ghraib was there any evidence of substance—any evidence at all—that Australians had been involved in prisoner abuse. The whole exercise last year was designed, however indirectly, to create a different impression. The Leader of the Opposition knows this and those who sit on the front bench know this.

They are getting sick and tired of it.</para><para>Obviously it is impossible for the defence minister or the Prime Minister, whether you have a Labor government or a Liberal government, to know the minutiae of everything that takes place in a theatre of conflict. We have to rely on the information that is provided to us by the defence department. I think the Defence people have done their level best to provide accurate information to the Senate, accurate information to ministers and accurate information to me. There is a difference between interrogation and interview. That is clearly spelled out in the military manual. It is understood by Lieutenant Colonel James. It is understood by the military officers who gave evidence to the Senate estimates committee yesterday. It ought to be understood by the Leader of the Opposition, who is a former defence minister, and it should now be understood by the member for Barton.</para><para>This exercise we have had over the past few days has been a nitpicking attempt to damage the political reputation of the Minister for Defence.

A significant proportion of that was our coal exports, leading the way with growth in value. They grew by 24 per cent in 2004. This certainly is a remarkable performance as far as the resources sector is concerned.

A lot of that is going to be going into improvements in infrastructure across Australia in terms of getting those exports from their source out of the country to our export markets. Along with what our government is doing, particularly through programs like AusLink where we are set to invest $12½ billion over five years in Australia's road and rail infrastructure, it is all going towards developing the logistical supply chain to match the needs in the marketplace and the ability of our exports sector to deliver to those needs in the marketplace.</para><para>You might ask what the state governments across Australia are doing. What are the states doing, the people that control a lot of the export ports across Australia? We know what the Queensland state government is not doing. They are not investing in infrastructure, but they are collecting massive amounts of royalties from our resources sector. The Queensland government has forecast that it will receive around $800 million in royalties in 2004-05 from our resources exports. It is also forecast that that may even go through the billion dollar mark being collected by the Queensland government. Yet they will not invest any money back into the much needed infrastructure to accommodate the growth in the export of resources out of that state. They will not even fund a 70-kilometre rail link, worth around $100 million, to Abbott Point, which would immediately alleviate the bottleneck that currently exists at Dalrymple Bay, an issue that the Treasurer spoke about yesterday.</para><para>One of the local mayors in Queensland, the Mayor of Bowen, who wants to see this investment take place, said about the Queensland government: `It is just a matter of someone pulling their finger out and getting on with it.' We agree with him. The Queensland government should get on with investing in assets that will help our exporters get their product out, instead of living off the infrastructure that was invested by previous Queensland governments, particularly the Bjelke-Petersen government, over the last 30 years. They should stop loafing on that, join the Australian government and industry and invest in what we need to enhance our export infrastructure for the future. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>79</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>79</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister and follows his answer to the previous question from the honourable member for Barton.

The Australian military forces do not accept that and Neil James, who is the original author of the ADF interrogation manual, does not accept that either.

They have used a highly technical definition. Even on the basis of that highly technical definition there was unquestionably interrogation.</para></quote><para>That is the view of the member for Barton and he may hold that view and he is entitled to hold that view. But what I am putting in all seriousness to the opposition is that that is not the view of the Australian military. It is not the view of the head of the Defence Association. It was not the view of the head of military operations in Iraq who commissioned the circumstances under which people would participate in the Iraq Survey Group, and it was clearly not the view of the defence department when they provided advice to both the defence minister and to me last year. This all arises out of an attempt by the opposition to allege that in some way the defence minister and I and others in the government have misled the parliament and the Australian public.</para><para>We have done no such thing. At all stages in relation to this we have been absolutely candid. The people who are trying to distort the language, with great respect, are those who are speaking for the opposition, because they are refusing to accept what I do and what I believe most people who have examined it will do: that in the military context there is a clear distinction between an interview and an interrogation. It is spelt out in an Australian Army manual. So if it was meaningless and if we were just playing with words, why would it be spelt out in an Australian Army manual? </para><para>I say again: we have the head of the Defence Association, a former intelligence officer, who has said it very clearly. And I make no comments about Mr Barton—he is entitled to his view—but the reality is that when he signed the questionnaire that was sent out last year, the word he used was `interview'. He is a person who quintessentially was in a much better position to know the difference between `interrogation' and `interview' than I was, or the Leader of the Opposition or indeed anybody else, because he in fact had been commissioned as part of the Iraq Survey Group and he understood the terms of that commission and the terms of that engagement. He used the word `interview' when he answered the question last year. He did not use `interrogation'; he used `interview'. I suggest he did that because he then understood very clearly the distinction that existed between the two concepts, as Lieutenant Colonel James understands it, as Barton's commanding officer understands it and as I know the Leader of the Opposition understands it. Anybody who has studied the manual will understand the difference. There is a difference in Australian military parlance between the two concepts. And when that is understood, any suggestion that Senator Hill has misled the Australian public on this issue is completely false.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: School Standards</title><page.no>80</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>80</page.no><name role="metadata">Draper, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DRAPER</name><name.id>0L6</name.id><electorate>Makin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training.

One of the many initiatives announced by the government during the recent election campaign was that we will move to develop and establish an Australian certificate of education which could be undertaken by students across Australia as an alternative to the conventional year 12 examinations conducted in eight different jurisdictions.</para></talk.start><para>I will shortly be calling for tenders for appropriate organisations to develop the model, which would be based on four things. The first is that we can drive consistency amongst the eight different jurisdictions at the moment in terms of year 12 assessment and make sure that we have a common test across Australia. Alternatively, the Australian certificate of education could be based on a national curriculum based assessment. Thirdly, it could take the form of a student aptitude test, which is currently applied quite successfully across the United States of America. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the Australian certificate of education could be based on the template of the international baccalaureate, which is currently being undertaken by 20,000 Australian students throughout schools because, increasingly, parents and teachers and students are frustrated and looking for a nationally and internationally recognised and consistent qualification.</para><para>No sooner had I announced the detail in relation to this than the Deputy Leader of the Opposition issued a media release on 7 February this year which described this move for national consistency and the certificate of education in the following terms: absurd, meaningless, nonsense, bureaucratic nightmare—and so on it goes. So obviously at least the Labor Party is consistent in criticising anything which drives national consistency and high quality in standards. Then I thought, no, not everybody in the Labor Party could think that way. Then I recalled that, slipped among my Christmas cards on Christmas Eve, was a letter that I had received from one of the Labor MPs. This one, rather than being the typical one you get from the Labor backbench wilderness, was indeed from the front bench. </para><para>The letter read in part: `Dear Minister, I write on behalf of a certain school located in my electorate. The school is interested in offering the international baccalaureate course to interested students. Indeed the school is collaborating with two other schools on the development of an international baccalaureate pilot program. Currently, government schools in Victoria are not allowed to offer such a course. However, in order to pilot the international baccalaureate some funding would be required. I would be grateful for your indication as to whether such a program would be considered for funding under the Howard government's Investing in our Schools program.' That, as the Prime Minister knows, is the $1 billion that this government is investing to cut through constipated educational bureaucracies to support things that are desperately needed at the school level. The letter goes on: `I would also be grateful if you would consider allocating time when you are in Melbourne to meet with representatives with the schools who are interested in this new development in public education. I look forward to your reply.'</para><para>I am sure that Julia Gillard, member for Lalor, shadow minister for health and alternate Deputy Leader of the Opposition, will look forward to my reply. My reply is that I look forward to meeting those schools. And I ask the member for Lalor: why don't we jointly write to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and she can come along to the meeting too? It would be a lovely meeting, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition can actually listen to what parents are saying. They have had it up to here with inconsistent national standards and they are sick and tired of educational ideologues in education departments telling them what they know is not in the interests of their children.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>81</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>81</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

The report shows that the premiums for public liability insurance have fallen by 15 per cent in the six months to June 2004. This is very welcome news for the community. It means that community events that were at risk due to increased premiums will now be under less financial stress and, as a result, we have a better chance of these very important aspects of community life continuing to operate.</para></talk.start><para>The finding is also very welcome news for business and particularly small business who have to find the money for the public liability insurance premiums. These reductions will be very welcome by them. The report shows that professional indemnity insurance premiums have also fallen by 17 per cent in the six months to June 2004. This is after a number of increases in previous years. Whilst these lower premiums are welcome, the government realise there is more to be done, and we will have to monitor these prices over time to ensure they do not escalate. To that end, I have agreed that the ACCC continue to monitor prices and to make that information available in an annual report, and this will be done for next three years. The one major item of tort law reform that remains outstanding is the passing of the amendments to the Trade Practices Act which were stymied by the opposition in the Senate. We will be reintroducing that measure, and I call on the Labor Party to change their position to assist the government to keep downward pressure on insurance rates. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Regional Services: Program Funding</title><page.no>83</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>83</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Fraser</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services.

He would be interested to know that since 1996 there have been 530 new apprentices in training in his electorate, which is a 221 per cent increase. I urge the member to work hard to get an even better result over the years ahead. New apprenticeship centres, NACs—such as National Apprenticeship Services in Morphett Vale in his electorate—are contracted by the government to provide information and support, coordinate the relationships between apprentices and their employers and administer incentives for new apprenticeships. Over the last two years the number of new apprenticeship centres—an investment by this government in Australian apprenticeships—has increased from 300 to some 500 right around Australia. This year the government will spend more than $685 million on incentives paid directly to employers of new apprentices and on the provision of these support services. </para></talk.start><para>This support is absolutely essential. It is helping young people to get a start in traditional trades such as metal trades, motor trades, carpentry and plumbing. We have seen an 18 per cent increase in the number of those taking up those trades, which proves the success of the NACs. A recent survey which was commissioned by my department, to listen to people, found that employers and indeed their new apprentices are highly satisfied with the work done by the new apprenticeship centres. Nine out of every 10 employers surveyed indicated that they would use the same NAC again. In fact, 93.1 per cent said they would employ a new apprentice again in the future, which is exactly what the government wants to see Australian businesses doing. This is why the ongoing success of the government's many measures to deal with the growth of new apprentices in the Australian economy has grown training in Australia from a pitiful 141,000 apprentices in 1995 to around 400,000 today.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Regional Services: Program Funding</title><page.no>84</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>84</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name><name.id>UK6</name.id><electorate>Wills</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services.

Recently I announced 339 new programs which will help 4,000 young people across this country to provide support to their local communities. This government remains absolutely committed to the Work for the Dole program. In the member for Stirling's electorate one of those programs relates to the assistance provided to the local PCYC—helping the local police in that community to work with the children to provide support around the administration of the centre. It is a wonderful program that contributes right around the country—to the relief aid in the tsunami affected areas right across Indonesia. If the opposition remains opposed to the Work for the Dole program, why don't they dispense with the semantics and come out and say where they stand. If they are opposed to it they should scrap it as part of their policy. This government is committed to the program because it is part of the reason we have been able to bring unemployment levels down by half compared to when the opposition leader was the employment services minister.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Howard</name></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.</para></talk.start></interjection></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER</title><type>Questions to the Speaker</type><page.no>86</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Question Time</title><page.no>86</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>86</page.no><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name><name.id>YU5</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, during question time you required the honourable member for Griffith to rephrase a section of a question which sought to ask the government whether it was the government's position that a person who is not a member of this House, Mr Rod Barton, was lying.

We have opponents across the chamber from us who will say anything and do anything to get themselves elected. They will say anything, do anything, slander any reputation while in office to protect their political position. They will spend anything, under any set of conditions, and ignore any guidelines in order to secure certain amounts of money for their candidates to ensure they get elected.</para></talk.start><para>This government is unacquainted with the truth or any decent standard that would be expected of it by a public. It has abandoned truthfulness, it has abandoned good public policy and it has abandoned all proper processes. It rejects the advice of independent experts, it ignores criticism and it covers over any facts that do not fit its message. This government and the Prime Minister are obsessed with spin doctoring, with controlling every image and every story to suit their political interests, no matter what the cost. It does not matter to them if the cost is that hundreds of millions of dollars are diverted from urgently needed infrastructure into political slush funds. It does not matter to them if the cost is that they damage the reputation of dedicated public servants and service men and women. It does not matter to them if the cost is an ever-deepening public cynicism towards democratic institutions. If there is short-term political gain, the government will be in it.</para><para>Despite the government's obsession with secrecy, we sometimes find out things they do not want us to know. That has been happening through the Senate estimates process this week, a process that will be much diminished in value from the middle of this year when the government will assume absolute control of this parliament. We are seeing perhaps the last phase of the value of that institution in accountability terms in Australia, and we are going to be the poorer for it. When the facts do come out, they will paint a damning picture of a government that has contempt for integrity and openness and an obsession with spinning a message that always paints it in the most favourable light.</para><para>I want to address three issues that demonstrate the urgent need for this government to radically change its priorities and to start putting the interests of the Australian people above the interests of Liberal and National Party politicians. The first is the deliberate deception that this government has practised by promising to keep interest rates low while implementing policies that are increasing inflationary pressures and making an interest rate increase a serious possibility in the coming months by its actions. The second is the deliberate deception that this government practised last year in concealing the fact that Australian armed forces participated in the interrogation of Iraqi prisoners. The third is the deliberate deception that this government has practised by allocating hundreds of millions of dollars to spending programs that have been driven by one priority—political profit for politicians. </para><para>Let me deal with the first of those, on interest rates. All of us in this place were contestants at the last election or we would not be here. Day after day in that election campaign, we saw statement after statement by the government along the lines of that statement I quoted in question time. Here is another one:</para><quote><para>Well, we're certainly, first and foremost, we're offering a continuation of the low interest rates of the last eight and a half years.</para></quote><para>They slandered the Labor Party, which was the only political party that went into this election campaign with savings for its expenditure programs in order to reduce budgetary pressures on interest rates, through that campaign. They whipped up a fear campaign about it and they won the election. What do we find in the aftermath of that election? We find the Prime Minister here in this chamber with weasel words: `We didn't really say that. Oh, no, we didn't promise the Australian people that interest rates would not rise.' Let me tell him there are at least 10 million Australians out there who think he did, and a substantial number of them voted for him on that basis. But, no, he cites the weasel words. Every day in question time there is another exercise in hairsplitting. We heard a few of them affecting Defence personnel today, and all year we have heard the hairsplitting on the question of interest rates. But the Australian people do not believe the government and, when the government find themselves presiding over increased interest rates, they will know exactly who to blame.</para><para>The government understand this is about to happen to them, so off they go to find scapegoats. The unions are the scapegoats. We have the government's industrial relations legislation in operation. We have a quiet union movement in this country. What we have as well is a population that is not as skilled as it should be and that is creating the pressure, the glitches and the blockages in our economy now as companies that wish to invest in new developments find themselves without the work force that they need. It is not that they have an undisciplined work force; it is that they cannot get a skilled work force and blockages emerge from the infrastructure.</para><para>Yesterday, the Treasurer stood up in this place and discussed the coal loader in Queensland—very interesting. The statement he cited from the Queensland minister is about as old as the hills. It is the first time the Treasurer has managed to get up and discuss it in this place, but why did he discuss it? Because he has discovered what the opposition's infrastructure spokespersons and Treasury spokespersons have been talking about since the day they were appointed, and they have been joined by the OECD and by the Reserve Bank. One of the glitches in the economy at the moment is the manifest inattention by this government to the infrastructure needs of this nation that has been the hallmark of its rule, or its misrule, for the last nine years.</para><para>The government inherited an economy in which great changes had been made that drove it to be one of the exemplary economies in the growth of wealth of the last decade or so. There were bitter experiences for many of us who served in those governments as we took the hard decisions to make changes and we were, as a result, the targets of many of those who had suffered as those changes were made. But the rewards were all reaped in political terms by this government, and this government has trashed them. It has trashed those rewards as it has sought, every time an election has come round, to buy itself back into power. </para><para>As the Reserve Bank governor sits down and contemplates what he intends to do about the future, there is no question that one of the things he has at the back of his mind is the $66 billion that this government punched out of the budget surplus in one year flat to get itself re-elected. Did the government think that the $66 billion punched into the economy to rocket-fuel it would pass the attention of the Reserve Bank governor and that, after the election was over, he might not think about doing something about it? But what he does about it ought to be sheeted right home to our political opponents.</para><para>There is no need for interest rates to rise. They boast about interest rates, but our interest rates are about the highest in the industrialised world. On a comparative basis, we have an official rate of 5.2 per cent. It is around two per cent in the US and in Europe. The nearest rate to ours is the British, which is 4.75 per cent. The Japanese rate is 0.1 per cent. And we are talking about the possibility of a 50 basis point rise in those circumstances. Where is our international competitiveness here? What is going to happen to Australian businesses as a result of that? And it can all be sheeted back to that $66 billion punch and the other matters that I have been referring to that John Howard put out for his re-election campaign.</para><para>The icing on the cake of that $66 billion had to be that extraordinary campaign launch of his. I have seen a few rippers in my time, and the odd Labor Party leader has been responsible for one or two of them, but I have never seen money spent in a policy speech at the rate of $200 million a minute. That absolutely took the prize, that absolutely took the cake; and that was our political opponents.</para><para>Truth in government goes elsewhere as well. It can go to national security areas and to the honour with which civil servants are dealt. The Prime Minister attacked us in question time today as though we have been attacking Defence personnel. He got up and said, `What the Labor Party are trying to prove is that Australian Defence personnel were involved in torture at Abu Ghraib.' No, that is not it. We are on the same wavelength as Mr Barton—the person who has blown the whistle on the government—an honourable public servant. We are trying to prove that the Australian people were deceived and this parliament was deceived when the government said it knew nothing about it and was not informed of these things until they became public matters.</para><para>Why would we want to know if the government knew something about it beforehand? The reason is that we take our allied duties seriously. Anyone can see, and it certainly was obviously the case after this issue broke out, that this would hand our enemies an unsurpassed propaganda victory and, if there were an opportunity to give a sensible warning to our ally that this sort of behaviour would be 100 per cent counterproductive to the objectives we seek in our life-and-death struggle with militant, fundamentalist terror, we would want at least a performance by the government in that regard.</para><para>The government seeks always to evade responsibility. When you take upon yourself the sort of struggle that is now being engaged in in Iraq, however mistaken that may be, you take upon yourself every single element of it. You must know the detail of what is going on with all armed service personnel in the area. And if a fella has come back and is seriously concerned enough to get the secretary of his department to write to the American ambassador here to warn him that this is going on—to get them back in the United States to stop things happening in Abu Ghraib—why in God's name didn't you do something about it? Instead of running around trying to evade responsibility and cover your backsides, why don't you just take a bit of responsibility for the jobs that you have in hand and deal with the problems? </para><para>A question was asked by the honourable member for Griffith about the difference between interrogation and interviewing. If a chap who is manacled thinks an interrogation is being conducted when the bloke standing behind the fellow in front of him has a gun, does he think he is having a little chat—`This is just a small conversation; a chin wag about the state of the world'? Fair dinkum, you must really think that we have a very foolish Australian public to wander around in this place hairsplitting on a subject like that. It is very important that you are hairsplitting. Why do you hairsplit on that? Is it to arrive at the truth of what we were told about Abu Ghraib and to have a bit of analysis about how we might have done a bit better in this? Is that the reason? No; because if we accept that `interview' means `interrogate' then the Prime Minister has lied to parliament. If he has lied to parliament, even under all the conventions the government has trampled on, the normal consequence is that you resign. He does not want that. He does not want Senator Hill to have to resign, he does not want to have to resign himself, and so words are given different meanings and decent people have their reputations trampled upon. That is what has happened in this case.</para><para>Finally, we get the performance. I have got to get myself onto the tactics committee of the other side and pinch a few of the questions—like the one that was asked today of the Deputy Prime Minister. If anything ever exposed what they were on about with these regional rorts, that was an absolute ripper. The only person who did not feature in the announcements in Brand was the member for Brand. Everybody else had a chop. Every Liberal Party and National Party minister had his fingerprints on it. They all had a chop, but the honourable member for Brand missed out. The simple fact of the matter is this: you have used $400 million of taxpayers' funds to undermine your political opponents. In most countries, that is described as corruption. Unfortunately, the consequence of this is that it has stripped your capacity to deal with the infrastructure of this nation on a proper basis. That is what it has done. We do have problems like that coal loader in Queensland and we do have problems with the port-rail interface. Why? Because the Commonwealth has put all the funds for those purposes into the campaign treasuries of the National Party and the Liberal Party, looting royally, and incompetently, I might say, as we have revealed in case after case in this place, and then has misled the Australian people about what it is up to. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

His real complaint is that this government won and that opposition lost. His real complaint is that for the fourth time members opposite have failed to secure the trust of the Australian people. So, rather than accepting the truth that members opposite simply are not up to it and that the last four times members opposite simply have not put an adequate case to the Australian people for their election, rather than accept that simple, democratic truth, he has to pretend that somehow `they was robbed'. `We was robbed' is the essential claim that the Leader of the Opposition is making now. He made it in 1998; he made it in 1996. It is this constant, tired refrain: `We was robbed.'

People are no longer in any doubt about what the Labor Party stands for and we will be able to build on that.</para></quote><para>These people who claim that there is nothing more important than being open and honest are the same people who distributed this document. It is a document distributed by the secretariat of the Australian Labor Party to all frontbenchers and spokesmen on election night. Plainly, it is a tissue of lies, an absolute fabrication from start to finish. The Labor Party were so united that their leader was dumped humiliatingly, acrimoniously and unprecedentedly just a couple of months after the election campaign.</para><para>The fact of the matter is that these people opposite, huffing and puffing hysterically about the alleged lies and deceit of this government, do not come to this debate with clean hands. We have seen from the Leader of the Opposition over the last couple of weeks a bad case of political schizophrenia because obviously there are two Kims. There is Brand Kim, who is desperately seeking, desperately demanding, Regional Partnerships grants, desperately trying to claim the credit for $1.1 million worth of Regional Partnerships grants in his electorate, writing to the Deputy Prime Minister demanding that the government provide Regional Partnerships grants to his electorate, distributing to his electorate newsletters that try to claim credit for the award of Regional Partnerships grants in his electorate, and then there is Canberra Kim, who tries to suggest that all of this is some kind of giant boondoggle, that this is some kind of giant election slush fund. You cannot have it both ways: it is impossible to be in favour of Regional Partnerships grants in your electorate and opposed to Regional Partnerships grants in this parliament. The Leader of the Opposition stands exposed yet again, as he has stood so many times in this parliament, as a hypocrite, as a two-timer, as someone who says one thing in the electorate and another thing in this parliament. The Australian people know him, they have rejected him and they are not going to let him get away with this kind of treatment of the parliament and the people for that much longer. </para><para>The lie to the claims from members opposite was given today in a most interesting opinion piece on the op-ed page of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review. </inline>One of the more credible, one of the more honourable and one of the more honest members of the Australian Labor Party is the member for Melbourne—a member of this parliament who, if the Leader of the Opposition himself had more strength and more integrity, would be on the frontbench of the Australian Labor Party. He is misguided in many respects, but he is honest and he is honourable. He tells the truth: he says what he means and means what he says. What did the member for Melbourne say today in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> of this whole tedious campaign that has been run by the Leader of the Opposition over the past fortnight? I quote:</para><quote><para>Sadly, neither I nor the Labor Party have been entirely pure in these matters.

As opposition transport spokesman, I promised to fund a study into pilot training at Launceston Airport and a rail research institute in Adelaide.</para></quote><para>He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>It's about time we got serious about the misuse of money ...</para></quote><para>He has given the lie to the entire Labor Party campaign of the last fortnight—guilty as charged, he says of the Australian Labor Party. This is not a guilty government; this is a guilty opposition. Indeed, if there is any guilt in this, and I do not believe that there is, it is a guilty parliament.

There is no evidence that anyone on the frontbench of this government has ever answered questions other than honestly on the basis of the best knowledge available to that minister at that time. As the Prime Minister said so well in this chamber today, there is no evidence that Senator Hill has done anything other than patiently and comprehensively answer questions put to him on the basis of the best advice that he had at the time.</para><para>This is an opposition which has become somewhat hysterical. What is behind all the activities of the last few days? It is not concern for the people of Iraq. It is not concern for Cornelia Rau. It is not concern for the dental health of the people of New South Wales. All that matters to them is trying to prove that the Prime Minister is an incompetent liar. I think they need to get over their fixation with Prime Minister Howard. I think they need to have a long, hard look at themselves. In particular, the Leader of the Opposition needs to have a long, hard look at himself and try to prove that he is different from the person that the Australian people do know well and have rejected so often. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>95</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name><name.id>UK6</name.id><electorate>Wills</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to complement the Leader of the Opposition's contribution to this debate by talking about the need for us to get honesty from this government with the Australian people in relation to Regional Partnerships, which has degenerated into an all-singing, all-dancing $400 million Howard government slush fund.

The Beaudesert railway is now left with just a steam engine, which is itself security for an outstanding debt to the Queensland government. What a monument to this government's financial mismanagement—a sorry tale of government ineptitude and incompetence, of throwing good taxpayers' money after bad. We had the Prime Minister in here yesterday telling the House he made an `on-balance judgment' to provide a further $660,000 of taxpayers' money to Beaudesert Rail. Never mind that this made a complete joke of the Regional Partnerships guidelines about the need for financial viability, never mind that the department believed it was not financially viable, never mind that the provisional liquidator did not believe it was financially viable, never mind its failure to properly acquit the $5 million Centenary of Federation funds: the Prime Minister made an `on-balance judgment' to put another $660,000 of taxpayers' money into this lemon.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Why did he do it? He did it to save the Liberal member for Forde from embarrassment in the lead-up to an election. You see, she had her name all over the original $5 million Centenary of Federation grant to get the Beaudesert Rail project up and going. When she heard that this project was about to go off the rails and the $5 million was going to be wasted, she was no doubt mortified. She is the person who persuaded the Prime Minister to first offer a $400,000 loan and later turn it into a $660,000 grant—$660,000 to save the face of the member for Forde. Menelaus thought Helen of Troy's face worthy of the launch of a thousand ships. The Prime Minister thought the member for Forde's face worthy of $660,000 of taxpayers' money!</para><para>The 13 June 2003 report of the provisional liquidator makes this absolutely clear. He says that, after his appointment, he was able to conclude that Beaudesert Rail could not pay its creditors merely from trading. He says that he contacted Mrs Kay Elson, the federal member for Forde, to discuss the possibility of receiving further funds. He says: `In a discussion with Ms Elson and Mr Ron Munn, the Mayor of Beaudesert, it was clearly put to me that by keeping the train trading, albeit at a loss, it would significantly enhance the prospects of receiving federal government funding.' The provisional liquidator then became caught between the concerns of creditors, on the one hand—he says that `the committee of creditors were understandably concerned that we were trading at a loss'; they were trading while insolvent—and, on the other hand, the urgings of the member for Forde to keep the train going.</para><para>The provisional liquidator decided to bring things to a head. He said that, unless something concrete was received by 5 June 2003, Beaudesert Rail should cease business and market its assets for sale. The next day, he said, `It was made clear to me by Mr Munn and Ms Elson that approval of government funding was a matter of days away and that this funding was to save Beaudesert Rail and to close down would make it more difficult to obtain the funding, if not impossible.' On Friday, 6 June, he said, `I received a letter from Ms Elson advising that government funding was imminent and I made the decision to trade the business over the weekend to see if this was the case.' Honourable members, I am sure, can feel the air of crisis here. On 12 June 2003, the provisional liquidator received a letter from the Prime Minister making a conditional offer of a $400,000 loan. </para><para>It is absolutely clear from the provisional liquidator's report that the actions of the member for Forde and the Prime Minister compromised the government and, therefore, Australian taxpayers in this matter. The reason Beaudesert Rail kept running during this period, its losses increasing with each passing week, was because the member for Forde and the Prime Minister had made representations to the provisional liquidator. Just imagine if, after all that, the government had said, `We've examined your project, and we think it's a dog, and we're not going to give it any more money,' the creditors would have been outraged, and with good reason. So we come to the end of the line for $5.7 million of taxpayers' money. Where the Prime Minister should have been interrogating the member for Forde over that money, it looks like he did not even bother to interview her.</para><para>Where there is a rort, you just feel it in your bones, you know the National Party is going to be in there somewhere—and so it is here. The Beaudesert Rail project had been spearheaded by Joy Drescher, a former National Party candidate for state parliament, who was elected mayor of Beaudesert earlier this year. Yesterday the member for Grayndler urged the Prime Minister to carpe diem—to seize the day—on the issue of climate change. But the National Party has its own motto. It is not carpe diem; it is carpe prosciutto—Latin for `seize the pork'. The member for Hotham, who fancies himself as a bit of a Latin scholar, thinks it should be carpe porchetta—but perhaps he is just advertising a restaurant chain. The National Party is so reliable in this that I have developed my own law of physics, which says: `Where there's a coalition trough, there's a National Party snout.' Now I know it is not as elegant or as important as Einstein's law of relativity or Newton's law of gravity, but it holds good for the overwhelming majority of Howard government programs.</para><para>And so it is that we heard today that it is not just the National Party mayor of Beaudesert but the National Party mayor of Tweed Heads, south of the border, Mr Warren Polglase, who recommended a $273,000 Dairy Assistance Program grant to Seawind, a South Tweed seafood company which has now gone bust. Mr Polglase is a very active man. He is the mayor of Tweed Shire Council, the local National Party Electorate Council chair and a member of the Northern Rivers Area Consultative Committee. He managed to get himself appointed as an executive officer or a project officer to administer the Dairy Assistance Program.</para><para>We understand that this position was advertised but that no interviews—certainly no interrogations—for the position were ever held. Warren Polglase just got the job. Minister Anderson needs to inform the parliament and the Australian people just what selection process Mr Polglase went through before he was given this position. Mr Polglase has all the hallmarks of the Queensland National Party under Joh Bjelke-Petersen. If you read what has been happening in the New South Wales inquiry, you will discover that he is something of a colourful National Party identity. But, as the executive officer for the Dairy Assistance Program, he managed to recommend $88,000 in Dairy Regional Assistance grant money to prominent National Party supporters to add farm-stay accommodation to their tea tree farm and to recommend $273,000 of taxpayers' money to Seawind, a South Tweed seafood company that has subsequently gone bust. </para><para>My time is coming to a close but, as there was a bit of enthusiasm for the nursery rhyme last week, I will conclude with a verse:</para><quote><para>The Ballad of Beaudesert Rail</para><para>They say it comes out on the nights of full moon</para><para>The ghost train of Beaudesert from its rusting cocoon</para><para>It once used to run amid whoops amid hollers</para><para>Till it chewed up 5 million of taxpayers' dollars</para><para>The Deputy PM put it back on the track</para><para>With six hundred grand more that went straight up the stack</para><para>So now it sits idle a monument stored</para><para>And nobody comes when they shout “All aboard”</para><para>And they talk about rorts and they talk about fraud</para><para>Of a train with one passenger, the Member here for Forde</para><para>And it's just a classic case of throwing good money after bad</para><para>And how voters they were conned, and taxpayers they were had.</para><para>But there's still hope for it yet tho much ill of it we speak</para><para>Build a rail line to Dobell?

As a poet he has no chance at all. This matter of public importance, which says, `The need for the government to be open and honest with the Australian people,' is a joke—the ALP talking about honesty and integrity in government! They should be the last ones to talk about it. In fact, we all remember the lead-up to the 1993 election, when the tax cuts were going to become `l-a-w law'. There were going to be no tax increases at all. You could rest on it—Paul Keating went out and told the Australian public: `You can trust this Labor government. You can rely on it. We will deliver on our promises. There will be no tax increases.' Of course, once the election— <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></talk.start><para>It is very clear that the opposition do not want to hear the truth about what they promised in 1993 in terms of l-a-w law. Labor promised there were going to be tax cuts and what happened? They did not happen at all. Then, of course, when they went to the 1996 election the current Leader of the Opposition, the then minister for finance, told us that there was a surplus of $10.1 billion. He said that frequently around the country. What was the reality of it? In fact, a week after this government came to office we found it was a $10.3 billion deficit. So much for honesty. It was only a $20 billion lie—not bad—and it was the Leader of the Opposition who got up and said it.</para><para>Of course, we remember that wonderful institution Centenary House. It is just a prime example of honesty and integrity in government. It is like a symbol. If you went into the old East Block, there would be a symbol of the working man there to show what they are about. I think in future there will be tours to Centenary House to show people: this is what the Labor Party in office believed was appropriate integrity, honesty and openness for the Australian people. It was called a $43 billion rort. And they are the ones who are lecturing us on honesty.</para><para>Regarding the regional grants that we are now talking about, there were some 800 applications from coalition held seats and 200 from Labor held seats. They were too busy having their lattes and chardonnays to actually help people fill in their applications. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> Again the Labor Party do not want to hear the truth. The Labor Party did not assist their communities to apply for regional grants. The fact is that the percentage of applications that were approved for Labor seats and the percentage approved for coalition seats was exactly the same. There was clearly no bias; it was independently audited three times by KPMG. There were three reviews which made no findings of impropriety. </para><para>By contrast, we remember old Ros Kelly, the then member for Canberra. Did she know how to rort. She was the master of rort with the old whiteboard: `We'll have five for the Labor Party, one for the coalition, 10 for the Labor Party.' They took the whiteboard to great excellence but she did not survive. That was the member for Canberra who taught us all about what she thought was truth and honesty in government. It shows quite clearly that they have no understanding of what truth and honesty are.</para><para>In the last election they made $40 billion of promises and they said that PricewaterhouseCoopers was going to do a total audit of the costings and they indicated that they were properly funded. PricewaterhouseCoopers had to put out a statement saying that that was wrong, that all that they were required to do was to add up the amount. There was no verification of whether the funding was appropriate or the claims they made as to where the funding was. A lot of it was purely bogus money all the way through. They failed to submit their policies to Treasury and Finance before the deadline set by the department. They did not put their whole tax policy before the deadline or their child-care policy, their schools policy or their defence policy. Labor even refused to submit Medicare Gold.</para><para>In the debate today we have the Leader of the Opposition, a former finance minister, talking about interest rates. He accused this government in outrageous terms. He talked about the increases in interest rates that are happening, and of course there has been no announcement by the Reserve Bank at all about interest rate increases. We remember what the interest rates were under the other side—17 per cent. For small business it went up to 21 per cent. Under this government the amount is five to 6½ per cent. The Leader of the Opposition wants to indicate his economic credentials, but it is clear he knows nothing about interest rates.</para><para>On the issues of credibility, honesty and reliability, it is this side of the House that sets the example. The Charter of Budget Honesty that we provided set out the parameters. It showed the lies, the fraud, the dishonesty, the rorting of the previous government. We have shown what integrity in government is really about. The mob opposite are just producing a total sham. It is time they decided to get with the program and decide that honesty in government is the way to go. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

During the election there was another commitment made, a commitment to a football stadium, but it was made by the opposition. The stadium we are talking about used to be called Marathon Stadium; it is now called Energy Australia Stadium. The state government, which own this facility and are responsible for it, have already put in some $32 million. They seem to demand that the federal government also contribute $32 million towards their facility. I am not against providing money for a football stadium but, as I said to my constituents during the election—and I said it before and I said it during and I say it after the election—I put the issues and interests of my electorate first, second, third and last.</para></talk.start><para>The football stadium is not in my electorate. In fact it is not a responsibility of this government. On the Central Coast the Graham Park Stadium that was built at Gosford was built for around $23 million in total. I have to ask: why is it that only half a stadium can be built for $32 million and why the cost blow-out to $60 million? Should the board of the International Sports Centre Trust achieve the funding from the state government then I wish them well, because there is no doubt that the area does deserve a world-class football stadium. But it should be funded by those that own the stadium.</para><para>The issues that are important to my electorate are roads, health and education. That is what we committed to; that is what we were determined to deliver to the people of Paterson. I spoke before about road funding and I spoke about the money that had been offered to the councils of Port Stephens, Dungog and Great Lakes. We have put $10 million on the table which is to be matched by the state government with an additional $10 million. The funding is broken up into three groupings. Two million dollars is for Great Lakes Shire. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>This will probably go down as the greatest hour of contribution from the member for Shortland: the greatest contribution she can make is to draw the chair's attention to the state of the House. On that side of the House we have an impotent member of parliament who can deliver nothing to her electorate. That is the same member who under the Regional Solutions program condemned this government for providing no packages to her electorate. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know why no packages were delivered to her electorate? It was because she had not even bothered to work with her community to put in any applications. That is the sort of member that she is. She is impotent and should not be in this place. If it were not for the fact that she had such a safe seat she would not be here. She is a disgrace as a member. She cannot even convince her colleagues in the New South Wales government to deliver projects in the Hunter. </para><para>Road funding suffers in the Hunter under the Carr state Labor government, of which she was a member prior to coming to this place—and she has done nothing since to help to deliver projects. The football stadium that I spoke about is the responsibility of the Carr Labor government and, again, she has done nothing to represent her constituents in obtaining money from the state Labor government. She sits there, whines, whinges and delivers nothing on behalf of her constituents in the seat of Shortland. It is absolutely disgraceful. As I said, perhaps the best contribution she has made in this place is bringing on three quorums because she is bored and ineffective as a member of parliament.</para><para>I am proud of the road funding that I deliver to my electorate.

I stand up proudly for the Hunter Valley and I deliver things. I try to represent my constituents with honour. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have just seen two efforts from two members of the Hunter that are disgraceful in terms of allowing free speech and allowing me to represent my constituents in this place. I was speaking about road funding, what we have delivered and what we have promised, but I can bet that the state Labor government will not match our $10 million that we are putting into this community.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Why did we have to do that? We had to do it because we put $20 million into the Bucketts Way, which the member for Hunter, who has just left the chamber under your instructions, opposed each and every step of the way. The state government refused to contribute to their road, the Bucketts Way. But work is carrying on and the difference that it is making is that there has been a reduction in fatalities on the Bucketts Way. That is the best reason to invest in roads: to save people's lives, to make them safer and to improve the economic conditions of every person that travels on them. The $10 million that we are offering to the local councils includes $2 million for the Lakes Way—a road that is in very poor state. But the state government seems to wash its hands of that one, which is a major road for tourism through Bulahdelah to Pacific Palms through the Forster-Tuncurry area. </para><para>But do we hear a word from the state Labor government? Not a word. We are putting $2 million into Port Stephens Council for the road between Raymond Terrace and Glen Oak. In addition, $6 million will go to the Dungog Council for the road from Glen Oak up through to Dungog. This is an area that was heavily affected by the decision of the former Prime Minister to shut down the timber industry. That was the first nail in the coffin for the township of Dungog. The second was when, in the New South Wales parliament, the member for Shortland's friend Bob Carr moved for dairy deregulation. That was the second thing that hurt and hit my township.</para><para>I do not sit back; I get on the front foot and drive for economic improvement in my area. I want to create jobs in my area, so I lobbied and lobbied and have been able to deliver $10 million worth of road funding. The question was put to me when the members for Shortland and Hunter stood up proudly and said, `We want to fund a football stadium.' The Labor federal government was going to throw $30 million into a football stadium. I said I would rather put $10 million into roads because that will help save lives; that will improve the economic conditions of those towns that those roads serve. That is money well spent and well invested in our community, and I am determined to deliver on it.</para><para>But there is a hitch. Because the member for Shortland's friend Bob Carr would not commit money to match it on the Bucketts Way, we had to make it a condition of approval. What have they said so far? The recently ousted minister for roads, Carl Scully, said, `I'm not going to fund it.' Now we have a new Minister for Roads in New South Wales, Michael Costa. He is also the minister for the Hunter. Let us hope he has a different attitude towards saving people's lives and improving roads and economic conditions in regional and rural areas. After all, he is not only the roads minister, he is the minister for the Hunter. Guess what they have just done—and this is why I doubt we are going to get anything. The Newcastle Knights just made him their patron. So his focus will be on a football stadium not on the fatalities. He will not be interested in saving lives in my electorate.</para><para>The other issue I have is that the state government in New South Wales have absolutely no hesitation in spending another $1 billion on a tunnel under Sydney to improve traffic flow. It does not save any lives; it just improves traffic flow. Can you imagine what a billion dollars of road funding from the New South Wales government would do in rural and regional areas? It would go a long way towards fixing and finishing off the road between Sydney and Brisbane—the Pacific Highway.

The attitude from the opposition has been disgraceful, but they will never stop me standing up for the people that I represent, pushing for the issues that are important to them and making sure that I give them the best possible representation I can in this place.

The first issue relates to the Australian Broadcasting Authority and its failure to grant a radio licence for Sydney frequency 1386AM. I foreshadow that the second issue I will raise, if I do not get time to do so today, concerns the government's failure to protect free-to-air television viewers from a loophole in the antisiphoning regime.</para></talk.start><para>There is a long history attached to the ABA's failure to grant a radio licence for Sydney frequency 1386AM. I am advised that on 25 May 2001 the ABA formed a preliminary view that an additional wide coverage community radio service should be made available in Sydney and called for public comment as to the suitable use of 1386AM for community radio. I am advised that on 27 July 2001 the ABA received several submissions, including one from Sydney Christian Broadcasters Ltd, also known as Rhema Sydney, on behalf of Sydney's estimated 900,000 churchgoing Christians. I am also advised that on 27 December 2001 the ABA received a revised draft variation to the Sydney radio licence area plan, proposing alternative sites for the community radio station. After receiving further submissions, the ABA continued to announce its support for a community radio station.</para><para>In March 2002 the ABA decided to make 1386AM available as a community broadcasting service instead of a narrowcasting service. On 15 July 2002 the ABA invited new applications for the Sydney-wide community radio licence transmitting on the 1386AM band. Again, fresh submissions were called for. On 26 March 2003 the ABA decided not to allocate radio licence 1386AM. In each case, Radio Rhema made submissions. In the final decision, the ABA was concerned about the location of a transmission station in the Sydney suburb of Homebush in my electorate of Lowe, allegedly because of concerns about proximity to new homes. On this basis, a decision was deferred for 12 months.</para><para>I am further advised that, in March 2003, eight applicants bid for the allocation of a Sydney community radio operator licence on frequency 1386 megahertz on the amplitude modulation, or AM, band. At that time, the ABA rejected all eight licence applicants. This rejection is of itself not unusual, but the failure of the ABA to grant a temporary licence was unusual. Incredibly, on 22 April 2004 the ABA called for yet another round of public comment. To this very day, there has still been no decision by the ABA to grant this radio licence.</para><para>By far the main contender in the application process is Rhema Sydney. The narrowing of bids to two main contenders follows other bidders dropping out. Put simply, Rhema Sydney has demonstrated overwhelming public interest. Rhema Sydney's application greatly outweighed all other applications in responses from the general public of Sydney, who strongly called for Rhema Sydney to be granted the 1386AM licence. In its submission, Rhema Sydney notes that it has in excess of 4,000 members and over 750 letters in support representing close to 460,000 individuals in the greater Sydney region. </para><para>I am advised that an estimated 2.4 million Sydney residents identify themselves as Christian—that is, some 66 per cent of the Sydney metropolitan population. I am advised that an estimated 1.8 million Sydney residents attend church services at least at Easter or Christmas. Thus it may be said there are in Sydney nearly two million Christians who adhere to the main feast days on the Christian calendar. In addition, an estimated 900,000 people in Sydney are reported to attend Christian church services at least monthly.</para><para>Compounding the fact that there is a high percentage of Christians in the Sydney metropolitan area, a large number of the population are social service recipients who rely on broadcast information. Such broadcast services include the necessity for talkback radio and other media access. The average percentage of Christians in any one Sydney electorate is between 25 and 30 per cent. In my electorate of Lowe, the percentage of practising Christians reaches nearly 50 per cent. Finally, there are an estimated 2,000 Christian places of worship throughout Sydney.</para><para>In every sense, the Christian voice is frustrated in its ability to be heard. With reference to 2CBA FM, it is often claimed that Sydney already has one Christian radio station. With respect, this is a false argument. 2CBA FM does a wonderful job. However, its target audience and scope is much narrower than the proposed broadcasting service's community of interest. Firstly, it is intended that Rhema Sydney will service the broader Sydney Christian community, who have long suffered without a voice, to broadcast their services and address their mass-market needs. Secondly, Rhema Sydney intends to cater for the larger, different and cross-denominational Christian markets, each of which have demonstrably different needs and interests within the greater Sydney metropolitan area. Programming will include talkback, alternative journalists' views on news and other public affairs items, and it will give the large Christian community a voice on the public airwaves. Moreover, Rhema Sydney intends to be a voice for people with disabilities, older Australians, youth and those marginalised in our society.</para><para>I call on the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to intervene in this matter and accept the overwhelming support of the Sydney community and the demonstrable public interest in the granting of a temporary licence to Rhema Sydney on radio frequency 1386AM. The ABA has prevaricated, obfuscated and simply refused to admit that the Rhema proposal shines above any of the other bidders. The Rhema application easily outweighs the other contenders in size, public support and sheer quality.</para><para>The facts are undeniable: there is a great unmet need for Christian radio broadcasting in the Sydney metropolitan area. There is, in my opinion, utterly no justification whatsoever for refusing to grant Rhema Sydney a radio licence or at least a temporary licence. The necessity for the ABA to call for public submissions four times is absurd. The information gathered and the submissions received—many of them from members of this House—all point to the needs of the supporters of clearly the largest and most comprehensive submission for a licence for a radio station. I urge the minister to recognise the cross-party support, including support from members of her own coalition colleagues, in granting Rhema Sydney this transmission licence. </para><para>Mr Speaker, on another matter, you would be aware of my longstanding campaign to protect the public interest and Australia's democracy by exposing the Howard government's pandering to the interests of the major media proprietors in tearing down Australia's cross-media laws. Another appalling example of the Howard government's determination to serve the interests of the major media proprietors, ahead of the interests of the Australian people, is the cynical way the government has managed the broadcasting services antisiphoning list. The antisiphoning list is supposed to protect Australian households who do not have access to pay television from being denied important sporting events on free-to-air television. The antisiphoning list is designed to protect free-to-air television viewers by guaranteeing the rights of free-to-air television channels—that is, Nine, Seven, Ten, the ABC and SBS—to buy the broadcast rights to sporting events listed on the antisiphoning list. Some examples of events on the antisiphoning list, which is current until December 2010, include the Olympic Games, the Melbourne Cup, Australian rugby union and cricket test matches, the 2006 FIFA World Cup and rugby league and Australian rules football matches.</para><para>It is important to understand that the antisiphoning list does not guarantee that an event will be on free-to-air television. If the free-to-air broadcasters decline to purchase rights to listed events, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts may delist such events, allowing pay television providers to acquire the rights to televise the event. Moreover, of far greater importance, especially to the millions of Australians who have always enjoyed the coverage of nationally significant sporting events on free-to-air television, is the loophole in the antisiphoning laws. This loophole has, very sadly, all but ensured that for the first time in more than 33 years Australia's Ashes test cricket series in England from July to September 2005 will not be broadcast on free-to-air television, despite the fact that it is on the antisiphoning list. How has this happened? Free-to-air broadcasters blame a loophole in the antisiphoning laws. Remember that the antisiphoning regime was established to ensure important sporting events, such as the Ashes cricket, would not become exclusive to pay-TV licensees, such as Foxtel.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>105</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Mr Peter Harris, a leading member of the scouting community in the ACT, came up with the original concept of a cuboree some years ago, and this most recent event was the seventh cuboree to be held. They are held every three years and we have witnessed growing participation and popularity each time. In fact, other states and territories are now holding or developing similar cuborees within their own jurisdictions.</para></talk.start><para>I had the pleasure of visiting the camp site during this three- to four-day event in the middle of January. The cuboree was held at the Kangaroo Flat camping ground here in Canberra—an area that was very savagely affected by the 18 January 2003 fires which occurred in the ACT. It is an absolute testament to the dedication and determination of everyone involved in the scouting movement in Canberra, under the leadership of the Chief Commissioner of Scouts ACT, Neville Tomkins, that they could even imagine going ahead and holding a cuboree of this size on this site, given the damage that was incurred just over two years ago. </para><para>The theme for this year's cuboree was `Dream on' with activities around the camp site encouraging the youngsters to establish their dreams, learn to have the courage to strive for them and learn how to encourage others in their team to dare to dream with them. A time capsule from the 1996 cuboree, containing the hopes and the dreams of cubs at that particular function, was dug up by some who were there at that time.</para><para>Altogether 1,150 people, including more than 800 cubs, plus leaders and volunteers, attended this cuboree. That is a pretty large number of folk under tents for three to four days in the heat of January in Canberra. If any member is planning a similarly large event, I can assure them that I have a recipe available from the people who ran this cuboree, which will produce spaghetti bolognaise for 1,150 people. The recipe starts with 195 kilograms of mince and 140 kilograms of spaghetti. That gives you an idea of the enormous size of this particular event.</para><para>When I visited, with other guests for the afternoon, I was absolutely moved by the enthusiasm of the leaders and the volunteers in ensuring that these young people from the ACT, New South Wales and some areas of South Australia, who came to participate in this three-yearly event, had the best time and learnt a great deal. There was a massive camaraderie and it was all a testament to the people who organised it.</para><para>On a second issue, I would like to make brief reference to the recent very tragic fires in South Australia. As the member for Canberra, I can assure the House and the member for Grey, Mr Wakelin, of my concern and compassion on behalf of the community here towards the community in South Australia and the Eyre Peninsula. The events there brought back bad memories for us and we know the sort of trauma that they were facing during those tragic fires in South Australia.</para><para>I have to commend the ACT government. They very quickly got in touch with the authorities in South Australia and offered ACT SES assistance. A public servant, Di Butcher, who achieved a great deal in successfully establishing and running the ACT Bushfire Recovery Centre, has, I believe, visited South Australia—at their wish—on several occasions to assist them to set up a similar sort of arrangement in that area of South Australia. We learnt a great deal through the necessities of the events surrounding the fires here in January 2003 and we were only too happy to offer whatever support, compassion and sympathy we could.</para><para>The residents of Duffy—part of my constituency that was very severely hit by the fires of 2003—immediately started fundraising and I believe they have already raised over $2,000, and that amount is increasing. The Duffy residents suffered the sort of damage that epitomised what was unfortunately felt here in Canberra and they immediately wanted to step in and offer some sort of support to those people on the Eyre Peninsula—and they are doing so, along with other people in my constituency. I take the opportunity to offer, on behalf of my constituents, our sympathies to those people who were so severely and tragically affected on the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, and our ongoing support in any way that we can offer, given our experience. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Mrs Melinda Poor</title><page.no>107</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>107</page.no><name role="metadata">Keenan, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KEENAN</name><name.id>E0J</name.id><electorate>Stirling</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Yesterday in this House the member for Wills made reference to one of my constituents, Mrs Melinda Poor, who is also the Liberal candidate for the state seat of Balcatta in the upcoming election. The member for Wills recounted the events that occurred when Mrs Poor called into a radio station where the former member for Stirling and I were having a live debate. He believes her call caused a great deal of electoral grief for the Labor member for Stirling.</para></talk.start><para>I might remind the House of what actually transpired. The debate between the former member and me occurred not long after the Labor Party released their new family tax package. Astonishingly, this package would have disadvantaged struggling families in many areas of my electorate and around Australia. Mrs Poor called ABC radio to express her concern that her husband and three children would be roughly $500 worse off under the Labor Party's policy. At that time she was pregnant with her fourth child and when the baby was born she would have become roughly $1,000 worse off under Labor's policy. So Mrs Poor, quite rightly, called her local member and asked her what she thought of local families being disadvantaged in this way.</para><para>The former member for Stirling replied that the Labor Party would need to look at changing the package. At the time, this rightly caused a media storm as the opposition struggled to explain why they would adopt such a punitive tax regime. Following the former member for Stirling's comments, the Labor Party gagged her and she was not allowed to talk to the media for rest of the campaign. My campaign team and I really had a laugh when the Labor Party would not even let her finish a prearranged commitment to do a 90-second pre-recorded interview about her hobbies.</para><para>I would suggest to the member for Wills that it was not one of my constituents calling talkback radio to truthfully express her concern about how her family was going to suffer under a Labor government that caused the former member for Stirling electoral grief. It was the person who dreamed up Labor's failed electoral platform plus the actions of the former member that were to blame. The people of Stirling were not prepared to wear a party that attacked the living standards of those described by one Perth reporter as `world-class battlers'.</para><para>As to the concerns expressed that Mrs Poor and I had met before she called the radio, it is well known that we did. What Mrs Poor actually said later in the same article quoted by the member for Wills is that we did not know each other well. Fortunately, though, since that time I have come to know Mrs Poor because I have been campaigning with her as she is the Liberal candidate for Balcatta. I have spent time campaigning and listening to the concerns that the people of Stirling have about the Gallop state Labor government. I can tell the member for Wills that the people of the state electorate of Balcatta are sick of the indecision, the committees, the inquiries, the scoping studies, the reports and the total inability of the state Labor government to make decisions and to get on with the job of governing the great state of Western Australia. They are crying out to be represented by real people from their own communities who understand their needs and aspirations—exactly the sort of candidate represented by Mrs Poor. So I predict that, just as the people of Stirling rejected federal Labor, the people of WA will reject state Labor on 26 February and vote for Colin Barnett and his Liberal team to give us decisions, not more delays. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>China: Mine Safety</title><page.no>108</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>108</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this evening to talk on the issue of mine safety in China. At a time when Australia's relationship with China is becoming increasingly important to our economic future, I address the House this evening on a subject that must not be ignored in the context of negotiating a bilateral trade agreement, future investment flows and the production and manufacture of our traded resources, goods and services. That subject is, of course, human rights and core labour standards.</para></talk.start><para>Earlier this week a massive gas explosion ripped through the Sunjiawan coalmine in north-eastern China, killing more than 200 workers. This is a great tragedy for the families of those workers and their communities, and I am sure all Australians extend their deepest sympathy to them. The incident itself is particularly concerning because the Sunjiawan colliery is one of the bigger, more modern mines in China and because the blast follows a complete overhaul of safety ordered by the Prime Minister. This followed two earlier underground disasters late last year in which 166 miners were killed in Shaanxi and 148 killed in Henan. Officially, and interestingly, it is reported that more than 6,000 workers were killed in coalmines alone in China last year. But human rights and labour organisations claim that the real figure is closer to 20,000 deaths per year.</para><para>I hope we would agree on both sides of the parliament that the main goal of economic development and trade is to advance the human condition. I hope we would also agree that respect for human life and the protection of human rights is and must remain at the core of all our public policy. As the President of the ACTU noted earlier this week, free trade advocates would argue that the market will automatically provide for improvements in living standards for working people and for the protection of their human rights. This ignores the fact that all markets are actually regulated at some level. For example, the World Trade Organisation establishes trade rules incorporating a dispute resolution process and an enforcement mechanism, and those rules are supported by all the major nations. Similarly, the International Labour Office promulgates international labour standards to assure human rights and effective minimum standards for working people and employer representatives, yet these rules are seen by the major nations as a fetter on market forces.</para><para>Our government, unfortunately, refuses to sign ILO Convention 176, the Safety and Health in Mines Convention, not because our mining industry cannot meet it but because it is a government ideologically opposed to the rights of working men and women to guaranteed minimum labour standards and to the right of the ILO to promote them. This is a government committed to dragging Australian labour standards, including health and safety, down to the lowest common denominator of the trading nations. This is unacceptable to the opposition and it is unacceptable to the great majority of working men and women in Australia. We in the Labor party believe in the right to collectively bargain and in the need for effective minimum standards to provide the market with parameters that ensure working men and women get a fair share of the fruits of their endeavours. Core labour standards are also essential to guarantee more sustainable development and rising standards of living for people in poorer countries. There is no trickle-down effect.</para><para>At the moment China is the key market supporting Australia's resources boom, but it is also a potential competitor in resources trade and it is certainly a competitor in manufacturing. It is therefore incumbent on the government, when entering discussions with China about bilateral trade, to also talk about equal core labour standards that uphold the rights of working people to a safe workplace, the right to fair minimum wages and conditions and the right to collectively bargain. It is time for the government, too, to look at the track record of companies on labour practices when they invest in this country, particularly in the area of health and safety. This is one of the areas in which the Treasurer and the Foreign Investment Review Board could, and should, impose conditions on foreign investment in the nation's best interest. </para><para>It is time for Australia to play a bigger role in international labour markets, particularly in promoting health and safety in the workplace and respect for human life. International trade negotiations are one of the key avenues we can and must use to do this. It is now up to our trade negotiators in the proposed Australia-China free trade agreement to have regard to these accepted minimum international standards, core working standards developed by a tripartite process at the International Labour Office—employer, worker and government representatives—standards which any decent human being would expect. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Mr Mamdouh Habib</title><page.no>1</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>1</page.no><name role="metadata">Wood, Jason, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WOOD</name><name.id>E0F</name.id><electorate>La Trobe</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I stand here today to highlight the threats we face in the war on terrorism. As a former senior sergeant with the Victoria Police Counter Terrorism Coordination Unit, this issue is particularly close to me. Australians abroad have endured much heartache at the hands of terrorists from the September 11 plane crashes in America to the bombing of the Sari nightclub in Bali. The threat of terrorism still hangs over Australia, and our darkest hour may be yet to come.</para></talk.start><para>The release of Mamdouh Habib from Guantanamo Bay and his recent interviews raise the dilemma: is he a terrorist or a person who for no reason has been targeted by authorities both here and abroad? As Habib was recently released and has spoken openly about his experiences in detention, which have been well reported in the media and by the Australian Labor Party, I feel it is important to look at what we currently know about his experiences prior to his arrest in Pakistan in 2001.</para><para>In 1991, while in New York, Habib was invited by Ibrahim el-Gabrowny to rally support outside the courthouse where el-Gabrowny's cousin el-Sayyid Nosair was standing trial for the murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane. Apart from Habib and el-Gabrowny, Nosair's supporters in the courtroom included Mahmud Abouhalima. Abouhalima, el-Gabrowny and Habib were all followers of Omar Abdul Rahman, otherwise known as the `blind sheikh'—a militant cleric who calls for his followers to kill the enemies of God. Habib continued to have contact with el-Gabrowny and Omar Abdul Rahman after leaving New York. He even rallied other members of his Sydney mosque to help Rahman financially and to protest against his imprisonment.</para><para>On 26 February 1993, a bombing at the World Trade Centre in New York killed six people and injured over 1,000. Habib's friends, Abouhalima, el-Gabrowny and Rahman were all later arrested, charged and convicted for their involvement with the World Trade Centre bombing in 1993. Back in Australia, Sheikh Abu Ayman, head of the Haldon Street prayer hall in Lakemba, told the ABC's <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners </inline>program entitled `Worst of the Worst?' that Habib was lobbying for members to join a jihad and that he had turned up to the prayer hall wearing a ninja outfit on one occasion and an Osama bin Laden t-shirt on another. </para><para>Habib would later assist fundraising efforts for the Chechen rebels. There are reported links between the Chechnya rebels and al-Qaeda but, regardless, Chechen rebels have been responsible for a range of terrorist attacks, from the 700 hostages taken at the Moscow theatre in October 2002 to the Beslan school massacre in September 2004, where over 320 people, half of them children, were killed.</para><para>Habib's behaviour at the Haldon Street prayer hall led to Sheikh Abu Ayman banning him from the group. In 2000, Habib travelled to Pakistan for two months and upon his return announced his plans to go to Afghanistan to join the bin Laden camp. Mr Habib's friend Ibrahim Fraser told <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners </inline>that, in a conversation they had had, Habib had explained that he wanted to live in a bin Laden camp and that it would be a good life.</para><para>On 29 July 2001, Habib again visited Pakistan. It is believed that during this visit Mr Habib travelled to Afghanistan, as well as to Pakistan, and participated in an advanced al-Qaeda training course. Habib was captured after the September 11 attacks in Pakistan with two Germans: Ibrahim Diab and Bekim Ademi. Diab and Ademi were part of the Hamburg al-Qaeda cell led by Mohammed Atta, the lead hijacker in the September 11 attacks. Diab and Ademi were arrested after participating in an al-Qaeda training camp near Kabul.</para><para>Habib has not provided details as to why he was in Afghanistan, preferring to keep this a mystery, even during Channel 9's <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline><inline font-style="italic">,</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>where they paid him for half a story. The accounts of Mamdouh Habib's whereabouts over the past decade suggest a long association with figures tied to the al-Qaeda network, a keen interest in fundraising for convicted terrorist figures, and a person who has tried to recruit others to support a jihad holy war and who has a travel itinerary based around Afghanistan, which at the time was a haven for terrorists.

Mark was elected on 29 January 1994. It was appropriate that he was the member for Werriwa given that his mentor—the great Gough Whitlam—represented that seat with such distinction, including as Prime Minister in the years between 1972 and 1975. Mark Latham's service federally followed other public service, in particular his service as a local councillor on Liverpool council between 1987 and 1994 and as mayor from 1991.</para></talk.start><para>Mark had humble origins. He was proud of being a `houso'. He never shied away from being the boy from Green Valley. He was a person of ideas. He was a prolific writer. He helped write five books, most notably <inline font-style="italic">Civilising global capital: new thinking for Australian Labor</inline>. He was a great communicator verbally, and I think this was his greatest asset. He was articulate, clever, incisive, passionate and humorous. He could be tough. He was devastating on his opponents, but he could also be gentle, as he was when he spoke about his mum, and that certainly endeared him to me on a personal level. </para><para>I did not always agree with Mark's views—far from it. We had major disagreements over economic policy and social policy both within and outside the forums of the Australian Labor Party. Mark, however, was always prepared to engage in political debate. He was indeed a great political figure. Whether you agreed with him or not, he always made a difference; you noticed that Mark Latham was there, both within and outside the party.</para><para>One of his last public forums was in my electorate of Grayndler, at Leichhardt Town Hall, on Monday, 22 November last year. We sent out invitations. People thought it was rather odd that I was doorknocking just after the election. Some 600 or 700 people filled the hall—we do not know, because it was packed. Many people were turned away. He engaged on a whole range of issues. He took questions from all comers.</para><para>I did not vote for him to be leader of the Labor Party. I believed that Kim Beazley was the best prospect to win the prime ministership. But as the leader he certainly set the agenda. He had the Howard government on the run over issues such as parliamentary superannuation and the free trade agreement, where he came up with a clever and principled solution to some of the internal disagreements the Labor Party had of moving amendments to protect the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and to protect our cultural content. In the end, the government had to cave in to a Labor position. He led a principled position in opposition to the Iraq war. I marched with Mark, young Oliver and my family at the demonstration in Sydney where more than a quarter of a million people marched in favour of peace just before that war began.</para><para>It is unfortunate that Mark's career has been cut short by ill health. I wish him, his wife, Janine, and his wonderful two boys, Oliver and Isaac, all the best. Parliamentary life is very hard; it can be particularly hard on people's health. Mark has made a decision that is in the interests of himself and his family. I am sure that all parliamentarians wish him well.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Paterson Electorate: Jetstar Fleet Maintenance Base</title><page.no>111</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>111</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I advise the House of the announcement by Jetstar at Williamtown Airport on 11 February to expand the heavy maintenance hangar at Newcastle. That is an investment of $29 million. The question is: why did they take the opportunity to choose Newcastle? There was extensive lobbying for the hangar facility for the maintenance of the A320 fleet to be located in New Zealand, in Singapore, in Hong Kong or in another area of Australia. What came through was the ability of the people in the Hunter—the skill sets that we have in the Hunter.</para></talk.start><para>There are currently 82 people working in highly skilled jobs at the Jetstar facility at Newcastle airport. What is impressive is that 25 of those people are apprentices. They are committed to developing a skills base that will serve the country well. The announcement of the $29 million investment at Newcastle airport to service the A320 fleet will lead to an additional 50 jobs over five years, and I understand that more apprenticeships will be rolled out over that period. I am pleased that this will involve upskilling young people in our local area.</para><para>We also have in my electorate, on the other side of the airstrip, RAAF Base Williamtown. One of the key aspects of RAAF Base Williamtown, and it is the premier RAAF base in Australia, is that a lot of highly skilled technicians get posted there. They discover the lifestyle of the Hunter Valley. I think I am correct in saying that one of the highest exit rates from the Air Force is to Williamtown—whether or not they go to another posting afterwards, they come back to our region, to Medowie and Salamander Bay. Those high levels of skills allowed British Aerospace to set up and build the Hawk lead-in fighters. We have a magnificent facility in our region that can service, build and develop aircraft. This project will expand on that. I can remember when this hangar facility was originally started by Impulse Airlines to service the Beechcraft 1900 aircraft. When QantasLink took over Impulse Airlines the aircraft were shifted up to the B717s—a new aircraft brought into the Australian fleet—and now we are moving to the A320s. </para><para>I am concerned at the reports of an open skies agreement between Australia and Singapore. If agreed to, this agreement will see an open arrangement for Singapore Airlines to fly from the east coast of Australia to the west coast of the USA. Singapore's Minister for Transport, Mr Yew Cheow Tong, has met with our government officials this week in Canberra. He said:</para><quote><para>It will give travellers a wider choice. I think it will result in lower fares and it will bring in additional visitors into Australia ... It is good for the economy and I do think they [the government] recognise that. There is scope for a lot more tourists in Australia.</para></quote><para>I do not dispute that, but I have to stand up for the people in my electorate. I have to stand up for the skills base on which Jetstar and Qantas have made their decision to invest in my electorate. I do not want to see competition at the expense of jobs at the airport in my electorate.</para><para>Today Qantas posted its half-yearly results to 31 December. On a revenue base of $6.4 billion, it has announced a profit before tax of $601.3 million. There are competitive pressures in the airline industry, and part of that competitive pressure is to maintain a profit so that it can service the needs of its shareholders. Qantas will be establishing 400 new flight attendants, to be based out of London. If we open up our airways to other countries—countries whose airlines are subsidised by their governments—Qantas will have to look further offshore to reduce its costs. I fear that those jobs in maintenance may end up being located offshore. We had to bid strongly against New Zealand, against Hong Kong and against Singapore to have the fleet maintenance base in Australia. I say to our Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources: do not proceed with the open skies policy, because it will be to the detriment of my workers. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Sister Janet Mead of the Sisters of Mercy was last year made South Australian of the year. She accepted the honour in Glenelg, which is within the electorate of Hindmarsh. I think of Sister Mead as South Australia's very own Mother Theresa. I know that if she reads this speech she will chastise me, because her humility is also key to the way she lives her life and the work that she does. When most of us walk down the street and see a bedraggled unkempt man stumbling towards us we instantly put up all of the barriers we can. Without thinking, we see this person as different, as bad and as a danger to us, so we ignore him, pretend we do not see him and tell ourselves that there is nothing we can do to help him. We think that it is up to him to pull himself out of the life he lives and learn how to live like the rest of us. Of course that is complete rubbish; it is all about creating reasons to turn our backs on someone in need.</para></talk.start><para>Sister Janet Mead does not tell herself those sorts of lies. She spends her life with the poorest, most marginalised and most isolated people in our society. She works with the Adelaide Day Care Centre for Homeless Persons, the Brian Burdekin Clinic and Westcare. She helps homeless people overcome the tremendous challenges they face as they live their lives. The Adelaide day care centre has created a community for homeless people. Amongst other things, they can share a cooked lunch, work in the vegie garden or fix old furniture.</para><para>It is easy to misunderstand this work as some sort of sacrifice on the part of Sister Mead, but she feels fortunate to live her life in this way. She speaks of having learned so much from the people she works with. She says that she has learned a view of the world that places love above status—what a lesson for all of us whose lives are entangled in this place. Sister Mead teaches us that what she does is within reach of all of us. It is possible to find our open-heartedness and give a little, even for those who have forgotten that they ever had a soft spot. She teaches us that, in doing so, we can grow. One day we might be brave enough to give a smile to someone who scares us and another day we might be able to make a donation or buy an edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Big Issue</inline>. In doing so, we open our hearts enough to make our lives and the lives of those we love a little easier because that is what happens when we give to others without any agenda or any expectation of getting something back.</para><para>Sister Janet Mead says she reaps the most amazing rewards from the people she works with. She tells a story of a homeless man who told her, `Life's journey is not to arrive at the grave safely in a well-preserved body but to skid in sideways, totally worn out, shouting “Holy hell, what a ride!”' We have all had the good fortune at one time or another to meet someone whose generosity and openness could make us realise that something was not quite right in our lives. Sister Janet Mead is one of those people. For all the fear that we put in the space between ourselves and anyone else who we perceive to be different from us, Sister Janet Mead teaches that we are fooling ourselves and tricking ourselves out of learning that when we ignore suffering we contribute to it.</para><para>As a society we have a great deal to learn about becoming a community. Increasingly people are finding that the teachings of Christianity can help us to connect with our world, but as we do that we must be watchful that we do not close off from others who we perceive to have lost their way. When we do help those people we must be watchful that we do not define Christian values too narrowly because, as Sister Janet Mead demonstrates each day, Jesus Christ would have turned his back on no-one. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Hinkler Electorate</title><page.no>114</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>114</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Honourable members would know I am not one easily given to hubris, but I would like to highlight the clearest possible demonstration of a turnaround of fortunes of two sectors of my electorate of Hinkler in Central Queensland. Since the Howard government came to office there have been huge improvements in national indicators such as unemployment, interest rates and inflation. We are now seeing this filter down into areas which have had endemic levels of unemployment in the past.</para></talk.start><para>My electorate of Hinkler, and for that matter the entire Wide Bay-Burnett region, is one such area. But the Wide Bay-Burnett region has experienced the biggest percentage drop in unemployment in Australia in the past 12 months, and my electorate has just had the best percentage increase in bulk-billing rates in Queensland and one of the best in Australia over the last 12 months. Wide Bay-Burnett's unemployment rate now sits at six per cent, down a full 3.6 per cent in December 2004 from December 2003. Over the same period, employment numbers, now at 99,100, increased by 10.4 per cent—a remarkable figure. This can be clearly attributed to sound economic management of the nation, which has given businesses the confidence to invest in regional areas and to provide much needed local employment.</para><para>The region has also gone ahead in the health sphere, with Hinkler's bulk-billing rate going up by 12.8 per cent between December 2003 and December 2004, and it now stands at 60.5 per cent. This might not seem significant to many members but consider this: Hinkler's bulk-billing rate has gone up by 16.9 per cent since 2002 when, in many other parts of the nation, it went down. I am confident we will see further improvements because we have not yet seen the full effect of the coalition's additional $7.65 payment for concession card holders and children under 16 or the annual impact of the doctors being paid the full schedule fee.</para><para>These two indicators fly in the face of the ALP's doom and gloom message that they put out in my electorate during the election campaign. It is the clearest possible demonstration that they were wrong. The area has often been targeted as one of the worst unemployment areas in Australia; it had endemic unemployment. We now see the electorate, as a result of our economic management, coming out of that. I congratulate the government on its focus and on behalf of my electors I thank the government for the improvements that have made an area that was very much challenged in past years a better one. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Dental Services</title><page.no>114</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>114</page.no><name role="metadata">Bird, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BIRD</name><name.id>DZP</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Some questions need to be seriously asked at this point in time and in this place.

The program reduced waiting lists and gave those in our community who could least afford it the opportunity to access dental health services that can reasonably be expected to be available in a modern first-world country. When times get a bit tough, the government is often quick to blame the states, but a cursory glance at section 51 of the Constitution shows that the powers of the federal government extend to dental services. I am sure they would not want to give away other sections of section 51, such as trade, tax, telephones and trademarks, so why the flick pass on dental health? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Flinders Electorate: Education and Training</title><page.no>115</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>115</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to talk today about the potential for technical college education within and servicing the electorate of Flinders. I want to set out the need, the opportunity and the steps forward. The need is very clear. The technical college education at state level has largely been failing young people on the Mornington Peninsula, at the top of Westernport and on Bass Coast. That is a result of changes made over a decade ago, but the gaps are there. In the towns of Hastings and Koo Wee Rup and on the Bass Coast there is a young population with needs to develop skills, be they in welding, plumbing, some form of manufacturing, engineering, marine, maritime or IT.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to that need, there are two very clear proposals which I wish to present to the House today. The first is for a technical college, under the Australian technical college system, based in the south-east of Melbourne. That college would have, at the very least, two annexes which are relevant to my electorate. The first of those would be an annex in the town of Hastings, under the Australian technical college proposal, in conjunction with Westernport Secondary College. This is something to which I am committed and for which I want to fight. What I believe about this is that if an annex of an Australian technical college were constructed at Westernport Secondary College, the opportunity would exist to help students with a marine and maritime focus to cooperate with BlueScope Steel, the Mornington Peninsula Shire, Westernport Secondary and all of the maritime related companies and firms within the area. I think that, in conjunction with a campus at Pakenham servicing Koo Wee Rup, Clyde, Devon Meadows and Lang Lang, which would have a building and agricultural focus, this is a tremendous opportunity. </para><para>The second part of the proposal is to service the Bass Coast region through the town of Wonthaggi. I believe that there is potential for an annex for a Gippsland based Australian technical college. The government is committed to a Gippsland based Australian technical college. My argument, in conjunction with Russell Broadbent, the member for McMillan, is that we should push to have some representation through a local annex in Wonthaggi. That would be a tremendous boost for the people of Phillip Island, San Remo, Granville, the hills areas, Dalyston, Kilcunda and Wonthaggi. I put those two proposals on the table. I endorse them and I am going to fight for them.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Australia: Population</title><page.no>116</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>116</page.no><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GRIERSON</name><name.id>00AMP</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to draw the House's attention to the declining birth rates in regional Australia, particularly in the Hunter-New England region, in which my electorate of Newcastle is located. The latest figures show that between 1999 and 2003 the number of mothers giving birth per year in the Hunter-New England region fell by 4.7 per cent. Statewide the figure fell by 1.1 per cent. That means the number of mothers giving birth in our region is declining more than four times faster than it is in the rest of the state. Sadly, this trend is evident in other regions of New South Wales. If it continues, regions do face the danger of terminal decline and Australia is in danger of losing one of the most important aspects of its identity.</para></talk.start><para>For a government whose junior partner is The Nationals, it is shameful that the regions do face annihilation. For a government that prides itself on family values, we have seen precious few policies to assist regional families or sustain rural and regional communities. Young people move away to gain education and do not return. Job insecurity drives people to the cities, and skills and knowledge disappear with them. Health and disability services dwindle, and the increasing costs of isolation and distance continue unchecked. Vital infrastructure that links regional communities and provides expanded market opportunities is neglected or removed. And what is the first off the block in the reform agenda of this newly re-elected government? We have had a hypocritical moral values debate about abortion, tighter wages control through a new industrial relations regime, tax cuts for the wealthy and competition deregulation that will make it harder for small business. What we do need are clever policy ideas and reform that boost productivity by sustaining regional economies, by supporting family friendly workplaces and by reducing the economic barriers to having children—not the same tired old agenda that the government will be bringing back and ramming through the Senate from July.</para><para>The Rural Doctors Association of Australia tells us that the number of GP obstetricians in New South Wales has halved since 1996. In fact the greatest medical work force shortages are in regional Australia. Recent estimates of the cost of seeing a child born last year through education from preschool to university suggest a price tag of $200,000. If you add the cost for regional parents of sending their children away for education, it will be even more. Expenditure per child-care place under the Howard government has dropped by a massive 10.2 per cent, and now we find that parents will not see a cent of the promised 30 per cent rebate on child-care fees until the 2006-07 financial year. </para><para>The essentials of raising children have become much more difficult under the Howard government. Is it any wonder then that the Australian Institute of Family Studies reports that one of the main factors dissuading people from starting a family is economic insecurity. Yet the report also found that 90 per cent of people surveyed want to have children. We must get our family policies right, especially in our regions, to allow people to fulfil their parenting dreams. The Howard government's cynical regional rorts scheme may have bought it another term in government, but it will never be a substitute for the real policies needed to help families in regional Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Bulk-Billing</title><page.no>117</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>117</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The member for Newcastle is quite correct when she points out that the declining birth rate is one of the challenges that we face as a nation. The combination of the ageing population and the declining birth rate present policy challenges which this government has commenced to addressed. I do, however, wonder where the member for Newcastle stands on the issue of the Medicare funding of abortions, which is of course a conscience vote—as it should be—in this place. The fact that we have 100,000 abortions in this country each year no doubt does move in some direction towards reducing the national birth rate. However, I did not rise in this chamber to talk about that particular topic at this time.</para></talk.start><para>I am pleased to announce that the bulk-billing rate in my electorate of Fisher has continued to rise as a result of the Howard government's investment in Medicare and is now at 70.2 per cent. The bulk-billing rate in Fisher increased 10.3 percentage points in 2004 compared with 2003. This latest increase shows that the Howard government's investment in Medicare is delivering more affordable GP services for everyone living on the Sunshine Coast and in surrounding regions. This increase in Fisher reflects the national trend. The health minister has done a wonderful job in helping to boost the rate of bulk-billing. The national GP bulk-billing rate is at its highest level in 2½ years. The rate increased again during the December quarter 2004 and is now 72.4 per cent, an increase of 5.9 percentage points since the government introduced its Medicare package a year ago. The national GP bulk-billing rate for people 65 years of age and over also increased during the December quarter to its highest level in almost four years of 82.7 per cent, an increase of 8.7 percentage points on the December quarter of 2003.</para><para>Locally, as well as nationally, more than seven out of 10 GP attendances are being bulk-billed, and across the nation more than eight out of 10 GP attendances for people over 65 are being bulk-billed. This is the first time in 10 years that the national bulk-billing rate has increased over four successive quarters. GPs who bulk-bill Commonwealth concession card holders and children under 16 receive an extra $5.10 or $7.65, depending on their location. This is in addition to a recent increase in the Medicare rebate to $30.85. GPs now have more incentive to bulk-bill their patients—for example, if a GP in Tasmania bulk-bills a concession card holder or child then he or she will receive $38.50. This compares with a rate of $25.70 in November 2003. Since the introduction of bulk-billing incentives, all states and territories have experienced an increase in GP bulk-billing rates. In my state of Queensland, the most wonderful part of the country in which to live, the bulk-billing rate has increased by 7.6 percentage points to 69.3 per cent. The government do have the recipe right. We are delivering for Australians, particularly those Australians who are fortunate enough to live on Queensland's wonderful Sunshine Coast. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Paterson's curse is a weed which, no doubt, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, in your role as a rural member, you would only too well understand. It is a noxious weed to livestock. It spreads like another suburban weed, lantana—and like lantana its flowers are purple. When you see a field of it off in the distance and do not know what it is, you might think it is rather picturesque. But, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a curse.</para></talk.start><para>It is a curse because it is virtually impossible to get rid of and it can kill off your livestock. Paterson's curse also applied to the federal seat of Paterson, which, since it was recreated in 1993, had not been won by the sitting member once. Last year, I broke politics' Paterson's curse. I want to recognise that there are many new members in this parliament and I want to remark on the people that they have replaced. When I was voted out in 1998 it took me a long time to come to terms with failure. For the first time I had to take a long hard look at what I did when I was the member for Paterson. I have done that again this time around and I can honestly say it is much nicer to analyse the results from my current position, as opposed to the position I was in after the election in 1998.</para><para>We in the coalition showed that elections in marginal seats do not start when the election is called—they run over the entire term. We—my staff and I—worked very hard to attract more funding, better services and better representation over the entire three-year period. We never gave up fighting for the things that were important to the people in Paterson. It is a fight we will continue over the next term of this government and beyond. We have a hunger to improve services and get more funding for areas such as aged care, roads and health.</para><para>Paterson has four local government areas in its boundaries: Port Stephens, Dungog, Gloucester, and Great Lakes, as well as small parts of the cities of Maitland and Newcastle. Two of these areas are coastal, two are rural and the parts of Maitland and Newcastle are regional, almost urban. The coastal communities are largely made up of retirees. The bay areas of Fullerton Cove, Stockton Bight, Fingal Bay, Shoal Bay, Nelson Bay, Salamander Bay, Tanilba Bay and Lemon Tree Passage are attracting more affluent retirees. In Foster-Tuncurry in the north the retirees are not as affluent as they are in the south. Statistics show they are about five years older on average than their counterparts in the lower part of the electorate. The Maitland area, including Thornton and Morpeth, is a more prosperous area. Thornton is one of the fastest growing suburbs in the state and there are many young families in the suburb. </para><para>Beresfield, Woodbury and Tarro are older suburbs that are affordable for low-income earners and still in an area which is close to health, transport and education facilities. The shire of Gloucester is a farming area for mainly dairy and beef. Farmers have done it tough over the past two years or so, with many experiencing hardship as a result of the drought and dairy deregulation. Every small town along the Bucketts Way—Limeburners Creek, Allworth, Booral, Stroud, Stroud Road, Wards River, Craven and Stratford—has a popular hall, a voting place and a need for better roads, schools and, indeed, basic access to health care. Every small community along the Pacific Highway, whether it be Karuah, North Arm Cove, Tea Gardens, Hawks Nest, Nerong, Bulahdelah, Wootton, Coolongolook or Nabiac, has a hall, church or a meeting place. These communities may have a rural fire service or a church volunteer group. They may have a popular hall which is maintained by a small number of hardworking community committees.</para><para>The results for Paterson in the 2004 election varied from a primary vote swing to me of two per cent in the areas which were traditionally liberal to around 12 per cent in the areas which I would have considered Labor heartland. I am deeply humbled by the result. Although the election was in October last year this has been my first opportunity in the parliament to thank those who have helped me in the campaign. We expect our staff to know a little about a lot of things. We expect them to know about tax, telecommunications and Centrelink, to have a good local knowledge of our electorates, to keep us informed and on time and to get us to the right place. We ask them to work incredibly long hours during the sitting weeks and the non-sitting weeks. Then we back up and expect them to put in three times the effort during an election.</para><para>I want to personally thank my staff—Mike, Anna and Julia—for being such a tremendous support to me and our community over the past years. I also want to thank my campaign team for their tremendous work: Bob Geoghegan, the campaign director and John Murphy, the treasurer. On the advisory team I want to thank Josh Hodges, Sally Dover, Michelle Moffatt, Daryl Lewis and Peter West. I want to thank Sally Dover's husband, Gary, and Alan Ray for driving my mobile office around the electorate for me when Daryl could not. And thank you to Alan's better half, Marty Ray, for keeping him company. It was a sad day when the mobile office rolled and was written off a week out from polling day. But, within days, I had a replacement on the road to make sure the people did not forget me and were not denied access.</para><para>On polling day, there were around 600 people working for me in the electorate of Paterson, and I sincerely thank them for all their help. I cannot name them all in the time allowed, but there are some community leaders that I would like to thank—Ross Presgrave; Margaret Godsmark; Gerry Jermon; Sue Slater; Jan McWilliams; Peter Mason and his wife, Anne Mason; Trevor and Jacquie Wark; Sean and Robyn Brennan—who have all become community leaders through the Port Stephens crime forum work. Doreen Bradley, a natural leader in her community who has been recognised with an OAM, has become a great supporter because we stood up and fought for the issues that were important to her and her community.</para><para>I would like to thank the Young Liberals team, who letterboxed the hilliest parts of our electorate. My thanks also go out to the former state director, Scott Morrison, who managed the state secretariat better than it had ever been managed before. We will miss you. At the end, I owe especial thanks to my brothers and sisters in Christ in the Raymond Terrace Christian Life Centre, in particular my pastors, Colin Haddow and Rod Smith. All members in this House need the support of their families, and my especial thanks go to my wife, Cynthia, who gives me unconditional support, my twin sons, David and Robbie—I had the proudest moment last Sunday in witnessing their first parade as naval cadets from training ship <inline font-style="italic">Tobruk</inline>—and of course my daughter, Samantha. I thank them all. </para><para>Now that we are well and truly on our way in this new term of government, I want to highlight some of the issues that we are fighting for in Paterson. Firstly, I will address the issue of schools and RAAF Base Williamtown. Salt Ash Public School in my electorate is affected by aircraft noise from the RAAF weapons range at Salt Ash. This has been the case for a number of years, which is why it was a ridiculous state of affairs when the New South Wales government had just completed building a new classroom without noise amelioration. The Minister for Defence and I announced that we would fix the New South Wales government's botched job and build a new library, this time with appropriate noise insulation. The Salt Ash Weapons Range has had a significant impact on the learning of children at that school and also the Williamtown Public School, for which I have also successfully lobbied for amelioration measures.</para><para>In the case of other schools in my area, the P&amp;Cs are almost tearing their hair out, trying to get the right facilities for their children. Grahamstown Public School was built only 10 years ago by the state government, long after the base was built, so it included noise attenuation measures. But it was built without airconditioning. This means that in summer they cannot shut the doors because it is too hot, and in the winter they cannot shut the doors because the fumes from the gas heater are dangerous. That is why I am so pleased that the public schools will now be able to apply directly to the Australian government for funds instead of going through the state government, as a part of our $700 million package. This means that Grahamstown Public School P&amp;C can apply for funding for airconditioning directly from the Australian government and not worry about the New South Wales education department deeming it not to be a priority.</para><para>The P&amp;Cs of all of the schools in my electorate, whether they be in Dungog, Medowie, Gloucester, Stroud Road, Forster or Bulahdelah, to mention a few, can apply for funding. Last year, we faced the hottest November on record, yet the roll-out program for airconditioning in schools is over four or five years. But, for the first time, parents and teachers do not have to worry about any roll-out program developed by an overpaid policy officer in an airconditioned office in Sydney. We will deliver results.</para><para>The other issue I would like to raise in relation to education is my continued push for a high school in the Medowie-Tilligerry area. Finally, we have the state government waking up to the fact that this is a growing and developing area, with a number of students, that will support the existence of a high school.</para><para>Turning my attention now to health matters in my electorate, I received letters of congratulation from a pensioner in Salamander Bay. I sorted out a Medicare matter for him earlier in the year, and in the process of the correspondence he made some remarks about politicians and how we do not look after our constituents. I did not hear anything from this pensioner until about one week after the election, when he wrote to me and thanked me for my help. He said he voted for me on the back of that help. I was flummoxed, because I thought he had voted informal or, worse, for a minor party. </para><para>His comments about bulk-billing and the cost of visiting a doctor helped me give the Prime Minister and health minister feedback on what we should do with Medicare. Even though bulk-billing has risen from 53.3 per cent to 59.7 per cent, no doctors are bulk-billing in the bay area, and a policy which did not recognise bulk-billing black spots would not work. People would have to change doctors to get the benefit of a policy. A full rebate will work for people like Claude.</para><para>I mentioned that in the top end of my electorate there were many who are considered frail aged. One of my volunteers, Richard, who did some letterboxing for me, is 78 years of age. But he is one of the many older Australians who no longer drives but walks everywhere. Some older drivers elect to have a restricted licence which gets them to the nearest business district. I want to thank the health minister for recognising this mobility issue and announcing a Medicare office for the Forster-Tuncurry area. Richard will now be able to walk to the Medicare office to claim his rebate.</para><para>But there are still holes in the health service in this area. We need public hospital facilities in the Great Lakes area, and I will keep on pushing our state government for some action. We have a private hospital in Forster called Cape Hawke Hospital. It has a complete floor of beds waiting to be developed. It defies logic why the state government will not enter into an arrangement to lease these beds to provide access for all in our community. The state government seem to think that hospital facilities in Taree are adequate for the burgeoning population in Forster-Tuncurry, Smiths Lakes and the Pacific Palms areas, but they simply do not understand. In the lower part of my electorate, Port Stephens desperately needs a hospital, but the New South Wales government will not even fund a feasibility study into whether the population in this area warrants a fully fledged hospital. The polyclinic at Nelson Bay, like our local schools, has had to fundraise to get airconditioning.</para><para>Turning my attention to telephones, we clearly want to improve communications in communities like Hawkes Nest, Tea Gardens, Vasey and Gresford. They need the internet to do business, both with business and the government. They need reliable landlines in case of emergencies and a mobile phone service that is not full of patches. A reliable communications service via the internet and a phone is just as vital in rural communities as good roads. In fact, I would argue that reliable internet and telephone services are more vital in towns further away from the city than they are in the city itself. I am not sure if many people in city electorates are aware of this, but some milk manufacturers now expect dairy farmers to submit their tenders via the internet. Any city member who argues that you cannot realistically expect a city-quality service in the bush should tell that to the milk manufacturers.</para><para>The difference between high-speed internet access and dial-up could be worth tens of thousands of dollars to a dairy farmer. I say this emphatically because areas such as Dungog and Gloucester have done it tough with deregulation. I would like to commend the former minister for communications and the current minister for continuing to upgrade the facilities to provide the internet to rural areas and for continuing to fix mobile telephone black spots. The geography of my electorate consists of hills and valleys. This causes mobile phone black spots, and both Vasey and Gresford have had new mobile phone towers switched on.</para><para>If there is one issue in my electorate that used to cause a huge amount of frustration with my constituents, and in some places it still does, it is that of television reception. For many of the elderly in my electorate television is their only source of entertainment and information. It sounds a bit fickle but, if a retiree is 80 and bedridden, this is the only form of entertainment and information that they have. For everyone else, staying in touch via the news or watching one or two favourite programs a year is all they expect. Earlier this year the new television booster tower for Stroud was switched on. It is still being adjusted to ensure a perfect picture every time, but at least it is up. Funding has been approved for similar towers in Booral, Elizabeth Beach and Smiths Lakes, which are operational. Funding of almost $750,000 was announced in mid-2004 for a television tower for the bay area in my electorate. It is a project that I am committed to. I will keep lobbying all of the stakeholders until we have the digital retransmission facility established on Gan Gan Hill. </para><para>In the area of aged care I am determined to get more aged care beds and funding for my electorate as a part of the government's roll-out of beds over the next three years. The minister for ageing has done a tremendous job since taking over this portfolio, continuing the work of former ministers and ensuring this area is well funded to support the growing needs throughout Australia. Many people come to retire in my electorate. The provision of aged care services that they may need in later years is an important part of their decision to move to communities such as Forster-Tuncurry and Port Stephens. If a person needs a nursing home they want to get into one near their families and friends. This is critically important.</para><para>I would also like to express my absolute zeal for bed places for couples. After years of marriage, raising a family and spending every night together, it is right that people can spend their nursing home days together too. The number of aged care places in the electorate of Paterson has doubled under the Howard government. Over the next three years it will increase substantially, with 940 places to be distributed in the Hunter region and 765 to be distributed in the mid North Coast region as part of the government's $2.2 billion Investing in Australia's Aged Care: More Places, Better Care Program.</para><para>We have had developments open up in the past six months, including the Port Stephens Gardens Nursing Centre in Salamander Bay, which is a 120-bed facility, and the opening of the Kularoo Gardens expansion in Forster. In the near future we hope to see Barclay Gardens in Tuncurry open, the expansion of the Myall Lodge in Hawks Nest, the expansion of the Great Lakes Nursing Home in Bulahdelah and the expansion of the Lara Aged Care Facility in Dungog—not forgetting the recently opened expansion of the GLAICA nursing home in Tuncurry.</para><para>I will continue to fight for one of the most important issues in my electorate, and that is roads. I have fought for a great deal of funding for projects in my electorate, such as the $20 million investment in Buckett's Way and the $25 million investment for Weakley's Drive. These projects, when completed, will bring great benefits to many communities. No-one should underestimate the importance of improved roads to the economies of regional areas. There are roads in the Dungog Shire—about which Mayor Steve Low and I have spoken on many occasions—which council cannot afford to fix on their current income. To make matters worse, they are ineligible for state government funding for particular roads.</para><para>Then there is the popular tourist route of Lakes Way, which links the Pacific Highway and Forster-Tuncurry with communities such as Pacific Palms and Smiths Lake. Tourist operators have told me how they tell motorists to take the alternative Pacific Highway route, instead of the scenic Lake's Way, because of concerns for their safety. To assist councils that cover these particular roads, the Australian government made a commitment during the election for $10 million to be spread across the Dungog, Port Stephens and Great Lakes shires, a commitment which must be matched by the state government. I have written to the New South Wales Minister for Roads, Michael Costa, about this project and the need for their support. I am hoping that he will take up our offer and improve the roads in my electorate. </para><para>In conclusion, health, communications, aged care and roads are just some of the issues I will continue to fight for in Paterson in this term of government. This is my first consecutive term as a member of parliament, and I want to let my constituents know that I am just as motivated this time as I was the very first day I was elected to this parliament. I would like to thank the people of Paterson for putting their faith in me, and everyone—from staff to volunteers—who has helped me along the way. It is an honour to represent the people of Paterson in this place of government, and that honour should never be treated lightly. I will give them the service that not only they expect but, more importantly, they deserve.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>123</page.no><name role="metadata">Stone, Dr Sharman, MP</name><name role="display">Dr STONE</name><name.id>EM6</name.id><electorate>Murray</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to use this opportunity today to talk about some very serious issues affecting the Australian economy. We all know that Australia has traditionally addressed skills shortages through mass migration programs. From the 1950s, public infrastructure—for example, the huge Snowy Mountains scheme—was built using migrant labour, with many individuals, but also families, moving away from the war-torn zones of the Northern Hemisphere. Those people—they were often skilled but some were not skilled—worked initially on a whole range of government supported programs before moving into the wider economy. As we know, the original migrants who came in that period and their descendents form the backbone of our society today.</para></talk.start><para>We are very grateful for the mix and the cultural diversity that that migration wave brought, especially to areas like the great Goulburn and Murray valleys in my electorate, which are probably two of the most multiracial and multicultural communities in Australia. We are proud of that. That diversity has brought a richness of culture and resulted in a tolerant society. Our economy has been built on the hard work of these people, who have come to this country often with nothing more than a cardboard suitcase and a will to work.</para><para>Today Australia shares with most other developed economies a significant and growing shortage of skilled workers. This is a problem that is acknowledged throughout the OECD. Over a million skilled Australians—mostly younger people—are working offshore, taking opportunities for professional advancement, perhaps with better pay. Certainly it is a chance for them to develop their careers, but we hope they will come back. On the other side of the coin, Australia depends on the flow from other countries of, in particular, health service professionals. Most rural and regional hospitals, particularly those in the public hospital system and certainly those in my part of the world, depend on overseas trained doctors. For example, over 70 per cent of the doctors in Goulburn Valley Health, which is the main Shepparton public hospital, are from overseas. They are very welcome and we appreciate their presence. Our health services would collapse without them.</para><para>Successive Australian governments have tackled the skills shortages. I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks the mass migrations of the fifties and a little before then. No government has as conscientiously and successfully tackled the skills shortages, especially for rural and regional Australia, as the Howard government. I commend in particular the Regional Skilled Migration Scheme and the recent changes which have allowed offshore students to stay in Australia, under certain careful criteria, if they have employment in a rural area. I commend the Howard government for understanding that we need skilled migrants to come into this country and work in rural and regional Australia. </para><para>What I am equally concerned about is the unskilled labour category, comprising those who are prepared to do manual work, particularly the seasonal manual work that is absolutely essential for our horticulture industry, in which I include vegetables, nursery production, fruit and nuts and some viticulture. Some vines are able to be machine picked. In 2000, the gross value of production of horticulture was $5.5 billion, with a farm gate value of $4.7 billion. This production is dependent on access to labour in the form of pickers, pruners, planters and people who are prepared to work in packing sheds. This is seasonal work. Unfortunately farm enterprises typically cannot afford, or do not have the work, to offer jobs for a whole season. There is often a peak period in which they require a certain number of pickers—in the case of the Goulburn Valley, some 8,000 to 10,000 pickers and, in the following months, about half that number to do pruning. Without that labour, quite simply our horticultural industries cannot expand. They cannot take advantage of the growing access to the fresh fruit and vegetable, nut and honey markets that we have worked hard to develop access to.</para><para>We have a serious issue of illegal workers in the harvest areas. As we speak, a number of raids are going on in my electorate of Murray and in the neighbouring electorate of Mallee. Just two days ago some 40 or so illegal workers were picked up on some vegetable farms. Those workers came from Cambodia, Thailand and other near neighbours in Asia. They were cutting and harvesting vegetables—a high-value crop for domestic and export markets. Those farmers, those property owners, now have no labour. Those crops will need to be ploughed in. They cannot obtain additional or alternative labour. Of course they were not aware that those people were illegal. Some of them had been employed for over four years and they had been obtained through a contract labour hire service. It was the understanding of the farmers that those workers had the right to work in Australia. Sadly, it turns out they did not. Of course the owners of those properties do not support illegal work in Australia. On the other hand, they are faced with this extraordinary dilemma. How do they produce magnificent product in regions where the irrigation infrastructure has been built at public expense over a hundred years, where they have the soils, the climate and the clean green image? All is there for them to prosper but they cannot obtain the labour.</para><para>A number of countries, particularly many of our competitors in agricultural production, have overcome this problem with visas and market labour programs that bring in seasonal workers. Most countries have temporary worker programs for both high- and low-skilled workers. Some have separate programs for IT professionals, health-care workers, managers and executives, but there are special programs for farm workers—and also for maids and caregivers in some countries. There is always a concern in Australia that an overseas worker might literally `disappear' into the economy after their visa expires, because we are such a multiracial, multicultural society and we have such a huge continent. Obviously compliance issues are very difficult in Australia because we are such an open country in terms of movement. But other countries have come up with some quite careful and workable solutions—obviously negotiated with the home country and with the workers themselves. The negotiations have included such conditions as withholding part of their payments—this is of course with the workers' permission—until they are literally on their way back to their home country; not having families arrive with the workers but just having individuals come so that there is a greater incentive for them to return; and compliance with a temporary work visa creating the opportunity to return year after year, for perhaps six or nine months of the year, to work as a seasonal worker. </para><para>While I am talking about horticulture—fruit growing, vegetable growing, nuts, harvesting and table grapes—the same issues also affect Australia's hospitality industry, where there is a chronic shortage of workers, and our rag trade. But let me focus at the moment on the issue that most significantly affects my electorate, which is the access to labour for horticulture. I want to mention a couple of programs used by other countries. Canada, for example, has the Commonwealth Caribbean and Mexican Agricultural Seasonal Workers Program, or ASWP. It has allowed Canadian farmers to import foreign workers for up to eight months a year from the Caribbean since 1966 and from Mexico since 1974. About 80 per cent of these ASWP migrants are employed in fruit, vegetable and tobacco farms in Ontario. Their average stay in Canada is four months.</para><para>Mexicans are recruited and employed under the terms of a government-to-government memorandum of understanding that makes the Mexican Ministry of Labor responsible for recruiting workers and negotiating their wages with Human Resources Development Canada, a government agency. The admissions process begins with farm employers applying to local Human Resources centres for certification to employ the foreign workers, at least eight weeks before they are needed. There is, of course, always a preference for Canadian workers under the Canadians First policy, but if there is evidence that no Canadian nationals are available then farmers may access these foreign workers. They must pay them an agreed piece rate or the prevailing wage.</para><para>There can be absolutely no intention of exploiting labour from countries where salaries or piece work payments may be substantially lower than in the Australian economy. Their housing, their access to health services and every other condition of their work must be equivalent to Australian working standards. There must be no possibility of exploitation of these people. In the Canadian experience, migrants are given entry papers in their countries of origin, and a special Foreign Agricultural Resource Management Services agency affiliate arranges to transport these workers to Canada and to the employer who has applied for them. Farmers advance the cost of transportation from Mexico to Canada and deduct four per cent of workers' wages to cover the transport costs. Farmers also deduct payroll taxes and insurance costs from their workers' pay, and there is a 14-day probation period after their arrival.</para><para>Other countries have similar sorts of programs. Swiss programs, for example, are long established, and indeed that country totally depends on foreign workers. In December 2001, foreigners in the Swiss work force represented 25 per cent of all workers. Of those, 20 per cent had renewable one-year work permits and 18 per cent were border commuters. Switzerland's agriculture based industries could not continue without these workers, but there are certain conditions of compliance associated with their programs.</para><para>With regard to the French programs, the numbers of seasonal foreign workers admitted for employment in agriculture rise and fall. In 1972 a peak of 138,000 seasonal foreign workers were admitted into France. Two-thirds came from Spain; two-thirds were employed to do the grape harvest. The admission process began with French farmers having their need for foreign workers certified by local labour officers. Spanish workers were then requested by name by French employers, and many arrived by train in work crews that could shift from employer to employer. French employers paid for worker transportation and provided housing. It has been noted that the recruitment of seasonal foreign workers for agriculture was not halted with the recruitment of foreign workers who came in for other purposes. There has been a shrinking and expanding of the need for workers in France for agriculture, but in the late 1990s almost 11,000 seasonal foreign workers were admitted. In fact, in 2001, there were 11,000 seasonal workers for agriculture; half came from Morocco and 43 per cent came from Poland. </para><para>I want to emphasise the success of programs in other countries. Many of us are also aware of the longstanding guest worker programs in countries such as the United States, in particular—and I have already mentioned Canada. They have a very well-known program where they try very hard to ensure the rights of workers and to ensure that those who come through the borders illegally are not exploited but, rather, go through a legal process. That gives the farmers access to seasonal work, which means that the Californian industries have survived and thrived, many of them in competition with Australia's agribusiness.</para><para>Israel also has a longstanding worker program, where teams of workers arrive from the Middle East and other neighbouring countries for only, on some occasions, four months of work on their kibbutzim to meet the seasonal peaks of their horticultural demand. The workers return with apparently very little loss in terms of overstaying. Israel's horticultural industry's prosperity is linked to their access to this labour.</para><para>I have been speaking to our Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. She is very aware of this problem and is concerned about making sure that we have immigration programs in Australia that do not lead to overstaying or exploitation. We, of course, have sex industry problems in Australia, where illegal workers are brought into this country. Women are very significantly exploited when this happens, but we have introduced sex slavery legislation into this House to ensure that we can properly prosecute those who use illegal workers in our country in the sex industry.</para><para>These are very serious issues associated with guest workers that I know our government is keen to address and will address. I want to make the point, however, that enforcing compliance, with the so-called raids that are undertaken in horticulture to find illegal workers, is costly. Perhaps the cost is more than that of administering a scheme of introduced seasonal workers where the rules are very carefully thought through. If we take the very best of the systems that have been introduced overseas, we can then solve a number of problems. We can have our multibillion dollar horticultural industry thrive and our export industries grow. We can remove the incentive for illegal overstays, and we can perhaps build on our relationships with our near neighbours, particularly in Asian countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, who have numbers of workers only too willing to come to Australia for short terms. We can build relationships further, with close connections between certain districts and regions in those countries and our horticultural regions in Australia. The need is very great, and I know we will find a solution. I look forward to working with the minister in developing a solution to this problem. I want to say that the John Howard government is one of the first to be serious about regional employment issues, and I commend the skilled migration programs that are bringing us workers for the first time in decades. But the seasonal worker program now needs serious attention. </para><para>Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (10.35 a.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That further proceedings be conducted in the House</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>INDIAN OCEAN TSUNAMI</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>127</page.no></debateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 8 February, on motion by<inline font-weight="bold"> Mr Pearce</inline>:</para><motion><para>That the House take note of the document.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>127</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellis, Annette, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ANNETTE ELLIS</name><name.id>5K6</name.id><electorate>Canberra</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to have this opportunity to add my voice to those in this and the other place who have already expressed their deep shock and sadness at the events of 26 December 2004. When the death toll was estimated in the thousands, I was shocked by the magnitude of the disaster. As the number of victims increased with every hour, day and news bulletin, my shock, and that of others, turned to utter disbelief. I fear that the final human cost of this disaster will never be truly known. Having spent 2½ years in Bangkok during my time with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade some years ago, I have a very deep affection and respect for the people of Thailand. There is no way to describe the sadness I feel at the thought of such a warm people, so generous in nature and rich in culture, having such a tragedy inflicted upon them. Sadly, they were not the only country so afflicted.</para></talk.start><para>Sections of the Australian and international communities have expressed in a variety of ways their support for those affected. Very soon after 26 December, I had the opportunity and the privilege here in my electorate of Canberra to attend interfaith services at the Royal Thai Embassy; St Christopher's Catholic Church, in Manuka; the City Uniting Church; the Indonesian Embassy; and the Mandir Society, in Mawson. I was immensely impressed by the level of attendance, given that one of those services was held on the morning of 1 January, New Year's Day, at a time when everybody was very much in holiday mode. Yet, when these services came along and offered an opportunity for people to gather, it became very evident that people really needed to do that. For my own part I appreciated very much the efforts behind each of those services that I attended. I understood very clearly, from my own personal feelings, the importance of gathering. Sitting at home and watching the news was one thing, but I cannot overstate how important it was to have the opportunity to get together with other people, some of whom were personally affected through family connections in some of the countries affected.</para><para>The tsunami did not respect national borders, ethnic, cultural or political differences. The water claimed the lives of people from many different religions, backgrounds and nationalities. The response to this catastrophe has been that the geographic and cultural barriers disregarded by the tsunami are also being disregarded by those seeking to support and to help repair the damage. As each country affected by the rising water began to assess the enormous task of rebuilding, in this country alone churches, synagogues, mosques, scout groups, schools, pubs, workplaces, sporting groups, neighbourhoods—every level of our society—began fundraising. I know all members of this House will join me in saying that we were both amazed and pleased by the level of generosity shown by Canberra residents and the generosity that has been mirrored around the country.</para><para>It is interesting to note that money was collected from such huge events as WaveAid right down to children collecting in their neighbourhood streets. It was a response we have never needed to see before, but it warms the heart to know that it happened. I would like to express my support, as others in this place have already, for the measures taken by the Australian government in response to the events of 26 December. I would also like to thank the government departments and individuals whose reaction to this crisis can make us all so proud. </para><para>Many Canberra residents returned early from their hard-earned leave as government departments reacted to the disaster. Being the national capital, Canberra is also home to the majority of Commonwealth public servants in this country. It is fair to say, and I do not think anybody will mind me reflecting in this way, that it can sometimes be fashionable to knock public servants—and I do not mean just politicians; I mean anybody around the country. It is quite often a bit of sport. However, the reaction of those people working in all areas of the Public Service over that period might put that kind of practice to bed for ever. There has never been a better demonstration of absolute dedication to a job or to providing a service than was seen at all levels of the public service sector following this terrible disaster.</para><para>Acting to help seems to have been an automatic reaction to the crisis rather than a conscious decision. These people simply saw what was required and went to work to respond. In the days following 26 December, the people at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade worked tirelessly to provide information to Australians seeking news of loved ones in the affected regions. To put things into perspective, I am informed that shortly after the Bali bombing the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade received around 35,000 calls. By 10 January this year, that same call centre had received over 82,000 calls, an enormous level of response and work required.</para><para>Some of the first help to get to Thailand came from the ACT hospital trauma section. Three of our medical trauma specialists were up there very quickly assisting with triage to help assist and move people as quickly as they could in those important first few days following the effect that was felt in southern Thailand. RAAF personnel were among the first Australians sent to Indonesia to help, and Australian Defence Force personnel remain in some of the worst affected areas providing, medical, logistical and other relief services. They will be there for some time. The AFP was also very involved and remains so. While so many Australians were justifiably attempting to return home as quickly as possible, the Australian armed services were preparing to send people just as quickly into Banda Aceh. I understand that some forensics teams that lent their services to the Indonesian government in the wake of the Bali bombing are now conducting DNA tests to identify, as much as possible, the unnamed victims of the tsunami. They are performing a truly unenviable task, and I believe no words expressed here can adequately describe the courage or the quality of character displayed by those people.</para><para>A Canberra resident—in fact, a constituent of mine—Percy Samara-Wickrama is a retired engineer originally from Galle in Sri Lanka. Percy has contributed to aid projects in Bosnia and Kosovo with an aid organisation known as RedR—Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief. Percy returned to Sri Lanka, to Galle, very soon after the disaster to assist in the rebuilding of two villages as part of a project called Operation Hope. One hundred per cent of funds donated to Operation Hope will go towards rebuilding those villages with a view to sustaining their long-term recovery. All administration costs are being met by Percy's family, such is his determination to help the area he was born in. I know from discussions that my officers had with Percy's son that the effort to set up Operation Hope has been enormous, and I commend very strongly the work that Percy and his family have done in that personal way to dedicate themselves to something they truly believe in. </para><para>I know that the ACT community, both through the business and professional community and just folk living out there in the electorate, are all getting behind Operation Hope and doing what they can. They can actually see a direct connection between their efforts to support this particular enterprise and the actual, physical rebuilding of a couple of villages within Percy's family's original area in Sri Lanka. I know that even local WIN TV have been following the progress of this very closely, and I commend that very strongly. This is just one example. There are so many other examples around the country where people are doing similar things.</para><para>If I or anyone else in this place were to try to name every organisation, government department or individual who deserved specific praise, I am sure we would all be here far longer than any of us have time allowed for any one speech on this issue. While the challenge of rebuilding may well be the greatest ever presented by a natural disaster on this planet, companies, charities and ordinary citizens have proved and are proving that we can and will meet this challenge. I again want to make reference to the level of response that we are seeing through all of our communities. Every one of the members and senators within this place could stand up and cite examples from their own communities where there have been wonderful responses. The type that I think epitomises it most for me has been not necessarily from here but just the photos in the papers of children setting up lemonade stalls in streets. At any level that people can, they want to be involved and they need to be involved. We can be very proud, as Australians, of seeing the sort of human response that is coming from our Australian community to this terrible disaster.</para><para>I would like once more to extend my condolences to the nations affected by this disaster. All of those nations have been named in the parliament, and I do not need to go through those again. Suffice it to say that there are far too many, and the tragic outcome is still being measured in many of those countries. I want to record, as well, on behalf of my electorate, my gratitude to our armed forces, our charities and the people of my community and of Australia generally for their collective response to this tragedy.</para><para>In conclusion, whilst the response has been, as I have said, so warm-hearted, the difficulty now, I think, will be to continue that response into the months and the years to come. The dimension of this disaster is such that things are not going to be rebuilt overnight. Continuing connection to these communities around the Indian Ocean rim is going to be needed for some years to come. I think we all are going to need to do what we can to support the ongoing rebuilding and the ongoing call for help in re-establishing lives, communities, buildings, business enterprises and community and social networks. All of those things are going to take time. I have every confidence that the Australian community will be in a position to continue that connection with these people for the years to come, because that is what is going to be required.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>129</page.no><name role="metadata">Fawcett, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FAWCETT</name><name.id>DYU</name.id><electorate>Wakefield</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the motion moved by the Prime Minister and endorse the comments of the previous speakers. Many speakers have rightly lauded the excellent work of the Australian Defence Force medical and engineering teams who have worked tirelessly to bring about real change in the areas devastated by the Boxing Day tsunami. Today, however, I wish to particularly highlight the significant contribution by the men and women of the Australian Army Aviation Corps and the Royal Australian Air Force Air Lift Group. These people deploy and operate with little publicity, but they are often the main source of mobility in areas where the ADF have served Australia, such as the drought relief in Papua New Guinea, operations in Bougainville, the Solomon Islands, Iraq, East Timor and, most recently, Banda Aceh. </para></talk.start><para>Members of 36 and 37 Squadron of the Air Lift Group have flown Hercules aircraft on a continual basis to deliver aid and to evacuate people whose lives have been devastated by the tsunami. Over 1,100 tonnes of aid have been sent from Australia to Sumatra, much of it carried by the aircraft of the Air Lift Group. Elements of the 16th Brigade Army Aviation were some of the first ADF assets deployed to Sumatra. Within days of the tsunami, 47 members of A Squadron, Fifth Aviation Regiment, had returned from leave and been deployed with four Iroquois helicopters to commence operations from Banda Aceh airport.</para><para>Members of 173 Surveillance Squadron had deployed a Super King Air aircraft to operate from Medan. To date, these Army aviators have carried over 100,000 kilograms of food, water and medical supplies as well as carrying out numerous life-saving medical evacuation flights. I should also mention the actions of Major James Brown, the A Squadron Detachment Commander, who was one of the first people on the scene when a U.S. Navy Seahawk helicopter crashed. In his actions rescuing the crew from the wreckage, he sustained injuries which required his repatriation to Australia. I wish him a full and speedy recovery.</para><para>In acknowledging and thanking the members of the Army Aviation Corps and the Air Lift Group, and the maintenance engineers who support them, I wish also to thank their families. The long period of concurrent deployments around the world of ADF aviation assets has put a huge strain on families—often young families—who remain at home. They cope with a number of pressures and uncertainties unique to having a family member deployed on operations, as well as the normal aspects of family life. I wish to take this opportunity to place on record my thanks to them for their sacrifice which allows the ADF to, yet again, play a significant part in contributing to our region and making all Australians proud.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>130</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—First of all, I would like to congratulate the Prime Minister on putting this motion before the chamber. I am sure that every single member of the House would support this motion. Certainly for my own part I can say that I endorse every jot and every particle of this motion, as I also endorsed every action that the Prime Minister and the government took in the wake of the tsunami of 26 December. The action was timely, appropriate and necessary in the face of a disaster that was then not seen to be as great as it now has been revealed to be in the fullness of time. Almost 300,000 people have had their lives destroyed and their communities devastated. The timeliness of the response and its appropriateness is what any government should have delivered—coalition or Labor. So I congratulate the Prime Minister. I also congratulate the parliamentary secretary, the member for Dunkley, Bruce Billson, who carried most of the government's practical response during the immediate aftermath of the tsunami. In doing so, I underline the fact that this is a bipartisan response to an absolutely overwhelming natural disaster.</para></talk.start><para>There are particulars within this motion that I will come back to. I simply want to look in the first instance at point (1) which says:</para><para>That the House: </para><para>(1)	extends to all Australians who suffered personal losses during the tragic 26 December Indian Ocean tsunami disaster its profound sympathy in their bereavement and wishes a speedy recovery to the injured ...</para><para>Luckily, in this disaster the level of loss of life for Australians was comparatively small when you look at the other countries affected. Sweden of course had so many thousands of its people who had their lives simply ripped away from them because they went to one destination in Thailand. Germans suffered too—not in equal measure, but still a large number of people lost their lives. Given Australians' propensity to travel to South-East Asia—and, indeed, to Thailand, one of the affected countries—and to spend their holiday periods there, we were lucky that more were not lost. I have been to Phuket with my wife. I stayed at the Sheraton resort which was devastated by this tsunami. I have stood on the beach. I swam in the water. I have been in the position of those people who, almost in the twinkling of an eye, had their lives completely turned around. It is instructive in a way to step back and think about our situation and the situation of others in current circumstances, and consider how things were different before modern communications were operating in terms of the localised responses to such things.</para><para>A little while I ago stood on a headland at Balmoral Beach, out on a rocky area near the end, just past the children's pool, and I looked out towards the Heads and back to the escarpment at Balmoral. I was thinking about the deep ocean trench between Australia and New Zealand and the fact that the eruption of an earthquake within that trench could cause a tsunami to come onto Australian beaches, and that I could be in the situation that all those hundreds of thousands of people were—here one minute, gone the next. The predictability of this is extremely low unless you have proper and effective monitoring systems, as there are in the Pacific. So at least we have those things in place and have had for a long period.</para><para>It is quite apparent that one of the major problems in the regions affected—in Banda Aceh in Indonesia, in Thailand and less so for those countries that were further away and, indeed, the ones that we did not hear about much at all—was the lack of an early warning. I had contemplated going on a holiday in Mauritius during that period. Mauritius was slightly affected but had plenty of warning because of what was apparent with regard to what happened in Banda Aceh and Thailand. It also hit the Seychelles, another Indian Ocean holiday place primarily used by people from France and other parts of Europe, and it hit the African coast as well. The result and impact there were much less, not because of the intensity of the waves but because of the early warning.</para><para>For all those Australians who lost their lives because there was not an early warning system in place, I join with all of those others from the opposition and from the government side who have said that there should be a priority placed on creating the same type of early warning system in the Indian Ocean as we have had in the Pacific Ocean for many years. We have friends who have relatives living in Thailand. Indeed, they run a business on the beach. It just so happened that on that morning, because they were caught up, they were not down on the beach running the business. They had to get children from school and they were further into the hinterland. By luck, their lives were saved. But, for all of those people who were doing the very normal thing of enjoying their holidays, when something like this emerges and sweeps them away so rapidly it is really hard to comprehend the immensity of it. I really could not get a handle on the strength of the waves or their impact until I looked at the footage. Certain camera angles can show it to you, and it was only a couple of weeks down the track that some of the home footage shot by people who were there gave a better indication of what happened in particular places. </para><para>One of the things that stands out is that the world now is very different to what it was previously. In the past, going back to prehistoric times, there were of course always natural disasters, some of which wiped out hundreds of thousands of people. But when they happened two key things were different from the situation today. The first is that in the hunter-gatherer period people were effectively in small bands. The density of the population worldwide was much less. It was not until the agricultural revolution and the creation of settled communities that we had an increasing density of population and an increasing number of people in the population who could be affected locally in one place. So in prehistoric times there were fewer people to be so affected and, because they existed in scattered bands and moved through the environment in a way that did not have as much impact as settled communities, there was less chance of being caught up in these kinds of disasters. More importantly, no-one knew what happened to individual groups of people because they were isolated from their fellows.</para><para>It is only in the period of modern civilisations, not just civilisations post the agricultural revolution but those with speedy communications, that you can get a handle on what happens in fundamental natural disasters. You only need to go back 100 years or more and the reality was that people did not hear about major natural disasters, whether it was the eruption of Vesuvius or Mount Etna or the great disaster caused by Krakatoa, until either the physical evidence was present before them—and that took some time, for instance, in regard to Krakatoa—or the associated tsunamis had happened as a result of those earthquake events in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific. There was a great deal of lag time before people found out about them. As for trying to get help and support, there was not the modern response that there has been to this tsunami.</para><para>Because of modern communications, we know about, can feel about and have empathy for those people who lost their lives or had their places destroyed. As the previous speaker indicated, with their modern transport systems, the Australian defence forces were able to take aid and assistance—medical aid, food and water—to people desperately in need of it. What the government did, supported by the opposition in a nonpartisan way, in moving as swiftly as possible to go to the aid of those people most in need of our help, was a tremendous achievement. It was an achievement that goes to the core of an Australian response—the fact that people wholeheartedly and rapidly went to the assistance of others and did so in a period when normally the country would be on holiday.</para><para>Associated with that was a very clear understanding, not only of the logistical problems that there would be in Banda Aceh, for instance, but also of the fact that targeted assistance was necessary in those places most seriously affected by the tsunami because they were the most proximate. The province of Banda Aceh suffered directly because it was closest to the undersea earthquake and had less warning time than anywhere else. Given the nature of the topography, it had a very wide area that was completely devastated, to the point where there is virtually nothing left standing. I think it is right and appropriate that Australian aid has been primarily focused there.</para><para>We also know that there has been a substantial effort in Sri Lanka, and there has been some effort as well in relation to Thailand. In fact, the Thai government have indicated that the thing we could do to help the most would be to encourage people to go on holiday to those areas again—to take up the normal response that one would see. The Thai government have the ability to rebuild their infrastructure and to handle their own demands and needs in this area themselves. But they want people to come back. They want to re-establish a sense of the necessity to support these tourist destinations by people travelling to them. </para><para>That will not happen easily unless there is a sense of sureness on the part of those people who would travel there—that is, a sense that the places are rebuilt, that they are safer in terms of the general safety of water, food and so on and that they have readily available services. For an event like this, coming with no signal, no clarion call and no time for people to respond, an early warning system must be built. In that way, people can be sure, if they are going to those places to relax and rebuild themselves in a holiday mode, that they will not have the idea that this could happen to them. The lives of all those hundreds of thousands of innocent people who were killed in this disaster should not have been lost only for this to happen again in the same way. It is absolutely critical to all of those people—not only in holiday areas but in areas like Banda Aceh, with people leading very normal lives, going about their activities—that they are able to rebuild in the hills or more mountainous areas or, indeed, on the plain again. But it is also critical that they have some protection through the use of available technologies as well as the use of our intelligence and abilities to predict these incidents and their effects better than we can.</para><para>Part of the human aspect of this is that although the early warning system for the underground earthquake registered in Australia, the results were misinterpreted. First, they thought that it was not as great as it was. Second, they did not think there would be a tsunami effect because, when you look at the gradings for seismic activity, there is an exponential factor with respect to their gravity. For example, a size seven is entirely different from a size 7½ or a size eight—or in this case, one going on for a size nine. It is always probable in human affairs that, even with the best attention to such things, people will get them wrong. This experience has been so grave and so disastrous for the entire region and those communities involved that it is imperative that we get it right.</para><para>It is also imperative that we continue to do as we have done, and that is to build and strengthen the relationship between Australia and Indonesia so that Indonesians of goodwill will understand, as they have in the past, that the present involvement of Australia and its future involvement will be to build with them to allow them to renovate, reinvigorate and rejuvenate their people and their circumstances, particularly in Banda Aceh, so that as good neighbours and good citizens of the world we can renew what was destroyed and open up for the survivors a life that is open, free and not dominated by the fear of this happening again.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>133</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In considering and remembering the tragedy of Boxing Day, the tsunami and the human loss, I recall the words of John Donne from 400 years ago. John Donne was an English cleric, author and poet. He wrote:</para></talk.start><quote><para>No man is an island, entire of himself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were ... any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. </para></quote><para>Those words, 400 years old, are as relevant today—and sadly perhaps more relevant than they were then—as one could imagine. On Boxing Day we saw that, and we saw a response which echoed the words as well, which was perhaps the bright light in an otherwise tragic episode in human history. In speaking to this motion of condolence to the tsunami victims I want to refer to three things: I want to talk briefly about the tragedy, and then about the Australian response and finally, in my role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, I want to refer to the steps forward, as I have carriage in my area of the Bureau of Meteorology, which has a significant role in warning people about the possible arrival and consequences of natural disasters.</para><para>The tragedy, as we are all aware, has probably taken 300,000 lives, and that figure may continue to grow. That figure of 300,000 was most profoundly registered in the province of Banda Aceh in Indonesia, which suffered an almost instantaneous double of earthquake and tsunami. Nothing could have been done then or now, and probably not within the next 500 years, to warn people of that kind of arrival. The process from earthquake to tsunami was almost instantaneous—within a period of 20 minutes. However, there is always a response. As we radiate out from the epicentre through the Indian Ocean region we see that there was a time lapse. We will be able to deal with and improve our warning systems on that front. However, the tragedy that affected Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka in large part, India and to a lesser extent Burma, the Maldives and even as far away as the Seychelles and the African coast, reminds us of who we are and what we have lost. It brings us together in a way that was not sought, but which is in some way uplifting.</para><para>This brings me to the second point, which is about the response. It has shown us the capacity we have as individuals, as countries, as citizens and as communities to respond in times of crisis. Sure, there was an Australian government response—which was right, appropriate, just and generous—but that is not the real focus. The real focus is what occurred in every one of our electorates. In every electorate around Australia, in every community, there was an outpouring of generosity and grief for those whom we may have not known and will never know. There was an emotional response and a practical response.</para><para>I want to acknowledge some of the practical responses within my own electorate of Flinders. Firstly, the Phillip Island <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> staff, led by the editor, Anne Oswin, worked with a series of community groups such as Rotary to create a table, which they then covered with $2 coins in the main street. That table was filled multiple times. Over the course of January it generated approximately $50,000 and led to that small community contributing a total of $100,000 to the international Red Cross. It was one little community, one small island and one simple activity. I commend Anne Oswin and the staff of the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline>, the volunteers from Rotary and all the other volunteer groups on the island. That is one example of local generosity that was replicated throughout Australia. That generosity was replicated through corporate giving and at the national level.</para><para>Whilst the government has given resources, what I think is extraordinary at the national level is the role that Australia's defence personnel have played. They have given their time, they have been drawn away from their families and they have been on the front line. The defence and medical personnel, whether it is in Banda Aceh or in other parts of the region, have played an extraordinary role. I thank them, I commend them and I acknowledge their work. </para><para>I also want to look at the steps forward. The outpouring of compassion and the response has been quick, clear and practical, and it has been uniform across the country. But the real question at this moment in history, at the beginning of the 21st century, is: what are our options for trying to avoid these sorts of disasters happening again? In Banda Aceh, nothing could be done to deal with an immediate crisis and natural disaster of this magnitude. When there is an earthquake and immediate tsunami, there will be a human tragedy. Let us not pretend that we can avoid that at this stage in our history. We simply do not have the capacity to predict an earthquake accurately to the day or the hour. We talk in decades and centuries in terms of probability.</para><para>But there are perhaps three critical steps that we can take moving forwards, which deal not just with tsunami warning systems but with the whole notion of disaster warning systems. They proceed along three fronts. The first element in any early warning system is monitoring. This is perhaps the easiest part to get right. There is a Pacific tsunami warning system based in Hawaii, but there has been no such similar thing within the Indian Ocean region. The reasons are: firstly, history and the lack of apparent need—human history is seen in the present century over decades, not over eons; and secondly, because it is a developing region and it has not been seen as a priority. We now know, with the benefit of hindsight, that it must be a priority—that we have to view our responsibilities to future generations in terms of centuries and eons, not just in terms of immediate needs. The once in a century or once in 500 year natural disaster could be now or it could be at any other time within that frame.</para><para>It is possible to provide the technological warning. That exists within the Pacific system. Australia is playing a role in coordinating through the International Oceanographic Commission that set of skills and is working towards the capabilities and the technological options within the Indian Ocean region. A system will be set up. We have already been involved through meetings in Kobe on the World Conference on Disaster Reduction and in Phuket. We will be involved in other meetings in establishing that Indian Ocean regional tsunami warning system but also more broadly in the entire disaster system.</para><para>The second element of any warning system, other than the technological capability, is education—that is, what to do in the event of an active, live warning. We have within Australia two very good models of that—bushfire and cyclone events. They need to be advanced, but in terms of public education these models can be exported and replicated throughout the Indian Ocean region. We have already committed to do that. There is a lot more to do, but we will be doing that sort of public education. We will be working within each individual country to try to encourage the development of such systems.</para><para>The third and most difficult part of any warning system is about what you might call the last mile—how you get the technology or the ability to communicate with people in rural villages in a short time frame over the last mile. We do have, through mobile technology—and I am glad that the member for Wentworth is here; he is one of the pioneers within Australia and one of the most knowledgeable people in this field—the capacity to push messages out to every mobile device and every fixed line device over the last mile through automated systems. Only this morning, I was exploring with a number of people how we can do that throughout the Indian Ocean region and also within Australia. That is something which we have not embraced yet and which we must embrace. It is the next generation of wholesale warning. But these are rural villages. These are developing parts of the world, so we also need to work on general broadcast facilities within these villages. Again, that was something we were looking at this morning. </para><para>There is a lot more to be done. These systems will not be perfect because, if we face a genuine, immediate natural disaster, there is no warning and no capacity to avoid that which is immediate. But where there is any sort of delay between event and consequence, the capacity to provide warning is something which we can do. We see now that the Indian Ocean region is vulnerable, that this was not something of the fantastic and the imaginary but potential and real. Krakatoa is not something of history; unfortunately, it is something of our present. So that is the future, that is what we have to work towards and that is what we are working towards.</para><para>Ultimately, I want to return to where I began: the notion that no man is an island and each man's death diminishes me because I am of mankind. That sentiment is with us. It is something which we forget and something which unfortunately it too often takes a tragedy to resurrect within our thinking and our being. The lesson of the last month is that, as a society, we have within us an extraordinary capacity. If we can in any way on all sides of this chamber do whatever we can to work together to try to encourage that sentiment and to encourage that sense of national unity and common humanity, then we will be doing something of real meaning for future generations. I thank all of those people, most simply signified by the people of Phillip Island, members of the Phillip Island <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> and Phillip Island Rotary for their generosity, because they tell us what we can be and they tell us what we should be.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>136</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I rise to speak on this motion in my capacity as shadow minister for health and member for Lalor, but perhaps most importantly as a human being. You would not be a human being unless you felt a strong emotional reaction to the dreadful tragedy that unfolded on our TV screens and on the pages of our newspapers from Boxing Day on. We can all probably identify different moments of that coverage which emotionally affected us. I certainly remember the Australian woman who came back to Australia with her two children but described a moment of indescribable horror when she needed to work out which child she would hold on to and which child she would let go—an almost unimaginable thing for a mother to do that we know in popular culture as <inline font-style="italic">Sophie's Choice</inline>. Fortunately for her, both of her children survived but in devastation where so many did not.</para></talk.start><para>We know that the devastation affected our region broadly: Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Burma, the Maldives, East Africa, Kenya, the Seychelles, Somalia, Madagascar, and Tanzania. The tsunami hit across our region and caused an almost unimaginable loss of life—about 290,000 people, with possibly more deaths to be recorded, and 240,000 people in Indonesia alone.</para><para>I am sure we are all aware now that the unofficial Australian death toll is 24, with relatives having confirmed six deaths on top of the 18 deaths officially listed by DFAT. We know that grave concerns remain for 10 Australians who were in tsunami affected areas and whose bodies have not been identified or are still subject to formal victim identification processes. As has been remarked by many speakers in this debate, the outpouring of generosity from Australians confronted with this tragedy was huge—huge at both the community and the official level. That is something for which Australia can be proud. All of us have stories of seeing people put in amounts of money that were probably almost beyond their capacity to donate at one time to one cause. But so moved were they that Australians were hugely generous in response to this tragedy. The Australian government, with the full support of the opposition, of course, announced a $1 billion program, the Australia-Indonesia partnership for reconstruction and redevelopment. It is a five-year commitment and the single largest aid package in Australia's history. We should be rightly proud of that as a country. </para><para>I would particularly like to direct my remarks to the work that was done in the health and medical area as an immediate response to the tsunami. Obviously, with a disaster like this there is not only dealing with the immediate loss of life but also dealing with people who are injured and the loss of critical infrastructure—such as that providing fresh water—and the consequences that has for the prospects of major disease outbreaks. Of course, one of the greatest risks facing the survivors of the tsunami was disease arising from the water or airborne diseases. The lack of fresh water and sanitation meant that outbreaks of communicable diseases such as cholera and typhoid were, rightly, very greatly feared as the next big killer after the devastation of the tsunami itself.</para><para>As recently as 4 February this year, the World Health Organisation has reported that there have been no outbreaks of disease in tsunami affected areas. That can be seen to be due to the unprecedented level of assistance from the world and from Australia to prevent that kind of catastrophe happening. Incidents of tetanus, measles and malaria have occurred but these appear to be controlled; the ability to react quickly has been crucial in ensuring their control. Australia has provided aid in the health and medical area to reduce risk. Particularly, we provided a water purification plant, capable of producing up to 480,000 litres of water a day, for distribution to the devastated communities in Banda Aceh. We also sourced and delivered 129,000 20-litre water containers to Banda Aceh to keep the supply of fresh water flowing.</para><para>There has been funding provided for a water and sanitation specialist to undertake an assessment and provide support for the provincial administration in addressing the immediate water supply and sanitation needs in Aceh. The World Health Organisation has formulated a mental health response for the people of Banda Aceh. Given the level of devastation in this region, the World Health Organisation is assessing mental health needs, training community leaders and ensuring the Aceh psychiatric hospital is equipped to deal with the longer-term effects of a disaster on this scale. Australia directly provided a 90-bed Australian Defence Force field hospital in Banda Aceh; funding for a team of 24 Australian doctors to provide urgent medical assistance; funding for a health assessment team, including specialists in health sector coordination, psychosocial support, child protection and infectious disease; and pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to Banda Aceh.</para><para>We have provided tetanus immunisation to treat and prevent the disease at the request of the World Health Organisation. We have provided medical supplies for the general hospital in Medan for the treatment of tsunami victims airlifted from Banda Aceh. We have provided support for re-establishing a procurement and medical supply distribution network in Banda Aceh and provided vital infrastructure and human resources for that purpose. We have supported the restoration of government mental health services by engaging a psychosocial trauma support specialist to undertake an assessment of the mental hospital and mental health needs more broadly in Banda Aceh. We have provided support for the restoration of government maternal health services by engaging a maternal health specialist, Kerry Ross, to conduct a rapid assessment of maternal health needs, focusing on midwife capacity, in the Aceh province. We have provided support for government engagement in infectious disease surveillance and control, and we have provided support for an infectious disease specialist from the Mentor, a malaria prevention non-government organisation which is now working on the issue of the malaria risk. </para><para>All of these things have been provided by Australia with Australian aid efforts. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate all of those who have been involved in providing these services. Efforts of such enormous dimension require not only people on the ground providing the services but coordination. Huge amounts of work and rapid responses are needed. Hundreds of people, possibly thousands, have been involved in these individual health and medical efforts that I have reported to the House today. Each of those individuals deserves our great congratulation.</para><para>Whilst we are very proud of the rapid response, we know that there are ongoing issues that we need to deal with as a result of the tsunami. Some of those are in the health and medical area. As we move from the wave of the tsunami and the devastation it left to the time beyond, one of the deepest concerns is the mental health needs of those who have survived. When people have had their lives destroyed, when they have lost loved ones, when they have perhaps lost all of their family, there is obviously a need for ongoing mental health assistance and support.</para><para>The second ongoing challenge for us is to ensure that we look after children's health and wellbeing. In the Banda Aceh camps, where about four million people live, about three per cent, or 120,000, are children younger than five. UNICEF has warned that 12.7 per cent of children surveyed at camps in and around the provincial capital of Banda Aceh suffer malnutrition, which stunts growth, retards mental development and weakens the immune system. UNICEF has warned that conditions could be even worse outside the provincial capital and calls the situation a `critical emergency' requiring immediate intervention. So, as we have responded to the immediate challenge, now the task is to respond to some of these longer term challenges in the areas of children's health and mental health and the physical rebuilding that is required across the region.</para><para>Other members have referred to particular contributions that people in their electorates have made to the aid effort. I would like to take the opportunity to do the same. In my local community there was an immediate response to the fundraising effort, as I am sure there was across Australia. The Hudson family of Werribee were holidaying in Phuket at the time of the tsunami. Luckily they all survived. The Hudson family are good mates of mine—notwithstanding the fact that I run into them every election day handing out Liberal how-to-vote cards—but I do not take it personally. They are good friends, and it was good to see them all return to Australia safe and well.</para><para>The Morris and Freeman families of Werribee, who were holidaying in Phuket, stayed to help with the clean-up. My electorate is home to many members of the Sri Lankan community in Melbourne and obviously they were particularly affected and particularly concerned about the fate of their family members. A Melton resident, Rozanne Short, who is a Sri Lankan community member, helped with fundraising efforts locally, particularly within the Sri Lankan community.</para><para>The Point Cook Residents Association have been involved in a pattern of providing ongoing assistance. They are going to have a fun run in March, a trivia night in June, a bike-a-thon in October and a Christmas twilight function in December. So they have dedicated their functions across the whole year to fundraising for the tsunami. Local Wyndham residents Justine Colley and Jacquie Cook have coordinated fundraising efforts in the Werribee area. The Hoppers Crossing Cricket Club had a special match against the Sri Lankan community on Australia Day. St Andrews Primary School sold pancakes on Pancake Tuesday, and the proceeds of that are going to tsunami victims. So the efforts across my community continue, and I am sure that they are going to continue across this year and hopefully beyond, because that is what is going to be required to ensure that we help rebuild our neighbours from this disaster. </para><para>Whilst I am on my feet can I take the opportunity to also pass on my condolences to those who were affected by the South Australian bushfires. As members of this House might know, whilst I am a proud Victorian now, representing a Victorian seat, I grew up in South Australia. My parents and sister lived—it was not our family home—for a lot of their lives in the hills area. When you have got family members who live in those parts of Adelaide you always worry about bushfires. I was particularly concerned about family members when we faced the horror of Ash Wednesday all those years ago. Knowing what it is like to live with that kind of apprehension, I did feel a particular emotional call when we saw the devastation that flowed from the bushfires on the Eyre Peninsula, killing nine people and causing about $50 million worth of damage. So I take the opportunity to record my condolences to the surviving family members of people who lost their lives, and also to those who have been affected economically and in other ways by what was a very big bushfire disaster, even by Australian standards—and we are a nation that knows about big bushfire disasters almost more than any other nation on earth.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>139</page.no><name role="metadata">Turnbull, Malcolm, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TURNBULL</name><name.id>885</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On 16 January after the terrible disaster of Boxing Day, there was a ceremony at North Bondi Surf Club at Bondi Beach. It was held in the ocean. A group of board-riders paddled out, formed a circle and cast a wreath into the ocean. It was a very poignant ceremony because of course nobody better understands than lifesavers the way in which the ocean not only entices us as a place to play and to sport ourselves in the sun but also is a very dangerous place. I think that might be why Australians have been so generous and have been filled with so much empathy and compassion for the victims of this disaster. Most of us live on the coast, most of us are very familiar with the sea and most of us recognise that as not only a place for enjoyment and a place for sport but also an element that can turn on you very quickly, be it a wave, a storm, a tide or, in this case, for the people of the Indian Ocean's rim, a gigantic tidal wave.</para></talk.start><para>I think we all recognise that these disasters can happen anywhere in the world. `There but for the grace of God go I' is a very important point. In Sydney Harbour there are giant sandstone boulders which were, geologists believe, thrown up over the cliffs, over the foreshore, into Sydney Harbour by giant waves. There is no reason to believe that the next tidal wave could not be hitting our shores or any part of it. It is hard to know—I am not a geologist, let alone a seismologist—but one has to ask why the big shift, the earthquake, that occurred off the coast of Tasmania did not itself create a tidal wave. Perhaps the next one will. Our hearts go out as humans. As the member for Flinders just said, we share a common humanity with all of the victims of this earthquake, as we do with the victims of all disasters. It is that humanity that ties us together all around the world, regardless of where we live. But we also share a special bond because of our understanding of the sea and our recognition of what the sea can do. </para><para>My wife and I had a very immediate connection with the disaster. A friend of ours who is a constituent of mine, a young woman called Cassie McGann, was staying in a place called Hikkaduwa in Sri Lanka. She rang my wife and left a message on Lucy's mobile phone. Her message went: `I'm sitting on a rooftop in Hikkaduwa. There's been an enormous wave and the waters are rising. Hundreds of people are dying. I don't know what's happened. I borrowed this phone from a French woman, but I think the battery is running out.' Then, indeed, it did run out and we heard no more from her. In the disaster we immediately thought, `How can we find her?' I have to say that the diplomats at the Australian High Commission in Colombo were outstanding. They were not just looking for her, of course; they were looking for all the Australians. But they immediately had teams of their staff going up and down that coast with vehicles, calling out, `Any Aussies? Any Brits? Anyone who speaks English? Are there any foreigners?' They were gathering them all together. Mercifully and miraculously, Cassie was found. She had managed to get to high ground, as, indeed, most Australians did.</para><para>It is genuinely a miracle that only a relatively small number of Australians have been killed. We miss every one of them; every one of them is a terrible loss. But, compared with the losses of other countries, including countries whose people in that region were mostly tourists, as ours were, our loss was very small. That underlines the great compassion and generosity of the Australian people. Of all the Western countries, we were probably the least affected in terms of people actually killed, and I suspect that is a function of the time of year. Most Australians who want to go to the beach on Boxing Day have a beach in Australia to go to rather than having to go to Thailand. That is not so if you are a Swede, a Norwegian or a German escaping from the frozen north. Notwithstanding that relatively small loss, tragic though it was, our contribution was greater per capita than any other country. I believe that great compassion and that generosity is because of the empathy we felt as a people who live mostly by the sea and are close to the sea and who do not turn our backs to the sea. As coast-living people we had a great and immediate empathy with that disaster, recognising its nature and recognising how it could have come to affect us.</para><para>The leadership shown by the Prime Minister and all his ministers has been outstanding, and I think it is wonderful to see such bipartisan endorsement for the government's leadership in the midst of this crisis. The Prime Minister's leadership was pre-eminent. He is the Prime Minister; it was his initiative to make this appropriately enormous pledge of aid to Indonesia, our nearest neighbour and the country that was worst hit. It is important to bear in mind, as the member for Flinders said, that no matter how good your warning system might have been no warning could have saved the people of Aceh. The earthquake was on their doorstep. Better warning systems are needed and will be put in place, and they certainly could have helped the people in Thailand, India, Sri Lanka and further afield. But if the earthquake is on your doorstep there will never be enough time.</para><para>The aid that has been given and the help that has been given by our defence forces and our public servants has been outstanding. I would also like to pay tribute to the outstanding work done by Alexander Downer, our foreign minister. Bruce Billson, the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs, is, in many respects, an unsung hero. He was everywhere around the region organising aid. I had many discussions with him because many of my constituents who had relevant experience wanted to assist with support. </para><para>One organisation in which I am involved—of which I am a director, in fact—is Clean Up Australia, headed by Ian Kiernan. It is the largest grassroots environmental organisation in Australia and famous for organising Clean Up Australia Day, which we are all familiar with. Clean Up Australia, which has a very important commitment to water purification and water recycling, immediately put in place measures which enabled it to deliver a great many small water purification devices—you could call them `plants' but they are really more like devices—to the damaged areas so that people in villages could quickly get clean drinking water again. Obviously, large water purification plants are only suitable in large centres where there is a considerable population, and in Indonesia, in particular, the population is very dispersed.</para><para>In my electorate, as in every electorate—I think every member and every senator in this parliament would have had the same experience—constituents were immediately generous. People were generous in accordance with their means, and some people gave beyond their means. In my own electorate there were extraordinary events. There was one dinner that my friends Michael and Judy McMahon organised at Catalina, a restaurant in Rose Bay, which raised $277,000 in one night—an extraordinary amount of generosity. There were similar events at other restaurants and clubs, and there were walks, bikeathons and so forth. There has been a massive outpouring of compassion across Australia and of course across my own electorate.</para><para>The question, I suppose, when we talk about compassion and the generosity of our community is: how can we ensure that this continues? A lot of people are asking the question: is this just a one-off event? I visited the international charity Caritas, which is the Catholic Church's international relief agency, the other day and met with its director, Jack de Groote. They have obviously been overwhelmed by the generosity. But there are of course many other disasters in other parts of the world which have not been as spectacular but where the need is just as great. Has this event opened up the compassion in our hearts not just for this occasion but to make us a more generous, more compassionate and more humane nation? I hope it has. I believe it has. But I think it will be up to all of us to ensure that that spirit of philanthropy, that spirit of giving, continues across the community.</para><para>We should of course remember the victims of the South Australian bushfire disaster, who were very much closer to home. Natural disasters occur in many shapes, in many forms and in many different places. None of us are exempt. The victims of that disaster suffered just as the victims of the earthquake in the Indian Ocean did, and they have rightly deserved our compassion, support and sympathy as well.</para><para>In terms of the future protection against earthquakes, we cannot proof ourselves against earthquakes. The power of the earth not only exceeds the ability of man to resist it but exceeds the ability of man to comprehend it. One of the important lessons from all of this, I believe, is the need to focus on the ability to respond to disasters quickly. Were it not for the Australian and United States armed forces, the people of Aceh would not have received the aid they received in as timely a fashion as they did. The massive infrastructure that is required to deliver aid to these areas at this stage in this region is largely in the hands of the United States. After the United States, our ability to do that would be second. It is a very important role for the defence forces. It is extraordinary, really, to see that the United States—whose image in parts of Indonesia and the region has perhaps not always been as high as it would like it to have been—because of that massive military presence, was singularly able to give the relief that it did to the people in that region. </para><para>We need to think more about the ability to deliver aid. I remember speaking with diplomats in Colombo, on the telephone obviously, after the earthquake. They made the point—and this was even more the case in Indonesia—that there simply was no infrastructure left. The roads had been destroyed. It was extremely hard to get aid into places which had been so damaged other than by ship or by air. By definition, your conventional infrastructure has been destroyed, so you need something else.</para><para>In summary, this has been a disaster almost beyond comprehension. However, it has brought out in the people of Australia not just great sympathy and great compassion but great deeds by many Australians in the defence forces and the public service and by our diplomats and our medical teams. Right down to the day-to-day level of ordinary Australians, people have felt the pain of our neighbours in the Indian Ocean, and they have done their best, be it with big cheques from corporations or wealthy individuals down to coins in buckets in shopping centres and in churches. In doing that, we have shown what we have always known but too often forget: that everybody around the world, all of us, are each other's brothers and sisters, and when any of us are hurt or when any of us are subject to a disaster then we all suffer. We relieve that suffering by showing our compassion and our generosity in the way we have done.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>142</page.no><name role="metadata">Livermore, Kirsten, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LIVERMORE</name><name.id>83A</name.id><electorate>Capricornia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I felt very strongly that I needed to speak on this motion.

Hopefully this is going to shape our world into the future as we meet the challenges that this disaster has presented to us.</para></talk.start><para>I got a sense of how the community was feeling when I attended a service at St Joseph's Cathedral, which is just a couple of blocks away from my house. Rockhampton's Churches Together group organised the remembrance service and put the call out to the community to come together to share our shock, our grief and our sense of solidarity and unity as human beings as we were confronted with the terrible images that were coming through the media, and the stories that people in our local community were connected to more directly from the disaster zone.</para><para>We met together at St Joseph's Cathedral, and one of the touches that was suggested—I believe it was by Bishop Brian Heenan from the Catholic Church—was for each person to bring a small tribute; not a wreath or a fancy bouquet that we can just ring up and order from the florist, but for each person or family to bring along a small tribute from their garden, something that meant something to them personally. It was quite moving to watch people from all walks of life from Central Queensland filing down the centre aisle of the cathedral and placing those floral tributes on the altar of the cathedral. Rockhampton is a very tropical place and of course there were hibiscus and frangipani and all the tropical flowers that are bursting out all over Queensland at the moment. More than anything else, that really spelled out to me the connection between the people of Central Queensland and the people in Thailand, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. We linked ourselves to that region through the image of those tropical flowers, because, of course, that is the environment our neighbours in the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia share with us as people of the tropics. That really brought home to me how my community was feeling and the importance of using this opportunity to express, on their behalf, their sympathy and feelings of solidarity with our neighbours who are trying to rebuild their lives after this terrible disaster. </para><para>Having said that I felt strongly that I should participate in this debate, I actually found it incredibly difficult to prepare for it because going through the news clippings and the speeches that have been made about this just brought it all back. It made me look again at the pictures of those orphaned children and the people who had lost everything. I also saw the joy that people with nothing material left in their lives felt when they found a loved one who they thought was missing. It really made me forget about being a member of parliament and respond to it as a human being. So, in trying to prepare for this, I really got lost in the enormity of it all—not just the scale of loss and the scale of the disaster but also the scale of the rebuilding effort that is going to be required by the international community as we help our neighbours in the Indian Ocean nations rebuild their countries, lives and communities.</para><para>It is one thing for me to relive it by flipping through some news clippings; it is another thing for the people who are actually living through this day by day—the people who have lost their homes, families and everything they know. This was really brought home to me when I attended the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum in Vietnam in the middle of January. Sitting around the table were representatives from Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia who were directly affected by this happening to their countries. The Indonesian delegation made a presentation on the first morning of the meeting. They had a video presentation that was the most graphic thing that I have seen in all the news coverage. This was an absolute fly-on-the-wall documentary, taken in what appeared to me to be real time, of people just sitting outside in Banda Aceh having breakfast in front of cafes, stopping to chat to neighbours—it was normal life happening in front of your eyes—and then all of a sudden there was water flowing down the streets. In the footage that I saw, it was quite innocuous—there was just this water coming. But then it kept coming, and all of a sudden it was not water anymore—it was a solid wall of debris sweeping everything in front of it. This idyllic scene of families talking, planning their mornings and eating their breakfast was swept away, both in reality in that location and metaphorically as that happened across a quarter of our world. It was so graphic and profound. The scale of the disaster was demonstrated to me by breaking it down to that very personal snapshot of what was happening in these people's lives as their whole world was swept away.</para><para>The point of all that is that, while it is hard for us to relive what happened, we have to keep reliving it, remembering it and understanding what is required to help these people get back on their feet. It was a situation where you could not change the channel; we were watching the video as part of the Indonesian presentation. As hard as it was and as horrific as it was, you could not change the channel. That is what we have to remember—the people in Thailand, Indonesia and Sri Lanka cannot change the channel. It is their life, and if it is their life then it is our life too.</para><para>The scale of the disaster was enormous but so was the scale of the response from Australia. I am incredibly proud of the $1 billion that the Australian government has provided and the leadership in the aid effort that we have shown as a country. There has also been a quarter of a billion dollars donated by ordinary people and corporations from around Australia. I pay tribute to the people in my electorate for the wonderful response they made. I do not think I have been to a community function since this happened where there has not been a raffle, tickets for a dinner or a street stall raising money and awareness of what is happening in these places, what is required to assist, and the importance of ongoing assistance to ensure that we do not forget what is needed to help these people. </para><para>I would also like to pay tribute to those people in my electorate who have gone to work as volunteers—the doctors, engineers and other aid workers who have gone over to these places to be confronted with incredible hardship and to work in a terribly testing environment. They are basically putting their comfortable lives, in many cases, on hold to help those most in need in our international community.</para><para>Although many members have said this, it is worth noting again: the open-heartedness and generosity demonstrated by the Australian people offer a new dawn in our relationship with Indonesia and our other neighbours. As I said, I was at the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum in Vietnam not long after the tsunami happened, and the sense of unity, the sense that we needed each other as a region and that we had an obligation to each other, was incredibly strong. It was great to be part of the goodwill between all the countries. There was a coming together as human beings and as representatives of our various countries to say, `We want to know what you need and we want to be there to help in the long term.' That is going to set the platform for such a strong relationship going forward not only with Indonesia but with our other near neighbours.</para><para>We need to take forward the lessons that come out of this. We have heard much technical detail about the need for an early warning system and the importance of Australia getting on board with that not only for our own safety and security into the future but also to assist the countries that stand to lose the most if a similar event happens in the future. We need to offer our expertise and financial assistance for those early warning systems.</para><para>We also need to respect the power of nature. We need to understand our world and the environmental challenges we face. We need to work in partnership with other countries to ensure that we do not put our heads in the sand, that we use this demonstration of how powerful and unstoppable these natural forces can be, and that we respect nature, the environment and the planet we live on. We must make sure we do everything we can to live within our natural boundaries as residents of this planet. That includes things like the Kyoto protocol and understanding the challenges facing the small island-states in our Pacific region and in other parts of the world. When we focus on what has happened in the current disaster, we must also understand the environmental disasters that might occur in the years ahead which could affect the people living on the Pacific islands and in other small island-states around the world. We must help them—and certainly not make things worse for them—and understand that we all have to shoulder our responsibility to other nations and other people around the world.</para><para>In my remarks to the APPF, I obviously expressed my condolences and also that sense of solidarity and desire to do everything we can. But I think the most important thing for us as we conclude this debate is to keep remembering, to make sure that we do not change the channel when it gets a bit confronting or go on to the next thing that comes along—to make sure that we are there for the long haul with our neighbours. As I said to the APPF meeting, right now we have this great sense that we have done our bit, but we have to make sure that next year, the year after and the year after that we can look our neighbours in the eye and know that we have continued to do everything we can to help them as they rebuild their lives. Australia has the capacity to do it—we have already shown that in the last month—but we need to make sure that we continue to do it and continue to build those bridges, both real and metaphorical, with our neighbours. Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the debate on this motion. The bipartisan spirit that has been demonstrated in this debate has been very instructive and shows how we can work together when it really counts. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>145</page.no><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr SOUTHCOTT</name><name.id>TK6</name.id><electorate>Boothby</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to associate myself with this motion, support it and support the remarks of the speakers who have preceded me. Boxing Day in Australia is normally a day we associate with family, recovering after perhaps overindulging on Christmas Day, having a holiday if we are not involved in essential services, the start of the Sydney Hobart Yacht Race or the start of the Melbourne cricket test. There are always positive associations with Boxing Day. But now, for our lifetimes, we will always remember it as the day that the tsunami struck a number of countries right around the Indian Ocean.</para></talk.start><para>It is estimated that almost 300,000 people have lost their lives. In Aceh and in Sri Lanka there are people who have lost 50 or 60 members of their extended families. There are couples who were separated—including, of course, many Australians, and we know about them. There are children who were lost. I remember one story of a woman who was holding two children and let go of the older child. Luckily that child was saved—but just to hear that as a parent and think about ever having to make that sort of choice!</para><para>The tsunami was the result of an earthquake just off the west coast of Aceh. It appears that there is increased activity of the plates just off that coast. There have been a number of tremors in that area in the last four or five years. So, while tsunamis are uncommon in recent history in the Indian Ocean region, we do have these plates, where one has slipped underneath the other one, and it seems that tremors are now fairly common. In recent times, the biggest tsunami in that area was of course the tsunami from the explosion of Krakatoa in the 1880s. I think that led to the deaths of about 30,000 people in Indonesia, but this one has been on a different scale.</para><para>Many of these deaths were preventable. The travel times between the epicentre of the earthquake and Sri Lanka and Chennai and so on were quite long. We are not talking minutes; we are talking hours. Many of these deaths were preventable. It is hoped that, just as the Pacific Ocean has a very well-monitored and well-organised tsunami warning system, the Indian Ocean will be able to have something too.</para><para>Just as we found after the bombings in Bali, the tsunami struck many areas that Australians are familiar with. Many Australian holidaymakers would be familiar with the west coast of Thailand, especially Phuket island, with Sri Lanka, with the Maldives and with the Seychelles. We have overseas students studying in Australia and past students who have returned to their countries from Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Thailand and Indonesia, including Aceh. A whole group of Acehnese students are studying in my own state at the University of South Australia.</para><para>For cricketers there were stadiums where they play test cricket, such as the stadium at Chennai, formerly Madras; and the stadium at Galle, where Shane Warne broke the record for the number of wickets taken in test cricket. There are many Australians with dual citizenship who have emigrated from these countries and who have families there. This was the largest natural disaster in the last 100 years and it affected an unprecedented number of countries. It affected their coastlines and so on, but it also affected an unprecedented number of nations and nationalities because of the Europeans who were holidaying in Sri Lanka and Thailand. These were tourist destinations, so it affected the whole world. </para><para>We saw unexpected heroes—the young Australians in Sri Lanka and Thailand, who had some training as nurses, doctors or whatever, who interrupted their holidays to go and do what they could, without many supplies and so on, to help their fellow human beings. There was a young British girl in India, who was about 10 years old, who had learnt in her class that when the water recedes it means there is going to be a Tsunami. She warned people on her beach when she saw this happening and was able to save the lives of hundreds.</para><para>The response to the tsunami I think showed Australia at its best. I was very proud of the response from the Australian government. I was very proud of the response from the Australian public. I was very proud of the response from those who were there who did what they could. Our military personnel are trained to adapt and they are up there now providing food, fresh water, medical supplies and a 90-bed hospital. The HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline> is there with 250 sailors and 150 engineers. In times of tragedy we do find heroes. Peter Cosgrove became known to us through East Timor. The Australian of the Year became known to us as a burns surgeon in Bali. We now have people like Colonel Georgina Whelan, a military surgeon.</para><para>We have sent five civilian medical teams. Many of those on the civilian medical teams from South Australia I know well—I worked and trained with them. Many of those people are enormously experienced. They have been to the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Bougainville, East Timor and so on. I met some of them last weekend and spoke to them about the work they did in cleaning up the hospital in Banda Aceh. They were given an incredibly tough job which involved cleaning up the hospital, removing bodies and so on, but they did it and they did it well. As a result of that, through the public face of Australia in Aceh—our military, our civilian medical teams and so on—we have earned enormous goodwill. We saw the Australian Public Service at its best. There was a really coordinated response right across government.</para><para>For the National Day of Mourning and Reflection last January I was able to attend a service at the Somerton Park Baptist Church and later a multifaith service at St Peter's Anglican Cathedral, which was really moving and involved Hindu, Thai, Muslim and Christian representatives. Later this month I will be going to a dinner to raise funds for people in India and Sri Lanka at the Hindu temple in Oaklands Park, in my electorate.</para><para>As part of this response we have announced $1 billion to Indonesia over five years. I am very proud that we have announced this. It is very important in the administration of this that we do not lose the goodwill that our volunteers have gained in Indonesia. This money will attract all sorts of carpetbaggers and it is really important that we attract people who are working with goodwill and working to advance the way in which Australia is seen in this area. We have had something like 6,000 medical personnel register to volunteer in a tsunami area, and I think that is great. But I am concerned that we may see, with this, people who may lose us some of the goodwill that we have.</para><para>I would like to conclude by paying tribute to a constituent of mine who was visiting Sri Lanka when the tsunami struck. He was Sujeewa Kamalasuriya, a 39-year-old Adelaide businessman. He was originally from Sri Lanka and he moved to Australia in 1990. He lived in my electorate of Boothby in Melrose Park, and he became an Australian citizen about five years ago. He ran an Adelaide cleaning business. He was a keen cricketer—he represented Sri Lanka at the under-19 level and he played with the Adelaide High Old Scholars. He was snorkelling off Unawatuna Beach, south of Colombo, when the tsunami struck. His business partner, Sarah Roberts, was rescued but he unfortunately drowned. His body was later recovered and there was a funeral held in Adelaide in January. I would like to again give my condolences to all those who lost friends or family in the tsunami, especially to the friends and family of my constituent Sujeewa Kamalasuriya. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>147</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the House for the opportunity in this place to recognise the enormous loss of life in South-East Asia and to come together as a parliament in support of the devastated communities across the region.

The briefing was conducted by Professor Ian Webster, Chair of the AER Foundation. AER stands for alcohol education and rehabilitation. The foundation is an independent company that was set up in 2001 with a grant from the Australian government. Its charter is to enhance the capacity of the alcohol and other drugs sector to address alcohol and other illicit substance abuse and to promote the responsible consumption of alcohol.</para></talk.start><para>Qualitative research was carried out for AER by Quantum Market Research, and interviews were conducted in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia with people 16 years and over. Mr Daryl Smeaton, CEO of the AER Foundation, highlighted the fact that:</para><quote><para>... alcohol is a `sacred cow' in Australia. It is an intrinsic part of our social fabric with people reporting a gentle pressure to drink and that choosing not to drink can be confronting for those who do.</para></quote><para>Daryl Smeaton goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Individuals describe a reluctance to challenge people who are drinking to excess; the right to drink alcohol is linked to an individual's freedom.</para></quote><para>The research shows that here in Australia we have a huge problem caused by alcohol misuse, a problem that is increasing in severity and one which receives very little real funding compared with the massive amount of federal funding spent targeting illicit drug users. No other social problems result in such widespread harm to so many Australians. It is a fact that impulsive behaviour caused by excessive use of alcohol is a major factor in the following: 70 to 80 per cent of night-time assaults, 50 per cent of domestic and sexual violence, 50 per cent of deaths from assault, 44 per cent of deaths from fires, 35 per cent of industrial accidents, 34 per cent of deaths from falls and drowning, 30 per cent of all road deaths, 16 per cent of child abuse deaths and 12 per cent of suicides.</para><para>What do these percentages mean in reality? It is hard to believe that every year in Australia alcohol misuse contributes to around 3,500 deaths, the majority being avoidable accidents. A further 95,000 Australians are hospitalised. And what is the estimated financial cost of the problem to Australian society? A staggering $7.5 billion, and each and every one of us suffers that burden of harm. Australians need to be shaken awake from their apathy and confront the crisis that is affecting every aspect of our entire community.</para><para>And why do I say we have a crisis? The research highlights some frightening findings. I mentioned at the start of my speech that in Australian culture there is an acceptance that getting drunk is part of the Australian way of life. Drinking alcohol is seen as a rite of passage into adulthood. The frightening research findings are: nearly half of the respondents believed that getting drunk is an acceptable part of the Australian way of life; one in three believed that binge drinking is okay and that it is only a problem if you do it all the time; one in five believed binge drinking is okay as long as you do not embarrass yourself; one-third said it is okay to drink to excess at home or on special celebrations such as birthdays and anniversaries; and 21 per cent felt that you should not tell another person how much is too much when it comes to drinking. It is frightening, because there seems to be an acceptance of these beliefs. </para><para>Society accepts—nay, condones and encourages—its young people to become part of this binge-drinking culture. Remember what happens in schoolies weeks in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. Next week, across Australia, during orientation week at our universities we will see a week of alcohol abuse and alcohol excess.</para><para>Having a bronzed suntan used to be part of being Australian. However, the threat of skin cancer and the Slip, Slop, Slap campaign motivated more and more reasonable behaviour. If Australia can achieve a cultural shift away from the bronzed Aussie image where skin cancer incidences are reducing, then why, oh why, can't we do it with binge drinking?</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Flinders Electorate: Rural Support and Telecommunications Services</title><page.no>149</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>149</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to take this opportunity to announce a series of rural services which will assist the seat of Flinders and residents throughout Bass Coast, Westernport and the Mornington Peninsula, primarily in the area of rural support services and improved telecommunications services. I want to congratulate those individuals and community groups that have fought hard for these services.</para></talk.start><para>My first announcement is about the Grantville rural transaction centre. I am delighted to inform the House that the Grantville rural transaction centre will officially open on 19 March 2005. One month from now we will see a new centre opening on the main highway which will provide a range of new and enhanced services: (1) it will provide local government services (2) it will be a Centrelink access point (3) it will have Medicare Easy Claim facilities and (4) most important of all the different facilities, the Grantville transaction centre will include medical rooms. Already, thanks to the work of Bass Coast Shire Council, particularly Councillor John Hulley, who has done a tremendous job, and Helen Padalini, also from the Bass Coast Shire Council, there will be a doctor who will visit there on a part-time basis. That is a tremendous outcome and a great result for the towns of Corinella, Coronet Bay, Glen Forbes, Kernot, Almurta and, of course, Grantville and the town of Bass itself. On 19 March, along with a series of other facilities which come with it, the Bass Coast Shire Grantville rural transaction centre will be opened. That is great step forward. I want to congratulate all those involved—in particular, the community, led by Councillor John Hulley and Helen Padalini, and the broader community in general.</para><para>My next announcement concerns a series of mobile and broadband telephony services which have been increased or will be increased across Flinders. In relation to mobile phone coverage, Optus has installed 10 new mobile sites over the past two years. Significantly, it plans to improve mobile coverage within the seat of Flinders in at least eight areas over the coming two years in Blairgowrie Beach, Rye, central Rosebud, east Rosebud, the Osborne area of Mount Martha, central Moorooduc, Tooradin and north Lang Lang. There will be improved mobile phone coverage from Optus in all those areas. Similarly—and this is one of the benefits of competition—Telstra has increased and will increase both its broadband and its mobile coverage throughout the Mornington Peninsula and Westernport areas. It has done so over the last few years and will do so in the coming few years. Broadband—and I am delighted to say this—has recently been extended to Crib Point, Fingal, Flinders, Pearcedale, Shoreham, Warneet, Tyabb and Devon Meadows. Over the coming 16 months broadband is planned for Koo Wee Rup, Grantville, Corinella, Main Ridge, Red Hill, Tooradin, Newhaven and San Remo. All of those areas will have increased broadband services. I am delighted with the result and pleased to have been able to work with the community on those outcomes in each of those areas. </para><para>In addition to that, mobile coverage has already been extended in Ventnor, Anderson, Newhaven, Hastings, Cranbourne, Tooradin, Blairgowrie and Sorrento and will be extended to Rosebud, Cranbourne and Balnarring. Hopefully, it will also be extended to Shoreham, Boneo, Moondah Beach and other areas on the Mornington Peninsula. Taken together, that is a tremendous set of initiatives. I believe that we have made real progress. Something as simple as a payphone can make a difference to those who can neither afford nor have access to telephony within their own homes. There will be four new installations in our area that will be completed in the next 18 months. They include a new payphone for Eramosa Road in Somerville, Josephine Avenue in west Cranbourne, Point Nepean Road in Rosebud and also Mathis Avenue in Tootgarook, amongst others. Telecommunications and medical services are critical. On both of those fronts we are making tremendous progress. I am delighted to inform the House of this, and I thank the community. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Communications: The Ashes</title><page.no>150</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>150</page.no><name role="metadata">Livermore, Kirsten, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LIVERMORE</name><name.id>83A</name.id><electorate>Capricornia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to add my support to the growing number of calls for the upcoming Ashes series to be broadcast on free-to-air television. I am sure we all have stories from our families about our fathers or grandfathers sitting there wrapped up in a blankets on a cold winter's night in front of the old radiogram listening to the broadcasts of the Ashes tours of England in the fifties and sixties. In my family there is a story of my dad falling asleep on the floor listening to the test cricket coverage in the middle of the night. I suspect there are a number of members of this chamber who have similar memories of their introduction to Ashes cricket.</para></talk.start><para>The government needs to act, and act now, if it is to preserve those experiences in the lives of our current generation of young cricket fans. The government has itself acknowledged the importance of events like the Ashes test series to our sense of national identity and pride by including them in the antisiphoning scheme set up in the Broadcasting Services Act. The purpose of the scheme, we are told, is to protect the access of Australian viewers to events of national importance and cultural significance on free-to-air television by preventing pay TV operators from siphoning off television coverage of those events before free-to-air broadcasters have an opportunity to obtain broadcasting rights.</para><para>The problem is that the upcoming Ashes series has fallen through the gaps in the government's antisiphoning scheme and at this stage will only be seen by the 25 per cent of Australians who have access to pay TV. So far the government has adopted a hands-off approach which is totally indifferent to the concerns of ordinary sports fans in my electorate. For example, in answer to a question in the Senate on 18 November last year the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts said:</para><quote><para>The acquisition of broadcast rights is, I am sure all would agree, a commercial decision for the relevant broadcasters.</para></quote><para>The minister went on to say:</para><quote><para>Ultimately, the government would not as a matter of principle dictate day-to-day decisions on programming which are taken by either the national or commercial broadcasters.</para></quote><para>We are not asking the minister to do the networks' job for them, but we are asking the minister to do her job—that is, to protect the interests of the average Australian viewer like those in my electorate. The truth is that Channel 9 has grabbed so many exclusive rights to major sporting events that it cannot do justice to any of them. We have seen a fall in attendances at football matches and cricket matches because the public is not given enough coverage to maintain the public interest in these sports. Now with the Ashes we see the true damage done to our Australian way of life as this government allows our great sporting tradition to be used for profit by a few media moguls. </para><para>Last year, for example, my constituents complained that they were not able to see their favourite AFL team on free-to-air television. They did not understand why they had to give up their Friday night indoor bowls or other activities if they wanted to see their rugby league match of the round. You have to ask yourself: who decided to move the rugby league games? Who decided that Channel 9 would not take this year's Ashes tour? Who decided that regional Queenslanders could only watch Aussie rules after 11 p.m.? Of course it is the same people who stand to gain the most by forcing sports fans onto pay TV. Once again we see regional Australians suffering as this government does everything it can to give Mr Murdoch and Mr Packer everything they want.</para><para>At the moment the ABC are the only ones in there having a go. The ABC are negotiating over broadcast rights for the Ashes with the England and Wales Cricket Board, but they need help from the government to give them the best possible chance of securing free-to-air broadcast rights. In the Senate estimates hearings earlier this week Mr Russell Balding explained that the ABC could be assisted by the minister keeping the Ashes tour on the antisiphoning list—and not accede to the request by the English cricket board to de-list the Ashes series—and would like the parliament to consider lifting the genre restrictions on the ABC's second digital channel. Of course the ALP has gotten behind that call and is asking the minister to do those things to give the ABC the best chance possible of broadcasting the Ashes. The people of Central Queensland have had enough. They demand that this government does whatever is necessary to ensure the 2005 Ashes series is broadcast live and free to air for all Australians. Otherwise it will no longer be a question of the game never being the same but rather that the game will simple cease to be.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Human Rights in Darfur</title><page.no>151</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>151</page.no><name role="metadata">Laming, Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAMING</name><name.id>E0H</name.id><electorate>Bowman</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I acknowledge the member for Capricornia, who joins a long list of people from the opposition speaking about antisiphoning but coming up with simply no concrete solution to coverage of the Ashes series, except suggesting that somebody steps in or we protect the interest of Australian viewers.

Just eight years ago damage to the Australian way of life was no jobs, inflation, interest rates, collapsing businesses and no hope for ordinary Australians, and now damage to the Australian way of life is not having coverage of the Ashes series locked in a few weeks before the first test.</para></talk.start><para>I rise to continue my remarks from Monday on the ongoing humanitarian and human rights crisis in Darfur in Western Sudan. I am driven to make these comments because of my time on the Sudanese border just one month ago at a time when President Mubarak was announcing a package of aid and economic cooperation from Egypt for Sudan. It is of great concern to me that within that country, as one examines the current situation in Darfur, we are seeing shades of Rwanda—the great lesson in public policy of the last century about inaction and indecisiveness. Those atrocities in Rwanda ring loudly in the ears of anyone who was involved in international aid and reconstruction over the last decade. </para><para>The causes of this particular conflict are unique, but they have a familiar pattern. Competition back in the 1980s between the nomadic and mainly northern Arabic populations and the more stable grazing and farmland communities further south has led to an administrative system heavily biased in favour of the Arabic tribes, who control 19 of the 24 administrative areas. The Khartoum government has supported that and discriminated against and marginalised the African communities by providing support to the Janjaweed to suppress the non-Arab populations. Janjaweed is a colloquial expression which means `man with a gun on a horse'. These militiamen are primarily members of a nomadic Arab tribe who have lighter skin than their African counterparts.</para><para>Earlier this month, the United Nations special inquiry found that attacks by the Janjaweed militia were occurring with the acquiescence of state officials, and that is the problem: the notion of state sovereignty and whether we can intervene in situations like this. It flows on from 18 September 2004, when the United Nations Security Council passed resolution 1594 establishing a commission of inquiry and raising the possibility of sanctions against Sudan if it did not act to stop attacks against civilians and allow humanitarian agencies to do their good work without hindrance.</para><para>Jan Pronk, the UN's special representative, commented in his report that the el-Bashir government had failed to stop the Janjaweed. According to that report—and, again, doesn't this sound like Rwanda or echoes of the Congo, where there have been 70,000 deaths each and every year for two decades—there has been indiscriminate and widespread killing and bombing of civilians; the forcible transfer of 1.85 million Darfur civilians; the creation of 1.65 million internally displaced persons, with over 200,000 refugees fleeing across the border to Chad; the destruction of 2,000 villages and hamlets; the systematic perpetration of rape and violence, including abduction, torture and gang rape of women and girls; the plundering and looting of civilian property; the torture and inhumane treatment of civilians—and the list goes on.</para><para>The Australian government wrote to the President of the United Nations Security Council on 28 January this year, urging action to prevent further violence in Darfur. The Australian government has called for the introduction of targeted measures, such as individual travel bans and asset seizures, to bring pressure to bear on the parties. We know that these are important steps but of limited impact unless they are coordinated through the UN. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has already indicated that, if requested by the United Nations, Australia would consider sending assistance or a small peacekeeping force.</para><para>I commend the Australian government, and I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his continued support of humanitarian efforts in Darfur and for urging a cessation of violence. It is clear from those actions of Minister Downer that the Australian government is committed to supporting those international efforts fully to end this appalling tragedy. The echo of Rwanda in our ears is heard still and also that famous comment of our former foreign minister that there is no peacekeeping possible when there is no peace to keep—and I hope I have paraphrased him correctly. We must build consensus. We must ensure that we act before it is too late. Africa's ethnic and tribal disputes must not be considered as a matter of national sovereignty and ignored. The spill-over effect to other economies is substantial. The instability that leads to erosion and loss of physical, financial, human and social capital is enormous. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act</title><page.no>153</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>153</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to speak about the effects of section 21 of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and in particular about its effects and the unreasonable hardship it is causing to one of my constituents, Ian Emery, and his family, and to many other former public servants. Changes were made in 2001 to ensure that all federal public servants on compensation received 75 per cent of their former salary. The level of 75 per cent was promoted in the compensation scheme's charter. The changes to section 21 of the above act ensured that all federal public servants who remained on ongoing compensation payments received that amount of former salary. These changes fail to include Mr Emery or the cohort group that he belongs to of some 1,500 former public servants, some of whom are receiving as little as 40 per cent of former salary. Mr Emery received a voluntary redundancy package and remains on ongoing compensation payments because Comcare's support for invalidity and retirement was not accepted by the retirement benefits office.</para></talk.start><para>While sections 19, 20 and 21 under the SRC Act were originally introduced to avoid double-dipping—prior to 1988 officers were actually entitled to receive payments both from ComSuper and Comcare—it was at no time the intention of the original legislation to create further disadvantage to those falling within the provisions of sections 19, 20 and 21. Mr Emery's financial hardship is further compounded by the reduction of his wife's parenting allowance by some 80 per cent as a result of the CPI increases that Mr Emery is paid. It reduces his wife's payment by 50 per cent on each increase. This has effectively reduced Mrs Emery's parenting allowance from $370 to just $70 per fortnight.</para><para>The two areas of concern under the SRC Act which I would like to draw to the attention of the House are as follows: firstly, the deeming provisions for lump sum superannuation payments and, secondly, the discounting of the weekly compensation payments by five per cent to take account of the amount that the employees are required to pay as a compulsory contribution to superannuation. The only explanation for this deduction offered by Department of Employment and Workplace Relations is stated in their training manual—that is, `because it came out before'. It is simply that. There is no other reason. Just because it happened in the past, it continues to happen now.</para><para>Under section 21 of the SRC Act the deeming provisions for lump sum superannuation payments prescribe the application of a notional rate of 10 per cent per annum. Provisions apply when a person in receipt of compensation exits from employment under voluntary redundancy provisions and takes superannuation entitlements as a lump sum. To determine the notional weekly value of the superannuation lump sum benefit, it is divided by 520. This divisor assumes that over the long-term period invested at 10 per cent there will be a certain specific return. This rate was set in 1988 when interest rates were much higher. A former employee in receipt of both a compensation related payment and a lump sum has the amount of weekly payments reduced by the method set out, which I have just explained. Each year, therefore, it is assumed that the superannuation lump sum is generating an earning rate of 10 per cent. The fortnightly compensation payment, under the SRC Act, is reduced accordingly. Hence the inequality in what is taking place today.</para><para>For the past 10 years, Mr Emery's lump sum payment has been deemed with 11 per cent, which means a fortnightly deduction of $542 from his compensation payment. This has resulted in the recovery by the federal government of more than the total amount of $141,000 that Mr Emery had originally received in his voluntary redundancy package in 1994. Mr Emery's case is a special case, as he and his wife and three young children are not only financially affected by the impact of section 21 but his wife's parenting allowance is also reduced by more than $300 per fortnight. I am sure members everywhere in this House can understand the extreme hardship that this person and his family are suffering, along with 1,500 other former public servants who are treated in a very inequitable way by the provisions under this act, which can be fixed. It was never the intention of this act to do this to people. </para><para>For employees who continue to work, the five per cent deduction from their salary accumulates a benefit which is repaid as a lump sum plus earnings on retirement. In contrast, the five per cent deduction is lost to Mr Emery forever, which is contrary to the intention of the current legislation. The intention of this superannuation deduction is clearly spelt out in Comcare's letter to the Superannuated Commonwealth Officers' Association Federal Council dated 18 March 2002, which states that the deduction is meant to continue a benefit. It does not in Mr Emery's case or in the cases of those other people it affects.</para><para>The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations appears to have failed to recognise this fact. I have written to them, I have written to the minister and I will continue to pursue this injustice until this area is fixed. The situation can easily be remedied in three ways: first, by adjusting the 10 per cent deeming rate to deeming rates used by other government departments; second, by either stopping the practice of discounting weekly compensation payments by five per cent or placing contributions into the fund that accrues the benefit; and, third, by immediately supporting an act of grace support for superannuation deductions made for those no longer in the fund. I believe, as I believe all other members in this place would, that we need to make this right, because it is hurting people. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Herbert Electorate: James Cook University</title><page.no>154</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>154</page.no><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name><name.id>HK6</name.id><electorate>Herbert</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to say that James Cook University in North Queensland has done it again. James Cook is arguably now the leading regional university in Australia. Headquartered in Townsville, under the leadership of Vice-Chancellor Bernard Moulden, the university has powered ahead. Next week, after the conclusion of orientation week, university studies will begin and degrees in rehabilitation sciences will be available at James Cook for the first time. I am very pleased to say that the federal government has contributed significantly to these new degrees through the provision of some $6 million in capital to build a new rehabilitation sciences building.</para></talk.start><para>The building is state of the art. It will provide the best facilities of its type in Australia out of any of the universities in this country. It is a credit to James Cook University and to executive dean Professor Ian Wronski in what they have been able to achieve in the area of rehabilitation sciences. Many university buildings are just a set of walls and some windows; this building has been designed for the tropics and as a pleasant workspace. More than that, senior staff have been to other universities to take all of the best ideas and incorporate them in the new facility at James Cook. When the students enter the building next Monday, they are going to be delighted. The students themselves have voted with their applications. For every place that was available in the new courses, there were nine applicants. That is incredible and it is a great tribute to James Cook that students want to attend its rehabilitation sciences courses. </para><para>The new courses are integral to further developing high-quality tertiary education in North Queensland. Until now, students wishing to do degrees in rehabilitation sciences have had to go to Brisbane for their courses. I believe, as the university believes, that students who study locally will remain locally. It is particularly important in regional Australia that we have our fair share of scientists and practitioners to make sure that our community is properly serviced.</para><para>The degrees in physiotherapy and speech therapy came in response to the shortage of allied health professionals in Queensland, particularly in rural regions. The expansion of JCU's health and rehabilitation sciences degree has brought an extra 200 students to JCU. The degree headquarters will house a state-of-the-art sports performance measurement facility—the first of its kind outside a major Australian metropolitan centre.</para><para>But that is not all; James Cook has recognised there is more to do. We are already looking to the future, and in the next university year, starting in 2006, a new veterinary science course will begin. This will also be part of the health precinct that has been built at JCU. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you may say: why is veterinary science of interest in the health precinct? What it will be looking at and specialising in is the transfer of diseases in animals to humans, known scientifically as the process of zoonosis. We will see a tropical university looking at these sorts of things through a new vet science degree.</para><para>Then there is the tropical sciences research precinct which will be established. About $80 million will go into that. It is very exciting because it will be part of a collaboration and co-location with the reef CRC, Marine Science, CSIRO, the DPR&amp;F, BSES and so on. It is very exciting. In 10 years we will see James Cook in the top five research universities in the world for tropical sciences. It is a tremendous achievement from a university that in 1997 did not know how it was going to pay its salaries for the next week. Congratulations to James Cook University and its leadership. You have done well and you are going to do even better.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></maincomm.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions in Writing</type><title>QUESTIONS IN WRITING</title><page.no>156</page.no></debateinfo><para></para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Gambling</title><page.no>156</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 20)</subtitle><id.no>20</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>156</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Murphy</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 17 November 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Can the Minister confirm that unregulated foreign betting exchanges are using their websites to actively target Australians with sports and race betting products in competition with legal wagering offered by Australian companies thus depriving the Federal Treasury of GST revenue and the states and community groups of gambling tax.</para><para>(2)	Can the Minister confirm that one of the organisations involved in this new form of internet gambling, Betfair, now has a senior executive permanently stationed in Australia to directly promote this service to Australian gamblers.</para><para>(3)	Is it the case that unregulated betting exchanges allow multiple real-time bets on virtually any sport and any outcome; if so, does this development have the potential to increase problem gambling and corruption in sport.</para><para>(4)	Can the Minister confirm that in the UK, where betting exchanges originated, gambling activity has increased dramatically resulting in the British Racing Authority asking the UK Government to conduct a Royal Commission into the activities of betting exchanges.</para><para>(5)	Why has the Government not acted to crack down on the foreign betting exchanges.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>156</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McGauran</name><name.id>XH4</name.id><electorate>Gippsland</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Interactive wagering and lotteries are not prohibited under the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 (IGA).

The University did not inform me of its decision to suspend the 2005 intake into these courses prior to the announcements reported in the press. I cannot, therefore, confirm that it announced its decision on 18 November 2004 or if it consulted or notified its staff or students of the decision. I am, however, concerned about this matter and the way in which the University appears to have informed applicants. I wrote to the vice-chancellor, Professor Janice Reid, on 8 December 2004 expressing my concerns. I have also decided to include a clause in Funding Agreements from next year that will require all universities to negotiate with my Department before closing specialist courses such as these.</para><para>	The University has a notice on its website informing students that they can change their preferences with UAC at no charge if they wish to undertake an alternative course at UWS. Students had until 6 January 2005 to change their preferences to other UWS courses.</para><para>(4)	The University has said that it was not closing the courses but suspending the 2005 and 2006 intakes in order to undertake a course review. The suspension of these courses for those two years, however, may have an impact on the osteopathic and podiatric professions and the Australian Government is concerned about the possible outcomes of this move. I also note that representatives from the professions have expressed their concerns regarding the impact the suspensions will have on the future needs of the community.</para><para>(5)	Enrolment procedures are a matter for the University and the Universities Admission Centre (UAC). UWS informed students on its web site that they could change their preferences with the UAC at no charge if they wished to undertake any of the alternative courses suggested by UWS.</para><para>(6)	My Department will be monitoring this situation and will discuss this issue with the University in the next round of Funding Agreement negotiations. </para><para>(7)	My Department is developing a set of strategic principles for higher education priorities that will guide a national strategic approach to higher education provision across universities and help ensure the protection of national priorities. The principles will help inform the Government in how disciplines designated as national priority areas may be supported.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet: Domestic and Overseas Travel</title><page.no>172</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 326)</subtitle><id.no>326</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>172</page.no><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Quick</name><name.id>AV5</name.id><electorate>Franklin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 6 December 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	For the year 2003-2004, what sum was spent by the Minister's department on (a) domestic, and (b) overseas air travel.</para><para>(2)	For the year 2003-2004, what proportion of domestic air travel by employees of the Minister's department was provided by (a) Qantas, (b) Regional Express, and (c) Virgin Blue.</para><para>(3)	For the year 2003-2004, what was the actual expenditure by the Minister's department on domestic air travel provided by (a) Qantas, (b) Regional Express, and (c) Virgin Blue.</para><para>(4)	For the year 2003-2004, what sum was spent by the Minister's department on business class travel on (a) domestic routes, and (b) overseas routes.</para><para>(5)	For the year 2003-2004, what sum was spent by the Minister's department on economy class travel on (a) domestic routes, and (b) overseas routes.</para><para>(6)	For the year 2003-2004, what proportion of the expenditure on air travel by the Minister's department was on the domestic routes (a) Sydney to Canberra, (b) Melbourne to Canberra, (c) Sydney to Melbourne, (d) Sydney to Brisbane, (e) Melbourne to Hobart or Launceston, and (f) Sydney to Perth.</para><para>(7)	For the year 2003-2004, how many employees of the Minister's department had membership of the (a) Qantas Chairman's Lounge, (b) Qantas Club, (c) Regional Express Membership Lounge, and (d) Virgin Blue's Blue Room paid for by the department.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>172</page.no><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Howard</name><name.id>ZD4</name.id><electorate>Bennelong</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>I am advised by my department that;

Labor strongly supports the passage of the bill; the implementation of education standards pursuant to the Disability Discrimination Act is long overdue. It is an important step, and one which we had all hoped would have been taken long before now. In fact, this process began in the years of the Keating government—which demonstrates how drawn out the process has been and probably how complicated many of the issues are. </para></talk.start><para>We remain concerned, however, that the government has not looked at how the implementation of the standards can be funded. We dispute the fact that this bill will not result in any extra cost, and strongly believe that the Commonwealth government should put its money where its mouth is to support the important aims of the act and the introduction of the education standards to improve the position of, and opportunities for, disabled people in education and training.</para><para>The government has released a final draft of the standards, which are intended to clarify and elaborate upon the obligations of education and training providers in relation to students with disabilities. The standards will be tabled in parliament some time following the passage of this bill. The bill amends the act to support the draft education standards by: introducing and defining the term `education provider', providing that it is unlawful for education providers to discriminate on the ground of disability in the development or accreditation of curricula or training courses, providing that education providers may be required to develop strategies and programs to prevent the harassment and victimisation of students with disabilities, extending the defence of unjustifiable hardship in education to post-enrolment situations, and clarifying that disability standards made under section 31 may require reasonable adjustments to be made in order to avoid unlawful discrimination on the ground of disability.</para><para>Section 31 of the Disability Discrimination Act provides that the Attorney-General may formulate standards in relation to a number of areas covered by the DDA, including education of people with a disability. As I said at the start, work on these standards has been under way since 1995, with the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs being involved in two consultation processes with relevant stakeholders in 1997 and 2000. There is strong support in the disability sector for the standards to be introduced, to help address access issues for students with a disability and remove barriers to their full inclusion in the education environment.</para><para>The education standards must be implemented as quickly as possible to ensure access for students with a disability, but this will not be without significant cost. We strongly support the bill but I would like to place on the record our concern at the lack of consultation with the states, which will have the major responsibility for bringing education facilities up to standard. Our concern is not with the lack of consultation over the standards themselves but with the lack of consultation on their implementation and the cost of that implementation.</para><para>In the most recent Senate inquiry into this bill, several states made submissions contesting the Commonwealth government's view that there will be no financial impact upon the passage of the legislation and the introduction of the standards. We are therefore greatly concerned at the fact that the costs will fall heavily on the states—and the failure of the Commonwealth government to make a contribution is a significant issue.</para><para>In 2003, all state and territory members of the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs—except for Tasmania and the ACT—voted against the Commonwealth's move to introduce the standards. While they agree with the content and intent, the states and territories were not prepared to move forward unless the Commonwealth agreed to share the costs of implementation—which it is considered will be significant—and a phase-in of the standards.</para><para>The Commonwealth has moved unilaterally to have this bill passed and the standards introduced. There is strong support from education authorities and disability groups for the principles behind the bill. However several states are arguing that the cost implications are likely to be significant, and the Commonwealth is not providing any extra resources to assist with implementation. Clearly, this is worrying a number of those who have to provide the facilities and services on the ground. </para><para>It is clear that new subsection 31(1A), while it may require only minor changes to teaching practice or equipment provision, could result in major capital expenditure being required of an education provider. MCEETYA specifically raised this issue in the development of the standards as a possible impediment in the implementation phase. This government is clearly trying to steamroll the states in this cost-shifting exercise and has been unwilling to meet its responsibilities in sharing costs. While we are willing to accept the passage of this legislation, because we strongly believe in improving access for students with disabilities, we are gravely concerned that the money will not be available to make sure that the bill, once passed, and the standards, once introduced, will be able to work effectively.</para><para>There is also some concern from parent groups that the extended defence of unjustifiable hardship is a major trade-off for the other beneficial aspects of the bill—that is, that their children may in fact experience increased discrimination because underresourced schools will be able to enrol their children but continually refuse to make necessary adjustments for their full inclusion. This is a worrying area, where the issues of financing and principle interact with each other. Labor support the bill, but we call on the government to immediately undertake negotiations with state and territory education authorities and come to an agreed cost-sharing arrangement. Labor also reiterate the 2004 Senate committee's comments that the final education standards should be introduced as soon as possible.</para><para>In summary, we have some concerns about aspects of this legislation and its implementation but these concerns cannot override the very important benefits that this bill and the education standards will provide for disabled students. The goal to eliminate discrimination against people with a disability in education is enormously important. The right of every person and every child to an education is essential, and this parliament must do all it can to ensure that this right is available to everyone, regardless of any disability they may have.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>51</page.no><name role="metadata">Richardson, Kym, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RICHARDSON</name><name.id>E0B</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the <inline ref="R2209">Disability Discrimination Amendment (Education Standards) Bill 2004</inline>. My counterpart just mentioned the cost implication to a school. That school could perhaps apply for funding under the Howard government's direct funding for building alterations or infrastructure. The purpose of this bill is to establish a framework and legislative base which will give the best possible support to the education standards to be tabled in this parliament shortly. The Disability Discrimination Act 1992 allows the Attorney-General to develop disability standards in a wide variety of areas. One such area is the education of individuals with a disability. In June 2004 the government released for public information a final draft of the disability standards for education. These standards have been developed through extensive consultation with a wide variety of education providers, as well as with the disability sector and interested members of the public.</para></talk.start><para>The operation of the act differs marginally from the final draft of the standards, and that brings us to the specific achievements of this bill. The aim of this bill is to bring the legislation into line with those standards. The disability sector is eagerly awaiting the introduction of these standards, because they will finally provide the clarity and direction the industry so desperately needs in relation to students and prospective students with a disability. This government is dedicated not only to serving the disability sector but to doing so in the most effective manner possible. For that reason we have not introduced these standards without first seeking these amendments, for the simple reason that the industry and the community alike need the standards to be fully supported in legislation, without ambiguity, if they are to achieve their desired result. </para><para>The term `education provider' is used throughout the draft standards; it is a term used to describe educational authorities, institutions and organisations whose purpose is to develop or accredit curricula and training courses. The term `education provider' is neither defined nor used in the Disability Discrimination Act. This bill seeks to remove that anomaly, and to do so by defining the term with reference to terms already used and defined in the existing legislation. This bill also takes the very important step of making it unlawful for education providers to develop or approve any form of curricula or training course which would have the effect of excluding individuals with a disability from participation or which would otherwise subject them to detriment.</para><para>Individuals with a disability are not simply dealing with the physical impediments posed by their disability; they are also faced with the ever-growing challenge of overcoming the perceptions held by others and, in some cases, learning to deal with harassment and victimisation. This bill seeks to require education providers to become proactive in the prevention of harassment and victimisation. It will require providers to develop and implement strategies and programs which will prevent such behaviour, and to educate staff and students about the policies and the consequences if victimisation or harassment occurs. We are talking about a provision which ensures that a group who are already disadvantaged by circumstance are not further inhibited from accessing education because they are subject to the soul-destroying acts of others.</para><para>In proposing this bill, the government has not simply shifted the burden of preventing discrimination onto education providers. This bill provides for the extension of the `unjustifiable hardship' defence to cover post-enrolment situations, as well as curriculum development and accreditation, student support services and proposals for the elimination of harassment and victimisation. This bill affords education providers the ability to avoid provisions of this bill which would place the provider in a situation of undue hardship. The extension of this defence ensures that education will not be taking on the entire burden of eliminating disability discrimination in education.</para><para>Finally, this bill seeks to amend section 31 of the Disability Discrimination Act by allowing the disability standards to require reasonable adjustments to be made by education providers to eliminate, as far as possible, discrimination on the ground of disability. The Howard government made a public commitment in the joint statement by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Education, Science and Training on 15 June 2004. They made a commitment to the disability sector, to education providers and to the Australian people that they would introduce legislation which would ensure full legislative support for the draft disability standards for education. I stand before the House today to assist my government in delivering on that commitment. I increasingly meet with constituents in my electorate of Kingston who have a disability but who seek employment, and I regularly come in contact with service providers who place individuals with a disability into employment. The benefit to the community, to employers and to those individuals with a disability who obtain employment cannot be denied. I can tell you first-hand, Mr Deputy Speaker, that one of the major steps to ensuring higher levels of employment amongst this group is providing them with education. </para><para>This bill provides a base which will enable the disability standards for education to remove a massive roadblock currently preventing those with a disability from accessing education. The Howard government are dedicated to the education of Australians, and by that we mean all Australians. Australians with a disability face very real barriers when it comes to accessing education because those barriers are not always visible or obvious and they are not always dealt with. That stops today with the passage of this bill; that stops with the introduction of the disability standards for education. In the hope that it will make a difference in the lives of those with a disability, I commend this bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>53</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Congratulations, Mr Deputy Speaker, on joining the Speaker's panel.

At the outset, I want to say a couple of things about two schools in my electorate that do an outstanding job, along with many, many other schools. The first is Banksia Secondary College, which is a fantastic school. I remember being part of a most extraordinary end of year awards presentation at the school in which one of the school captains, Nick Brock, who is deaf, delivered his speech and ran the assembly using Auslan, and there was somebody there interpreting for him. It was an incredibly special afternoon, and a tribute to the wonderful efforts of the school. That school has a number of children with disabilities, some mild but some extremely disabling. There are some students with cerebral palsy and a significant number of students who are hearing impaired.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The second is the wonderful Rosanna Golf Links Primary School that has the regional deaf facility located within the school. It is a great tribute to the staff and the parents of Rosanna Golf Links to see the fantastic way in which the hearing impaired children are integrated into the school. There is separate learning time when there is very highly focused education for the children who are deaf, but they spend a lot of their time in the ordinary classrooms with all the other kids, and it is a wonderful thing to see the way in which they develop.</para><para>In both schools, one of the most special occasions is to see them all singing together. This happened while I was at Banksia, and I know it will happen at Rosanna Golf Links when I go there shortly to present their leadership awards. It is amazing to see the children using their voices to sing alongside children who are signing, whether the national anthem or other songs. It is a very moving experience.</para><para>It is very important that we support this legislation today to amend the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 so that we can have disability standards properly introduced into all of our educational facilities. I think it has taken far too long, frankly, for these standards to be introduced, so I am a very strong supporter of them going through this parliament. The whole purpose of the standards is to make sure the Disability Discrimination Act is being applied in our schools. Of course, the standards set out not only the rights of students but also the legal obligations of education and training providers. The standards provided for under the bill will detail how education systems have to meet their obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act. They are a very important step towards ensuring—not only in the schools I mentioned at the start of my remarks today but in every single school, TAFE or university—full participation in and equal access to education for people with a disability. </para><para>The disability standards will make sure that education providers take all reasonable measures to deliver equitable access to educational programs for students with disabilities. Providers will be able to claim unjustifiable hardship, such as the cost of capital upgrading or equipment, but I certainly hope the Commonwealth government, the state government and non-government providers of education do everything they possibly can to make sure these standards are met, because they are designed to protect the interests of students with disabilities.</para><para>The standards are all about making sure that students with disabilities have access to schools and other educational facilities so they can participate in the curriculum and related programs on the same basis as other children and young people. As is the case at Banksia Secondary College, schools have come a very long way over the last decade, but they do need additional support and guidance to make sure they provide equal access to people with a disability.</para><para>Compliance with disability standards for education is an important investment. We know that providing equal access is a very big task, because there are about 100,000 students with disabilities in our schools, both special schools and regular schools. Eighty per cent of students with disabilities attend government schools. The number of students with disabilities receiving integration support to help them in regular schools has grown significantly over the last decade—I think it has trebled.</para><para>So there has been a very significant increase in the number of students with disabilities being `mainstreamed' into government schools. It is probably the case now that almost every government school would have enrolled at least one student with a disability. State and territory governments provide over 95 per cent of funding for students with disabilities in government schools. As in other areas, the Commonwealth government is the major source of public funds for students with disabilities in non-government schools—in fact, over two-thirds of the public funding in those schools.</para><para>Students can have a very wide range of disabilities, whether it is intellectual disability, sensory disability, vision or hearing impairment, physical disability, one of a very wide range of social, emotional or behavioural disabilities, or developmental delay. It is often the case that students have multiple disabilities, and these are significant issues for students, teachers and parents to deal with in school. Some students also have other forms of disadvantage, whether it is isolation, poverty, being Indigenous, social deprivation or so on. We have a very significant challenge, particularly for the schools in those environments.</para><para>There are some students with disabilities who are still educated in special schools, and these special schools provide a very important educational environment for those students. There are about 20,000 students in these separate special schools—that is, about 15 to 20 per cent of all children with disabilities. The remainder are in our regular primary and secondary schools. Interestingly, about two-thirds are in primary schools. </para><para>I think everyone in this House knows that the students and teachers in schools, whether they are special schools or regular schools, certainly need extra support. Some of the students need in-class aids—of course, these are the students with more serious disabilities—to help them with their school work and often with other activities around the school as well. There are good systems in place in some schools to provide support through additional consultants who provide advice to teachers, additional print or ICT materials and a range of other integration supports. At each and every school that I go to, this is one of the major issues raised with me. Teachers are feeling under enormous pressure from the demands to respond positively to the needs of the increasing numbers of students with disabilities in their schools. Of course the teachers welcome these children into their classrooms, but I think we have to recognise that it puts a lot of pressure on the teachers. I am sure each and every one of us wants to do the best we can to help them. This area is crying out for more professional-learning programs. Teachers want to be better equipped to deal with the range of children with disabilities. Teachers want their knowledge, skills and teaching and learning methods expanded so that they can do their best by both the children with disabilities and the other children in the classroom.</para><para>We also could be doing better in our universities and TAFEs. About six per cent of people doing vocational education and training have a disability, including about 90,000 Australians with a disability at TAFE. There are about 24,000 Australians with a disability studying at our universities. That is about 3½ per cent of all of our Australian students. These disability standards are important not only in our schools but also at TAFEs and in universities so that young people and the mature aged are able to go on to get further qualifications and the skills they need to get a good job. Those students at TAFEs and in universities not only need their teachers to have the skills to educate people with disabilities but also particularly need access to equipment and curriculum materials so that they can succeed in their studies.</para><para>Parents with children who have disabilities also have particular needs. They probably need more time with their teachers, especially at school, to help with the education of their children. It is important for schools to have that extra time to develop individual learning plans for the children and to take account of the individual needs that different children have.</para><para>One of the big areas of expense is the capital adjustment schools and other educational institutions need so that students with disabilities can access schools, in particular, but also TAFE and universities. This applies to major capital areas, like lifts for educational institutions, and other areas, especially facilities for the hearing impaired and the visually impaired. All of these people need particular capital adjustments to be made so that they can participate in the teaching and learning programs that are available and be successful.</para><para>We need some system-wide reforms. Updated curriculum material and better production of equipment would also assist in many of our educational institutions. There has been some independent analysis, such as a paper by the Allen Consulting Group for the Department of Education, Science and Training and the 2004 report of the Productivity Commission. These reports support the development of standards but, most importantly, acknowledge that there are costs associated with the development of these standards. I do not think there is any doubt that implementing the standards will see future education and training of Australians with disabilities improve, but it is a cost that needs to be shared by the Commonwealth, the states and the non-government authorities. </para><para>We have had some warning about this. There was a Senate inquiry not long ago that warned the government of the challenges facing our educational authorities when they provide quality services for people with a disability. This inquiry reported in December 2002:</para><quote><para>There is unambiguous evidence of under-resourcing of programs aimed at bringing students with disabilities into the mainstream of learning; as well as funding inconsistencies between states.</para></quote><para>The committee reported `evidence that the proportion of students with an identified disability is increasing' at a much greater rate than the overall student population. One of the reasons for that is that there is much more effective early diagnosis and continuing successes in medical intervention. Both of these things are good developments, but it is adding to the cost of delivering education.</para><para>One area that the committee particularly reflected on was the better understanding of the nature of disability particularly, for example, in the area of autism. I am sure that many members have been in schools where there are children with autism. That particular condition provides challenges both to the staff of the schools and to the parents of the children who have that condition. The Senate committee made the important point that school authorities are moving from remediation, which used to be the way to early diagnosis and mainstreaming of programs. I have no doubt that these strategies will be much more effective in the longer run, but all of us have to face up to the resource pressures that are on our schools, TAFEs and universities now.</para><para>The committee made quite a few recommendations and I urge the government to have another look at the Senate inquiry's report and the recommendations that were made. I think they were all very practical, sensible recommendations that would have a very positive effect if the government took them up and introduced them. Unfortunately, we have not had that response from the government. We have this bill today, which I strongly support, but we do need to go further and to recognise that this government has a responsibility to share in the cost of meeting these standards. Unfortunately, when it comes to children in government schools, we have not had any funding above indexation for students with disabilities since 1996 from this government. That is certainly an area where we could do with some improvement. It is also the case that students with disabilities in nongovernment schools, particularly the more needy ones, are crying out for more support. I met with the Associations of Christian Schools this week and once again they raised this issue with me; they too have urgent needs. The 80 per cent of students with disabilities who depend on the public system could certainly do with increased support from this government, as could the students with disabilities in nongovernment schools.</para><para>Finally, I just want to touch on some other initiatives that we took to the last election because it is an area that I think that we could certainly do better in once these standards are implemented. We had particular initiatives both in government and in nongovernment schools. They included additional funding not only for capital equipment and ICT infrastructure, both of which are very important if we are going to meet these disability standards, but also for helping teachers in schools to deliver the intensive support that the students with disabilities in both regular and special schools need. Some of the things that we would have spent that money on were more teacher aides in classrooms, more time for classroom teachers to be able to provide personalised teaching, better professional development for classroom teachers and teacher aides, better equipment for students—particularly with physical and intellectual disabilities—and so on. I am very pleased to say that we did have a very comprehensive approach to this area but, all that having been said, I really do want to lend my strong support to the introduction of these standards. But I say to the government that to make these standards work and to make sure they are delivered in all of our educational institutions will require additional financial support from the Commonwealth. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>57</page.no><name role="metadata">Elson, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs ELSON</name><name.id>6K6</name.id><electorate>Forde</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very proud to speak today on this <inline ref="R2209">Disability Discrimination Amendment (Education Standards) Bill 2004</inline> that furthers the rights of people living with a disability. I note that this bill was first introduced in August last year but, of course, it lapsed when the election was called the following month. I commend the Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, for re-introducing it so quickly. The Howard government has worked hard since being elected to further support and improve opportunities for people with disabilities and to help and support their families to access greater respite and care services. Of course there is still more to be done, and I am working hard with the local organisations in my electorate of Forde to secure more funding for services in our region. This will be an ongoing battle, particularly when the state Labor governments are withdrawing services in some areas. I will outline that in detail later, but I am very pleased to be able to speak today on this bill, which goes one step further in enabling the introduction of the disability standards for education.</para></talk.start><para>Members of this House would be aware that before entering politics I worked as a coordinator for the Handicapped Association—now the Horizon Foundation—and Multicap, a service provider for people with multiple disabilities. In these roles I had the opportunity to see at first hand the daily struggles of people living with a range of disabilities, from mild to more severe. I gained a very deep understanding of their desire to be active, contributing members of their communities and to be accepted as a valued part of society. On a daily basis I learnt much from their constant displays of courage, their determination and their willingness to appreciate the true value of life.</para><para>Modern medicine advances have, fortunately, vastly improved the treatment of many conditions, thereby improving the quality of life of people living with a disability. It is estimated that around 20 per cent of Australians live with some form of disability. For some people this will mean an extra daily challenge, but essentially many people living with a disability are able to hold down full-time jobs, lead an active life and play a very important part in our communities. For others, their disability affects their daily life to a greater degree and they require a larger range of support services.</para><para>The most comprehensive data collected on the range of disability services provided by both the Commonwealth and the states is the recent Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report <inline font-style="italic">Disability support services 2002-2003</inline>. That report found that a total of $2.9 billion was spent in 2002 to 2003 on direct services for those living with a disability and their families. Accommodation support services accounted for 51 per cent of the total funding; community access services were 12 per cent; community support services, 10 per cent; employment services, nine per cent; and respite services, six per cent, or around $172 million. </para><para>As I said at the outset, our government has worked hard to deliver more services and assistance for people living with a disability, including the $1.7 billion Australians Working Together package, which offers more employment services and opportunities. Of course, education and training is a major factor in employment opportunities and advancement. Sadly, the Productivity Commission review of the Disability Discrimination Act found that exclusion from education and training is one of the most serious forms of disability discrimination. The setting of disability standards for education is expected to go some way towards addressing this inequity and setting out clear guidelines for the provision of education services.</para><para>Our approach with this bill, as always, is balanced. We want to improve access and make people with a disability more aware of their rights, while at the same time ensuring, through the provisions about unjustifiable hardship, that education providers are not unduly disadvantaged. It is a sensible and balanced approach, and I am hoping that the Queensland state government will take note.</para><para>Once again I am asking in this House that the Queensland Premier, Mr Beattie, look at the impact that the review of special needs funding by Education Queensland has had on disabled children and their families. Many disabled children had their teaching support seriously cut, which resulted in special needs children being placed in ordinary classrooms with little or no assistance. In late 2003, Education Queensland dropped the ascertainment level of nearly 1,000 disabled children, which in turn meant their teaching support was reduced or even entirely dropped.</para><para>At the special education development unit at Mount Warren Park, a school in my electorate, parents who do secure a place in this unit for their children have been dismayed to find that a vital service like speech therapy is virtually nonexistent. I repeat: the vital, basic service of speech therapy is nonexistent. We are talking about children aged from three to six years, a vital stage for speech development. These children are being denied access to speech therapy for whole semesters at a time. When they do have contact with a therapist, it is generally only for a very short period, one day a week—and that is only if they are lucky, as the parents tell me. Mainly the therapist conducts assessments, rather than actually working with the child to make improvements. As a mother, I can only imagine how frustrating this situation is for parents of children with special needs.</para><para>These parents have been fundraising like crazy to pay for an additional speech therapist to help their children, but, as this is only a small unit, that is an enormous task to ask of these parents. After all, we are talking about the basics here. As one parent put it to me, `Communication is the essence of our society.' If we cannot give our young children the opportunity to communicate to the very best of their ability, what chance do they have to overcome any difficulties they may face later on in life?</para><para>Despite ongoing representations from me and from parents—we even took petitions up—this situation remains unchanged. The local Labor state member, Margaret Keech, is unwilling or unable to do anything, and the state government just do not seem to be listening. They do not seem to be listening to her, the parents, me or our special needs support groups within our community.</para><para>I am hoping that, eventually, the introduction of the disability education standards will support our efforts to lobby the state government and add weight to the concerns of parents, who know the needs of their children best. It should not have to come to this. I should not be standing here once again. It is simply common sense to ensure that funding for speech therapy services for young children seeking to overcome development and learning difficulties should be allocated to this school so these parents' children at least get a chance in life. </para><para>Again, I ask the Queensland Premier to have Education Queensland urgently review the level of support and assistance available to children with disabilities, including those with mild impairment. These are often the ones who slip through the cracks, come out the other end of the system and—not having any support—have problems later on in life. This is a shocking situation. More resources clearly need to be allocated to help these special needs children. While various state governments try to dodge it, it is very clear that responsibility for the delivery of primary and secondary education services rests with them. They have a duty to deliver these services to everyone, including these people living with disabilities.</para><para>The Queensland government has received and continues to receive more funding than expected through GST revenue. It is worth noting that every cent of the GST goes directly to the states and territories to fund such things as roads, schools and hospital services. Every state and territory has received more than they expected in GST revenues in the past few years, yet they have failed to properly deliver the basic services that they really ought to deliver. The Labor Party are always big on their rhetoric when it comes to services, but their track record at state government level is one not just of inaction but of actually cutting funding for many vital services. The states really need to be brought to account.</para><para>Even in relation to this bill, several states tried to delay the introduction of the education standards. As the members of the Disability Discrimination Act Standards Project put it in their press release of 11 July 2003:</para><quote><para>We are disappointed that some of the States and Territories attempted to once again delay the introduction of the Education Standards.</para><para>To our delight, the Commonwealth Minister, Dr Brendan Nelson, has exercised his leadership. Dr Nelson recognises that after seven and half years of development, the Education Standards are now in agreement, and that legal and financial concerns have been resolved through independent inquiry.</para></quote><para>I, too, commend the minister and thank him for his leadership on this issue.</para><para>I am very proud to be part of a government that is taking the lead on these issues and that is working hard to improve these services and support the people who are living with disabilities. I look forward to working within government to secure more funding for effective programs. As I said, there is still more to be done in my electorate, but I will continue the fight down here for them. Unfortunately, I am going to conclude my speech very shortly because I am suffering from the flu and a sore throat, and I do not think it is going to do anyone any good for me to stand here coughing for the rest of this speech.</para><para>In closing, I would like to congratulate volunteers and providers of disability services within my electorate of Forde. They are all very dedicated and caring people. They work extremely hard to ensure that people and children with disabilities have a better and fulfilling quality of life.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>59</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON</name><name.id>DYH</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in favour of the <inline ref="R2209">Disability Discrimination Amendment (Education Standards) Bill 2004</inline>. As we have heard already, the bill proposes relatively minor amendments to ensure that the disability standards for education are supported to the greatest possible extent by the legislation. The standards do vary the operation of the DDA in some minor ways. Accordingly, the bill was prepared following legal advice that it is desirable to amend the legislation to remove any uncertainty and to avoid any potential challenges to its validity. </para></talk.start><para>The disability standards for education will be applied to government and non-government providers in all education sectors: preschool, school, vocational education and training, higher education and even adult and community education. They will also apply to organisations whose purpose is to develop and accredit curricula and courses—if you like, third-party providers. This is to ensure that these bodies consider the needs of students with disabilities up front in the design and accreditation of curricula which will be used by other schools and education providers. The standards cover the areas of enrolment; participation; curriculum development, delivery and accreditation; student support services; and the elimination of harassment and victimisation, to the extent that that is possible. These areas have been identified as covering all areas required for a student's access to and participation in education or training.</para><para>This legislation also provides reasonable adjustments to put students with disabilities on the same basis as other students. The standards recognise that to overcome the disadvantage arising from their disability students with disabilities need to be treated differently to remove or reduce barriers to their participation in education. The standards operate on the principle that students with disabilities should be provided with opportunities that place them on the same basis as other students so that they can achieve and realise their own potential in education and training. It is, of course, the goal of every parent in Australia to see their child achieve their potential, whether or not they have a disability or special needs.</para><para>To achieve this, the standards set out a process for determining and providing a reasonable adjustment. This is a measure or an action that enables the student to enrol and participate. As the forms of disability recognised by the act and the standards are wide ranging, in order to identify and make an adjustment which is appropriate to that student's disability education providers are required to consult with the student or their associate or parent. The consultation may also include an independent expert opinion to assist in that process. An adjustment is only required to be reasonable, and this is an important point. That is to balance the interests of all the parties who are affected, including the student with the disability, the school or education provider, staff and also other students.</para><para>I am advised that in any one year in Australia there are more than 200,000 students with a disability across all of the different sectors that I have described. This number is, interestingly enough, increasing over time. Definitions do vary across the sectors for reporting these statistics. In the school sector the number of students with disabilities is reported by the state and territory governments and non-government school authorities, while in the higher education and vocational education and training sectors students are self-identified. Notwithstanding these definitional issues, in 2003 there were 210,000 students with a disability across all sectors. It is important to note that the disability standards for education have the potential to make a significant difference by ensuring that all of these students can participate in education on the same basis as students who do not have special needs or disabilities.</para><para>With regard to Australian government support for the education of students with disabilities, I believe it is important to place on the record the excellent work that has been carried on by this government, not just in the current parliament but also previously, and to place on the record what has been achieved. Perhaps towards the end of my remarks I will identify some areas where more work is required. While, as we know, the primary responsibility for the provision of education and training rests with providers—and the Australian government is of course not a provider of education and training—the government does provide substantial assistance to state and territory and also non-government education and training authorities. This happens throughout the education sectors and, importantly, includes students with special needs and disabilities. </para><para>In the school sector the Australian government's financial assistance to the states and territories is significant. It is designed to improve the educational outcomes of all students, including those with disabilities, and is largely provided through three programs. Of these, the general recurrent grants program is the main source of Australian government funding and we have heard much about this, particularly towards the end of last year when the bill was passed, with an estimated $20.1 billion being provided to Australian schools in the 2001-04 quadrennium.</para><para>The Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes program, or SAISO, is the Australian government's major targeted funding program to improve the learning outcomes of educationally disadvantaged students in government and non-government schools. This is particularly the case in literacy and numeracy and for students with disabilities. Passed by parliament on 13 December last year was the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004. As we have heard, this will deliver a record $33 billion package of funding for Australian schools in the next quadrennium, 2005-08. This funding includes an estimated $2.1 billion for a new, overarching targeted program, the Literacy, Numeracy and Special Learning Needs Program, which will be targeted at the most educationally disadvantaged students, including those with disabilities.</para><para>In the vocational education and training sector, the Australian government has provided $1.15 billion to the states for VET in 2004. Under the national VET arrangements, responsibility for both public and private training systems lies with the states and territories. However, the Australian government has significantly increased VET funding for people with a disability, under its Australians Working Together welfare reform package, with an additional $9 million being available in 2004 for more training places and learning supports for people with disabilities. This will grow to over $11 million in 2005 and to more than $22 million in 2006, once the Senate passes legislation associated with this government's welfare reform package. The focus of activity in Bridging Pathways, a blueprint for improving opportunities for people with a disability, agreed to by state and territory ministers for training in June 2000, has been to improve the VET system's capacity to respond to the needs of people with a disability, including ensuring that resources and supports are available at the point of delivery.</para><para>In the higher education sector, universities are expected to provide the infrastructure and support that is necessary to ensure the best and the most effective participation for all their students—again, including those with a disability. In 2005, the Australian government will provide funds under the Commonwealth grants scheme of almost $3 billion for the provision of Commonwealth supported university places. As part of the Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future reforms, from 2005 the higher education disability support program will strengthen the focus of disability support in Australian higher education providers and increase that funding to over $6.5 million. This program consists of three parts. First, there is additional support for students with disabilities, which provides funding support to higher education providers to assist with the high costs that can be incurred in providing support and equipment to students with disabilities. The second part is the regional disability liaison officers, who will help to facilitate the transition from school to VET or higher education and then, hopefully, on to employment. The third part will be performance based disability funding support, which encourages higher education providers to implement strategies to attract and support schools with students with disabilities. </para><para>As I was waiting for my turn to speak just now I was listening to the remarks being made by the member for Forde about the level of support being provided to students across the sectors by the Queensland government. I had a great sense of deja vu as I reminisced about my years as a teacher in the state school education system in Tasmania. It was very disappointing to hear that it is happening in other states also. But, that being no surprise, this morning as I was talking with a Labor colleague on, I suppose, a collegial basis, they remarked that, even though they were in the same party as all of the state governments around Australia, despite that sense of camaraderie it was so difficult to get their state counterparts to pull their weight.</para><para>In closing, I would like to bring to the attention of the House the situation in Tasmania. Tasmania has a policy for students with disabilities which, I think, is complimented around Australia—that is, the policy of inclusion. Without going into the ideological arguments for or against inclusion—I am not about to do that today—it is important to note that inclusion has been sold to the community, and even to parents, as providing a choice for children. That choice is said to be between going to a special school—or, if you like, a specialist school for students with a disability or special needs—and going to a mainstream school. That choice is very important. It should not be lost on those of us in parliament or in the community who are not necessarily parents or, indeed, parents of children with special needs that it is in fact not the politicians, the teachers or the principals who care most about the students concerned—it is the parents. They, after all, are the ones who brought the children into the world. Undisputedly, they are the ones who love the children and have their welfare at heart the most. Hence, the choice is so important. I would argue that the implementation of the inclusion policy in Tasmania has utterly removed that choice.</para><para>I witnessed students come into my classroom, say, in grade 8 of high school, having come from a specialist school, and they struggled. They found it difficult. In my own extended family, I have a similar story where the child and parents were put under great pressure by the educational authority to move the child from a specialist school, where the classes were small, the teaching assistance was intensive and where the care factor was so very high. The school had teachers specially trained just for the purpose of teaching children with a disability. That is not to say it was easy, but it was a specialist environment and a very nurturing place for the child. They were pressured to go to what we shall call a regular mainstream school, such as mine.</para><para>That being the case, and being the case with many different students, it has had a great result in changing the profile of each of the two school sectors. This has meant a reduced resource base available to special schools. By continuing to put pressure on parents and students to move from specialist schools into mainstream schools there was, of course, an impact on the funding arrangements for each school concerned. The specialist schools had fewer students, therefore they received less funding support, less teacher allocation and less resourcing in terms of programs available to the students who were left. It also allowed the government to argue later that there was reduced demand in these specialist schools. That is the great hypocrisy of what happened. First arguing that there was a reduced demand on these schools, they then made a case that some of these schools should be closed down. Over time, the choice available to parents, even for that small community of parents and students, was diminishing and being eroded by the day. That has made me extremely angry. I think it has made a lot of parents in Tasmania very angry. </para><para>It breaks my heart to hear that it is happening all around Australia, because of state governments who are negligent, who do not seem to care about the students given to their care and who I think are showing a great disregard. It breaks my heart because I see that schools in my electorate—like St Michael's school and like St George's school—are being treated like cannon fodder for education authorities who do not want to spend the money. They do not seem to want to appreciate—just because they have a nice, cushy life on a politician's salary—that other parents and students find it more difficult and that their needs are just as important. I think that is a great tragedy.</para><para>I welcome the amendments to the Disability Discrimination Act in that they again reinforce that notion of choice and real support being given to students who need it. I think that if we do not know someone ourselves or if we do not have someone in our own family who suffers from a disability or who has a special need, we forget sometimes in this place what it must be like. I do not think we do appreciate what it could be like to live with that day by day. Of course the school day is just a small fraction of the time of a child's life, most of it being in the care of their parents. I would today call upon all state and territory governments to rededicate themselves to providing real choices to parents, to providing real support to students who need it and to providing a real future for these students.</para><para>I made the comment earlier in my contribution that really the goal of every parent is to see their child achieve their potential. Today I do not propose to know exactly how to measure that for each child. We are all different and our children are all different. I just argue that parents, being the ones who love their children the most, ought to be given more flexibility and more support. I think that there would be nobody in this place who would disagree with the basic tenets upon which I have based my argument. I call upon the state government to review the level of funding support and structural support available to this very important sector of the educational program in Tasmania.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>63</page.no><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PYNE</name><name.id>9V5</name.id><electorate>Sturt</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker McMullan. I have not seen you in this role before, so I welcome you to the chair. I would like to thank the members of this House who have taken part in the debate on the <inline ref="R2209">Disability Discrimination Amendment (Education Standards) Bill 2004</inline>, particularly the member for Gellibrand and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Importantly, for the heartfelt and intelligent contributions on our side of the House I thank the new members for Kingston and Bass and the member for Forde. I thank them for the role that they played in the debate.</para></talk.start><para>The Disability Discrimination Act 1992 provides that the Attorney-General may formulate disability standards in a range of areas, including the education of persons with disabilities. There are already disability standards governing accessible public transport. These came into effect in October 2002. It is clear that the transport standards have already benefited people with a range of disabilities, as well as other members of the public, including the elderly and parents with prams. Draft standards for access to premises were also released for public consultation in 2004. Under section 31(2) of the Disability Discrimination Act, disability standards formulated by the Attorney-General must be tabled in parliament. Once they are in effect it is unlawful to contravene a disability standard. The purpose of disability standards is to clarify and elaborate the obligations imposed by the Disability Discrimination Act. </para><para>The draft disability standards for education have been developed over many years. Their development has involved extensive consultation with government and non-government education providers, the disability sector and other interested members of the public. In June 2004 the government released for public information a draft of the standards, along with accompanying guidance notes to assist in their interpretation. The draft of the standards differs from the operation of the act in minor ways, so it was necessary to make these amendments to the act to ensure that the standards are properly supported.</para><para>In particular, this bill will amend the Disability Discrimination Act to introduce and define the term `education provider'; provide that it is unlawful for education providers to discriminate on the ground of disability in the development or accreditation of curricula or training courses; extend the defence of unjustifiable hardship in education to post-enrolment situations; clarify that disability standards may require reasonable adjustments to be made in order to avoid unlawful discrimination on the ground of disability; provide that education providers may be required to develop strategies and programs to prevent the harassment and victimisation of students with disabilities; and clarify that education providers may not be excused from complying with a standard of education on issues relating to programs that prevent harassment or victimisation on the ground of unjustifiable hardship. When implemented, the draft disability standards for education will specify how education and training are to be made more accessible to students and prospective students with disabilities, without imposing unduly onerous burdens on education providers. They will clearly describe the obligations of education providers in relation to students with disabilities, and provide guidance on how to meet those obligations.</para><para>This bill was referred for inquiry and report to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The Senate committee reported on 8 December 2004. A majority of the committee recommended the bill be passed without amendment and urged the government to introduce the final education standards into parliament as soon as practicable after the passage of the bill. The bill was then passed by the Senate without amendment. The support for the passage of the bill has been very positive, and we thank the Senate.</para><para>There have been a few issues raised in the debate by the member for Gellibrand and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The first of those has been the costs of implementation of disability standards for education, which I would like to deal with. The standards and the amendments to the Disability Discrimination Act make it clear that education providers will not be required to make adjustments for students with disabilities if those adjustments would cause them unjustifiable hardship. As the regulation impact statement shows, there should be no, or very minimal, additional costs incurred in implementing the education standards if providers are already meeting their obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act. </para><para>The government already provides substantial assistance to the states and territories and non-government education and training authorities in all education sectors, including for students with disabilities. The funding includes an estimated $2.1 billion for a new overarching program of literacy, numeracy and special learning needs to be targeted at the most educationally disadvantaged students. I very strongly support this. My father was the founding vice-president of SPELD in South Australia. SPELD is the specific education learning difficulties non-government organisation, which was established by my father in South Australia and around the country in 1975 or 1976 because one of his children suffered from dyslexia. I digress momentarily. My father was made father of the year for South Australia in 1975 because of his work with SPELD and specific learning difficulties. I very strongly support the role of the government in providing that money and support for people with learning difficulties.</para><para>Another issue that the member for Gellibrand and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition raised was the possible undesirable consequences of extending the defence of unjustifiable hardship. The government is keen to ensure that, when they are formulated, the disability standards for education reflect an appropriate balance between the interests of a student or a prospective student with a disability and the effects on the education provider of making an adjustment to accommodate the student. At the moment, it is only possible for an education provider to claim unjustifiable hardship at the point of enrolment of a student with a disability. The amendment in this bill to extend the defence of unjustifiable hardship beyond the point of enrolment will avoid the undesirable effect of discouraging educational institutions from admitting students with disabilities because they are concerned about the potential future costs of accommodating the student. The experience has been that some educational institutions refuse enrolment on the basis of potential concerns about disability when, if they could enrol students and see how they go, the institution may find they did not have any difficulties that would have precluded their being enrolled in the first place. This is an important step.</para><para>This bill will clear the way for draft disability standards for education, which have been the product of extensive consultation with industry, government and disability sector representatives. The standards are a practical way of clarifying the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act. They will provide certainty for education providers about their obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act, and they will clarify the rights of people with disabilities with respect to education and training. There is no doubt that one of the key issues that members of parliament deal with that is heartfelt and heart-rending for all of us is the difficulties that people with disabilities face that those of us without a disability have not had to face. I was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services for 12 months, and I listened to many very difficult and challenging stories from parents who are trying to help their children have as normal lives as possible.

Yesterday when I was speaking I was interrupted by the adjournment. Yesterday in the Main Committee I was talking about the outstanding work carried out by the University of the Sunshine Coast and the tremendous progress that that institution has made since it was established in 1994. The member for Fairfax and I went to see the then education minister, Dr Kemp, with a view to allowing the university to become a fully independent institution. This occurred in 1999, when the university changed its name to the University of the Sunshine Coast. Since that time, it has gone from strength to strength. The current Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, has been to the university. He has spoken with the key stakeholders at the university, and I have to say that the university owes him a very great debt because of the strong support that he has given to the University of the Sunshine Coast.</para></talk.start><para>I pointed out in the Main Committee yesterday that, between now and 2008, the University of the Sunshine Coast has been allocated 1,080 new places out of a total of 6,500 new places allocated to the state of Queensland. In fact, 395 new places have been made available for this academic year. Of the 1,080 new places, 328 will go to secondary teaching. Other disciplines to receive substantial increases in places include business, 205 new places; enabling sciences, 137 new places; human movement, 150 new places; and human welfare, 96 new places. New places will also go to nursing, health promotion and communication media studies.</para><para>These new places have been allocated to a wide number of disciplines, which is a great thing. This means that the university will be able to offer a wide range of courses and will become a much more attractive place for students to attend as students will be able to study a wide range of subjects in a wide range of degree courses. The breadth of disciplines is indicative of the university's innovative approach and the Howard government's support for students' learning across all disciplines. </para><para>Part of the university's success lies with the very high calibre of staff employed by the university, which ranks No. 1 among all Queensland universities and fifth among all Australian universities in proportion to full-time academic staff with PhDs and higher degrees. This extremely high level of professionalism is reflected in the documented graduate satisfaction rate of 92 per cent from students' university experience. I have met many of the students from the university, and I am impressed with the calibre of person the university is releasing into the community to perform worthwhile work on behalf of their fellow community members. I am personally proud of this institution. It is a university that will go from strength to strength, and it is a university we can all admire.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>67</page.no><name role="metadata">Elliot, Justine, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs ELLIOT</name><name.id>DZW</name.id><electorate>Richmond</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is a crisis in aged care and the <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline> does nothing to rectify it. After nine years of underfunding and neglect, the government remains complacent about fixing the problems. Red tape, a funding shortage, a lack of facilities and staff, and differing standards of care are always issues that come up when people speak to me about aged care. Nowhere are the problems more obvious than in the electorate of Richmond. One in four people living in Richmond is over 65 and thousands of people retire to the electorate every year. They come to Richmond looking for a better lifestyle. We can certainly offer them that—beautiful beaches and a relaxed and friendly environment. Unfortunately, they also often find a lack of infrastructure and underfunded aged care facilities that are unable to meet their needs. That is what nine years of neglect by the government has given them. The government had simply failed to put resources where they are most needed—in areas like the North Coast of New South Wales. If our elderly want to retain their independence, they find that they are unable to access some basic assistance to help them stay in their homes.</para></talk.start><para>Our older Australians have made a tremendous contribution to our society. It shows a total lack of respect from this government that our seniors are not being cared for properly. The government has taken the support of older Australians for granted. They think that this is a licence to neglect aged care in Australia. The government's record on aged care is not a good one, particularly in my electorate. Waiting lists for aged care beds in Richmond have blown out. Our hospital wards are filling up with elderly people who cannot get into an aged care bed because there is simply not one available. There is a six- to seven-month waiting list for CAPS packages that provide vital home care—home care that allows our local elderly to maintain their independence.</para><para>In 1990 there were 250 referrals to CAPS across my electorate. By 2004 there were 1,800 referrals. In January alone this year, there were 190 referrals. The government is failing to keep up with this level of demand. Locally, we received just 180 CAPS packages, which provide seven hours a week home care. That is one-tenth of the referrals. It is obvious to me and my community where the demand lies, yet the government has failed to act on its responsibility to older Australians. That is why I have decided to hold a local aged care summit. The summit will bring together local aged care and health experts as well as elderly residents of Richmond. I want to hear from them about the aged care needs of my local community and I want to work with them to find solutions to the current problems facing the aged care sector in my local community. That is also why I fought so hard to get on this parliament's health and ageing committee. It is important to elderly people in my electorate and their families that the government is held accountable for the decisions they make regarding aged care. </para><para>The government have become so complacent on aged care that they have failed to provide the necessary funding. I would be happy for the Minister for Ageing to come to Richmond to see the need for herself. She could visit any one of the nursing homes in my electorate and see first-hand the problems in aged care. They could tell her about the number of people who are waiting to get into an aged care bed and they could tell her about their staffing problems and the problems they have with red tape—the time they spend away from caring for residents, filling in paperwork. I am happy to work with anyone—across party lines and at all levels of government—so that elderly people in Richmond are well cared for. In my view, this is an issue above politics. It is about care and respect for the senior citizens who have contributed so much to our community.</para><para>Just last week the National Aged Care Alliance, the peak representative body of the aged care industry, released a paper urging the government to address the funding problems in aged care. The alliance is made up of health professionals, the elderly, unions and aged care providers. These are the aged care experts. If the minister ignores their recommendations, she is ignoring the problems faced in the aged care sector. The alliance has compiled a list of major problems that the government needs to address, including insufficient funding, a failure to provide for older Australians with special needs and proper training for staff. I was encouraged to see that the shadow minister for aged care has taken on board their recommendations and will continue to consider them closely.</para><para>I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the staff of my local aged care facilities. Over the past two years I have had the opportunity to visit several of my local nursing homes. During every visit I meet dedicated and caring staff who work hard to provide for our seniors. Unfortunately, the government ties them up in red tape. Instead of caring for our elderly, they are forced to spend their time bogged down in paperwork. Professor Warren Hogan, author of a $7.2 million government report into aged care, agrees. He thinks that there needs to be a complete overhaul of aged care legislation. Let us hope that the $7.2 million the government has spent on this report does not go to waste. My fear is that Professor Hogan's report will gather dust on a shelf in the minister's office. I urge the Minister for Ageing to look carefully at Professor Hogan's report—a report she herself called:</para><quote><para>One of the most expansive and detailed reviews of residential aged care ever produced.</para></quote><para>I know that the message from my community to the minister is: act on this report immediately and make the changes that the Hogan report recommended. Instead of ignoring the experts, it is time the minister listened to what they and the community are saying. The time to fix our aged care system is now. Older Australians deserve the very best care available.</para><para>The government's complacency over the past nine years has left the aged care system in an absolute shambles. I will always support sensible proposals to improve quality, affordability and access to aged care. I am always willing to work with anyone to get a better deal for seniors in Richmond and I will continue to push the minister to fix the problems created over the past nine years—problems created because the government has simply ignored the needs of older Australians. </para><para>The lack of aged care beds and suitable home care arrangements for our elderly creates problems in the wider community. I know of many cases of elderly people who are forced to stay in hospital because there is no aged care bed available. Some are going to the emergency ward because they cannot afford to see their GP. That is why I secured a commitment from the Minister for Health and Ageing for an after-hours GP clinic for Tweed. I understand that tenders have been called for. That is positive news for Tweed families.</para><para>Tweed Hospital has the second busiest emergency ward in New South Wales outside of Sydney. Our community—from the elderly to young families—relies on Tweed's emergency department. The government's changes to bulk-billing have meant that it is harder than ever to find a bulk-billing doctor. This means that people are forced into the emergency department of the local hospital, particularly in the case of elderly people on fixed incomes. Some simply cannot afford to get sick. That is why an after-hours clinic is so important; it will provide a bulk-billing doctor to take the pressure off our local emergency ward.</para><para>Another major concern of elderly people in my electorate is this government's decision to cut the Commonwealth dental scheme. The minister for health himself has said in relation to Labor's dental health scheme, and I quote:</para><quote><para>The Keating government's program did reduce waiting times, no doubt about that ...</para></quote><para>If he agrees that this system worked, why doesn't he restore the funding to public dental health his government tore out nine years ago? There are only about 240 public dentists to cater for more than 2.5 million health care card holders, children and the elderly. This compares with more than 3,000 private dentists to treat the rest of the population. I have met many elderly people who were unable to eat solid foods because their teeth were so bad and they were unable to see a dentist. The government cannot wash their hands of this crisis. Providing public dental care is an obligation that this government have failed to meet.</para><para>I agree with the member for Moncrieff, who said on Monday that our public dental scheme was third world. I agree because I have seen first-hand elderly people in pain and waiting for a dentist. In Australia in 2005 this should not happen. Again, it shows a complete lack of respect and a disregard for the needs of elderly Australians. Public dentists are doing everything they can; they just are not getting the support they need from this government. It seems that the Prime Minster and the minister for health are content to leave elderly Australians with severe dental problems to suffer. They are not training enough dentists to meet the demand and they are not providing the support that public dentists need to meet the demands of their patients. This is not something that the government should be allowed to ignore. Public dentists provide an invaluable service to our community. This government have an obligation to meet the dental health needs of our community. They are simply not meeting that obligation.</para><para>The care of veterans in our community is also an important issue in my electorate. A number of veterans have contacted me recently concerned about the indexation of payments for veterans who are totally or partially incapacitated. This is an important issue for all veterans who served in the world wars, Vietnam or in more recent campaigns. I am particularly concerned about this issue because a number of veterans who live in my electorate are being unfairly treated. The issue arises because the TPI payment is indexed only partially to male average weekly earnings. Other pensions and payments are indexed fully. This means that people receiving an aged pension or unemployment benefits are, in a sense, better off than our veterans </para><para>The Prime Minister and Minister for Veterans' Affairs never miss an opportunity to talk about their respect for veterans and the contribution they have made to our country. But, as the saying goes, actions speak louder than words. These veterans were injured so badly defending our nation that they can no longer work. It is only right and fair that the government provide adequately for them. The government's refusal to index these payments fairly means that the livelihoods of these veterans are slowly eroding. The federal government's bandaid solution of partial indexation has slowed the erosion, but it will not stop it completely. These men and women served our nation with distinction. The federal government's blatant disregard of the needs of veterans is absolutely appalling. Our veterans deserve better from the federal government. They do not expect any more than what is fair; and that is precisely what they should get. I call on the Prime Minister and veterans' affairs minister to act immediately to rectify this gross injustice.</para><para>Our elderly Australians deserve to be taken care of properly. The contribution they have made to our community is one we should all be grateful for. We can show that gratitude by taking care of them well. This government has taken elderly Australians for granted for far too long. This issue is about showing a basic level of respect for the contributions of elderly Australians—and the government should be working to find solutions to these problems instead of just watching from the sidelines.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>70</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to speak on the <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline>. In the five minutes afforded to me this afternoon prior to question time, I would like to focus on the issue of roads in the electorate of Paterson. I was awoken this morning by one of my media outlets that informed me that last night there was, yet again, a serious smash on the Tea Gardens turn-off on the Pacific Highway. Work is under way now—thanks to the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Mr Lloyd, who provided support and assistance—to upgrade the Pacific Highway between Karuah and the Viney Creek turn-off. One of the key issues in the development of this road, planned for by the New South Wales state government, is that there has been absolutely no allowance for a flyover.</para></talk.start><para>The accident occurred last night simply because a vehicle had to go across the oncoming traffic, which was only doing 90 kilometres an hour. There was a collision and a person is now in a serious condition in hospital. As this road is upgraded we are going to see vehicles travelling past this intersection at 110 kilometres an hour. If a car is travelling with a caravan attached—because the Hawks Nest-Tea Gardens area is an extremely popular tourist destination—canvassing a vehicle with a caravan on the back in front of vehicles doing 110 an hour defies any logical stance on safety. I will be writing to Mr Costa this week urging him, as the new roads minister in New South Wales, to have a look at this intersection. Communities in my electorate such as North Arm Cove, Tea Gardens and Hawks Nest are up in arms at the state of the planning for this road.</para><para>Prior to the election, I had Minister Lloyd up to see the commencement of works at Nabiac. That is a section of road from Bundacree Creek right through to Nabiac. There is supposed to be a community consultative group for issues pertaining to these roadworks. The state government has established these community consultative groups in name only because each and every time these community groups go to meet with the RTA they meet a stonewall approach. I believe it is time that the planners and developers who look at this road infrastructure in New South Wales, the RTA, take into serious consideration the accident rates that occur when you do not have a flyover in place. Every time I hear of an accident or a fatality on these roads in my electorate it drives straight through me because I can feel the pain of those who are left behind and suffering. I urge the state government in New South Wales to seriously reconsider the planning approach that it takes to the upgrading of the highway, and in particular the approach it takes to flyovers in the region. </para><para>We were very fortunate during the election that the Prime Minister decided to invest an additional $10 million in roadworks in Paterson. This road work will include the works between Dungog and Raymond Terrace and an area on Lakes Way near the Seal Rocks turn-off. We were caught out by the state government in the 2001 election when we committed $20 million to the Bucketts Way. We expected that the New South Wales Labor government would do the honourable thing and match the $20 million that we were investing on a state road. They did not. So the $10 million that we have committed to these roads in the Paterson shire has a riding clause that it must be matched by the New South Wales government. We will wait and see whether they treat roadworks and motorists' safety as a priority.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

The National Water Initiative is the greatest single initiative to address the problem of water shortage in our country for generations. I welcome the fact that at last we have an expression of commitment to that initiative from a political leader from Western Australia because, when the initiative was signed, the Premier of Western Australia, Dr Gallop, held out and thereby denied to the farmers of Western Australia the opportunity to participate. The Leader of the Opposition asks me specifically why a provision relating to full cost recovery was included. I would, in addition to what I am about to say, examine the papers relating to that decision to see if there were further things, but I would have thought, if we are to have any kind of hope of dealing with the problem of water shortages in this country, we have got to in the future send more accurate market signals. </para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Kyoto Protocol</title><page.no>72</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>72</page.no><name role="metadata">Turnbull, Malcolm, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TURNBULL</name><name.id>885</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

I know he and most members—probably all members—of this House share the view that climate change is an issue that has to be addressed. The international community needs to address this issue. But it is the view of this government that the problem with the Kyoto protocol is that it does not address the problem. If you actually look at what the Kyoto protocol is intended to achieve, it is intended to reduce global emissions by just one per cent below what they would have otherwise been within the target period. In other words, emissions will still be some 40 per cent higher in 2010 than they would have been in 1990. I think, if the public and the international community were aware of this, they would be less enthusiastic about Kyoto. The international community is right: the issue of climate change must be addressed. But Kyoto is not addressing it.</para></talk.start><para>The Kyoto protocol has set targets—but how are countries going in meeting those targets? Of the countries with targets, at the moment the current projection is that Canada will be 25 per cent above its target. Yes, it has ratified the Kyoto protocol, but it will be 25 per cent above its Kyoto target. Japan will be 13 per cent above it; Denmark, a member of the European Union, will be 38 per cent above its Kyoto target; and Ireland, 27 per cent. If you take all 25 countries in the European Union at the moment, the projection is that they will be some eight per cent overshooting their target.</para><para>The point here is: if the Kyoto protocol is such a great idea, why is it doing nothing to address climate change? Our answer to that is that in this country we are spending $1.8 billion to address this issue and we are on target—we are on, if you like, our Kyoto target. So, whilst we do not believe in the Kyoto process for very good reason, because the Kyoto process is not working and is not workable, nevertheless we are able to make a substantial contribution ourselves to addressing this issue. It is the view of this government that the international community needs to get together and work through ideas which will seriously address this problem, not resort to the sort of stuntsmanship that we have seen from the opposition on this issue over the last few days, and ensure that the international community is driven more by substantial policy outcomes than the mere symbolism which is all that Kyoto amounts to.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economy: Interest Rates</title><page.no>73</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>73</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

Without in any way denigrating the contribution of those Australians who live in Western Australia, let me say that the strength of the Western Australian economy—which is undoubted—is due overwhelmingly to the economic policies of the coalition government, just as the strength of the Queensland economy, the strength of the New South Wales economy, the strength of the South Australian economy and the strength of the Tasmanian economy are.</para><para>The message that I would like to convey is that Western Australia could be doing even better if it had a state government that followed policies that were more supportive of the national government in a number of important areas. Let us take the very important area of industrial relations. The rate of working days lost in Western Australia due to industrial disputes has trebled since the year 2001. By June 2004 Western Australia's rate of 121 working days lost per thousand employees was almost twice the national average of 67. It is right to say, as Western Australian premiers of both political complexions have said to me over the years, that Western Australia may have only 11 per cent of the population but it contributes 28 per cent of the export income of the nation. It is also fair to say that there is no reason that Western Australia cannot have an industrial record the equal of the national average and the equal of the best that is achieved around Australia. That can happen if Western Australia has a change of state government.</para><para>Let me say of the alternative Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett, whom I know well, that he is rightly making an issue in this campaign of taking decisions and not dithering about decisions being taken by government because, as minister for resources and energies in the 1990s, for example, he was the driving force behind the Dampier to Perth gas pipeline. I know that that is an example of the kind of focus that he will be able to bring to the government of that wonderful state if he is elected Premier on 26 February.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>74</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>74</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon His Excellency Mr Gran Persson, Prime Minister of Sweden, accompanied by Her Excellency Mrs Karin Ehnbom-Palmquist, the Swedish Ambassador.

Let me address the issue of debt. I think we are all aware that at various stages in our existence, whether as a nation, as individuals or as companies, we have debt. The question of the size of that debt and the manageability of that debt is determined by our capacity to service that debt. One of the products of the sparkling performance of the Australian economy over the last few years is that our capacity to service foreign debt has increased dramatically. One of the reasons that our capacity has increased spectacularly is the volume of government debt. Bear in mind that the foreign debt, which the Leader of the Opposition is undoubtedly alluding to, is of course largely the debt of individuals and corporations. </para></talk.start><para>The government itself has made a tremendous contribution towards reducing the government's contribution to debt. In fact, at 3.9 per cent of GDP, name me a developed country in the world that has a lower proportion to GDP of government debt than Australia. The OECD average is about 45 to 50 per cent; in the United States it is about 45 per cent; in Japan I think it is over 100 per cent; and ours is 3.9 per cent. That is due to the fact that when the government came to office and inherited a budget deficit of $10½ billion from the Leader of the Opposition, who was the outgoing finance minister, this government, despite the attempts of the Labor Party and others in the Senate to frustrate its budget reduction program, set about not only getting rid of that $10½ billion but also accumulating surpluses and paying off debt. That is one of the reasons why this country is in such a strong economic position. I warmly thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indigenous Affairs: Health</title><page.no>76</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>76</page.no><name role="metadata">Tollner, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TOLLNER</name><name.id>00AN4</name.id><electorate>Solomon</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing.

In 1998 the Commonwealth introduced a special scheme to substitute aviation fuel for normal petrol in remote Indigenous communities to help combat the problem of petrol sniffing. Because aviation fuel did not contain aromatic hydrocarbons, it was not attractive to sniffers. But as a result of environmental changes avgas has now become unleaded. It will contain aromatic hydrocarbons and therefore it is no longer an effective substitute for use in communities which are prone to petrol sniffing.</para></talk.start><para>I am very pleased to say that BP Australia has now developed a special type of unleaded fuel without any aromatic hydrocarbons, specially designed for use in remote Indigenous communities. I am pleased to say that, thanks to this, the government will continue to spend $1 million a year supplying unsniffable fuel to remote communities where petrol sniffing is a potential problem. Because of this, the government will be able to continue to work with community leaders in the fight against petrol sniffing. It is a very important fight. This has claimed 100 Indigenous lives since 1981.

I do stand by my minister and I think he has been unfairly, wrongly and quite disgracefully criticised by the opposition on this issue.</para><para>Let us get to the essence of this issue. The essence of this issue is that at no stage last year when we were talking about Abu Ghraib was there any evidence of substance—any evidence at all—that Australians had been involved in prisoner abuse. The whole exercise last year was designed, however indirectly, to create a different impression. The Leader of the Opposition knows this and those who sit on the front bench know this.

They are getting sick and tired of it.</para><para>Obviously it is impossible for the defence minister or the Prime Minister, whether you have a Labor government or a Liberal government, to know the minutiae of everything that takes place in a theatre of conflict. We have to rely on the information that is provided to us by the defence department. I think the Defence people have done their level best to provide accurate information to the Senate, accurate information to ministers and accurate information to me. There is a difference between interrogation and interview. That is clearly spelled out in the military manual. It is understood by Lieutenant Colonel James. It is understood by the military officers who gave evidence to the Senate estimates committee yesterday. It ought to be understood by the Leader of the Opposition, who is a former defence minister, and it should now be understood by the member for Barton.</para><para>This exercise we have had over the past few days has been a nitpicking attempt to damage the political reputation of the Minister for Defence.

A significant proportion of that was our coal exports, leading the way with growth in value. They grew by 24 per cent in 2004. This certainly is a remarkable performance as far as the resources sector is concerned.

A lot of that is going to be going into improvements in infrastructure across Australia in terms of getting those exports from their source out of the country to our export markets. Along with what our government is doing, particularly through programs like AusLink where we are set to invest $12½ billion over five years in Australia's road and rail infrastructure, it is all going towards developing the logistical supply chain to match the needs in the marketplace and the ability of our exports sector to deliver to those needs in the marketplace.</para><para>You might ask what the state governments across Australia are doing. What are the states doing, the people that control a lot of the export ports across Australia? We know what the Queensland state government is not doing. They are not investing in infrastructure, but they are collecting massive amounts of royalties from our resources sector. The Queensland government has forecast that it will receive around $800 million in royalties in 2004-05 from our resources exports. It is also forecast that that may even go through the billion dollar mark being collected by the Queensland government. Yet they will not invest any money back into the much needed infrastructure to accommodate the growth in the export of resources out of that state. They will not even fund a 70-kilometre rail link, worth around $100 million, to Abbott Point, which would immediately alleviate the bottleneck that currently exists at Dalrymple Bay, an issue that the Treasurer spoke about yesterday.</para><para>One of the local mayors in Queensland, the Mayor of Bowen, who wants to see this investment take place, said about the Queensland government: `It is just a matter of someone pulling their finger out and getting on with it.' We agree with him. The Queensland government should get on with investing in assets that will help our exporters get their product out, instead of living off the infrastructure that was invested by previous Queensland governments, particularly the Bjelke-Petersen government, over the last 30 years. They should stop loafing on that, join the Australian government and industry and invest in what we need to enhance our export infrastructure for the future. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>79</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>79</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister and follows his answer to the previous question from the honourable member for Barton.

The Australian military forces do not accept that and Neil James, who is the original author of the ADF interrogation manual, does not accept that either.

They have used a highly technical definition. Even on the basis of that highly technical definition there was unquestionably interrogation.</para></quote><para>That is the view of the member for Barton and he may hold that view and he is entitled to hold that view. But what I am putting in all seriousness to the opposition is that that is not the view of the Australian military. It is not the view of the head of the Defence Association. It was not the view of the head of military operations in Iraq who commissioned the circumstances under which people would participate in the Iraq Survey Group, and it was clearly not the view of the defence department when they provided advice to both the defence minister and to me last year. This all arises out of an attempt by the opposition to allege that in some way the defence minister and I and others in the government have misled the parliament and the Australian public.</para><para>We have done no such thing. At all stages in relation to this we have been absolutely candid. The people who are trying to distort the language, with great respect, are those who are speaking for the opposition, because they are refusing to accept what I do and what I believe most people who have examined it will do: that in the military context there is a clear distinction between an interview and an interrogation. It is spelt out in an Australian Army manual. So if it was meaningless and if we were just playing with words, why would it be spelt out in an Australian Army manual? </para><para>I say again: we have the head of the Defence Association, a former intelligence officer, who has said it very clearly. And I make no comments about Mr Barton—he is entitled to his view—but the reality is that when he signed the questionnaire that was sent out last year, the word he used was `interview'. He is a person who quintessentially was in a much better position to know the difference between `interrogation' and `interview' than I was, or the Leader of the Opposition or indeed anybody else, because he in fact had been commissioned as part of the Iraq Survey Group and he understood the terms of that commission and the terms of that engagement. He used the word `interview' when he answered the question last year. He did not use `interrogation'; he used `interview'. I suggest he did that because he then understood very clearly the distinction that existed between the two concepts, as Lieutenant Colonel James understands it, as Barton's commanding officer understands it and as I know the Leader of the Opposition understands it. Anybody who has studied the manual will understand the difference. There is a difference in Australian military parlance between the two concepts. And when that is understood, any suggestion that Senator Hill has misled the Australian public on this issue is completely false.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: School Standards</title><page.no>80</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>80</page.no><name role="metadata">Draper, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DRAPER</name><name.id>0L6</name.id><electorate>Makin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training.

One of the many initiatives announced by the government during the recent election campaign was that we will move to develop and establish an Australian certificate of education which could be undertaken by students across Australia as an alternative to the conventional year 12 examinations conducted in eight different jurisdictions.</para></talk.start><para>I will shortly be calling for tenders for appropriate organisations to develop the model, which would be based on four things. The first is that we can drive consistency amongst the eight different jurisdictions at the moment in terms of year 12 assessment and make sure that we have a common test across Australia. Alternatively, the Australian certificate of education could be based on a national curriculum based assessment. Thirdly, it could take the form of a student aptitude test, which is currently applied quite successfully across the United States of America. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the Australian certificate of education could be based on the template of the international baccalaureate, which is currently being undertaken by 20,000 Australian students throughout schools because, increasingly, parents and teachers and students are frustrated and looking for a nationally and internationally recognised and consistent qualification.</para><para>No sooner had I announced the detail in relation to this than the Deputy Leader of the Opposition issued a media release on 7 February this year which described this move for national consistency and the certificate of education in the following terms: absurd, meaningless, nonsense, bureaucratic nightmare—and so on it goes. So obviously at least the Labor Party is consistent in criticising anything which drives national consistency and high quality in standards. Then I thought, no, not everybody in the Labor Party could think that way. Then I recalled that, slipped among my Christmas cards on Christmas Eve, was a letter that I had received from one of the Labor MPs. This one, rather than being the typical one you get from the Labor backbench wilderness, was indeed from the front bench. </para><para>The letter read in part: `Dear Minister, I write on behalf of a certain school located in my electorate. The school is interested in offering the international baccalaureate course to interested students. Indeed the school is collaborating with two other schools on the development of an international baccalaureate pilot program. Currently, government schools in Victoria are not allowed to offer such a course. However, in order to pilot the international baccalaureate some funding would be required. I would be grateful for your indication as to whether such a program would be considered for funding under the Howard government's Investing in our Schools program.' That, as the Prime Minister knows, is the $1 billion that this government is investing to cut through constipated educational bureaucracies to support things that are desperately needed at the school level. The letter goes on: `I would also be grateful if you would consider allocating time when you are in Melbourne to meet with representatives with the schools who are interested in this new development in public education. I look forward to your reply.'</para><para>I am sure that Julia Gillard, member for Lalor, shadow minister for health and alternate Deputy Leader of the Opposition, will look forward to my reply. My reply is that I look forward to meeting those schools. And I ask the member for Lalor: why don't we jointly write to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and she can come along to the meeting too? It would be a lovely meeting, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition can actually listen to what parents are saying. They have had it up to here with inconsistent national standards and they are sick and tired of educational ideologues in education departments telling them what they know is not in the interests of their children.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>81</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>81</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

The report shows that the premiums for public liability insurance have fallen by 15 per cent in the six months to June 2004. This is very welcome news for the community. It means that community events that were at risk due to increased premiums will now be under less financial stress and, as a result, we have a better chance of these very important aspects of community life continuing to operate.</para></talk.start><para>The finding is also very welcome news for business and particularly small business who have to find the money for the public liability insurance premiums. These reductions will be very welcome by them. The report shows that professional indemnity insurance premiums have also fallen by 17 per cent in the six months to June 2004. This is after a number of increases in previous years. Whilst these lower premiums are welcome, the government realise there is more to be done, and we will have to monitor these prices over time to ensure they do not escalate. To that end, I have agreed that the ACCC continue to monitor prices and to make that information available in an annual report, and this will be done for next three years. The one major item of tort law reform that remains outstanding is the passing of the amendments to the Trade Practices Act which were stymied by the opposition in the Senate. We will be reintroducing that measure, and I call on the Labor Party to change their position to assist the government to keep downward pressure on insurance rates. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Regional Services: Program Funding</title><page.no>83</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>83</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Fraser</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services.

He would be interested to know that since 1996 there have been 530 new apprentices in training in his electorate, which is a 221 per cent increase. I urge the member to work hard to get an even better result over the years ahead. New apprenticeship centres, NACs—such as National Apprenticeship Services in Morphett Vale in his electorate—are contracted by the government to provide information and support, coordinate the relationships between apprentices and their employers and administer incentives for new apprenticeships. Over the last two years the number of new apprenticeship centres—an investment by this government in Australian apprenticeships—has increased from 300 to some 500 right around Australia. This year the government will spend more than $685 million on incentives paid directly to employers of new apprentices and on the provision of these support services. </para></talk.start><para>This support is absolutely essential. It is helping young people to get a start in traditional trades such as metal trades, motor trades, carpentry and plumbing. We have seen an 18 per cent increase in the number of those taking up those trades, which proves the success of the NACs. A recent survey which was commissioned by my department, to listen to people, found that employers and indeed their new apprentices are highly satisfied with the work done by the new apprenticeship centres. Nine out of every 10 employers surveyed indicated that they would use the same NAC again. In fact, 93.1 per cent said they would employ a new apprentice again in the future, which is exactly what the government wants to see Australian businesses doing. This is why the ongoing success of the government's many measures to deal with the growth of new apprentices in the Australian economy has grown training in Australia from a pitiful 141,000 apprentices in 1995 to around 400,000 today.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Regional Services: Program Funding</title><page.no>84</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>84</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name><name.id>UK6</name.id><electorate>Wills</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services.

Recently I announced 339 new programs which will help 4,000 young people across this country to provide support to their local communities. This government remains absolutely committed to the Work for the Dole program. In the member for Stirling's electorate one of those programs relates to the assistance provided to the local PCYC—helping the local police in that community to work with the children to provide support around the administration of the centre. It is a wonderful program that contributes right around the country—to the relief aid in the tsunami affected areas right across Indonesia. If the opposition remains opposed to the Work for the Dole program, why don't they dispense with the semantics and come out and say where they stand. If they are opposed to it they should scrap it as part of their policy. This government is committed to the program because it is part of the reason we have been able to bring unemployment levels down by half compared to when the opposition leader was the employment services minister.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Howard</name></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.</para></talk.start></interjection></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER</title><type>Questions to the Speaker</type><page.no>86</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Question Time</title><page.no>86</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>86</page.no><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name><name.id>YU5</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, during question time you required the honourable member for Griffith to rephrase a section of a question which sought to ask the government whether it was the government's position that a person who is not a member of this House, Mr Rod Barton, was lying.

We have opponents across the chamber from us who will say anything and do anything to get themselves elected. They will say anything, do anything, slander any reputation while in office to protect their political position. They will spend anything, under any set of conditions, and ignore any guidelines in order to secure certain amounts of money for their candidates to ensure they get elected.</para></talk.start><para>This government is unacquainted with the truth or any decent standard that would be expected of it by a public. It has abandoned truthfulness, it has abandoned good public policy and it has abandoned all proper processes. It rejects the advice of independent experts, it ignores criticism and it covers over any facts that do not fit its message. This government and the Prime Minister are obsessed with spin doctoring, with controlling every image and every story to suit their political interests, no matter what the cost. It does not matter to them if the cost is that hundreds of millions of dollars are diverted from urgently needed infrastructure into political slush funds. It does not matter to them if the cost is that they damage the reputation of dedicated public servants and service men and women. It does not matter to them if the cost is an ever-deepening public cynicism towards democratic institutions. If there is short-term political gain, the government will be in it.</para><para>Despite the government's obsession with secrecy, we sometimes find out things they do not want us to know. That has been happening through the Senate estimates process this week, a process that will be much diminished in value from the middle of this year when the government will assume absolute control of this parliament. We are seeing perhaps the last phase of the value of that institution in accountability terms in Australia, and we are going to be the poorer for it. When the facts do come out, they will paint a damning picture of a government that has contempt for integrity and openness and an obsession with spinning a message that always paints it in the most favourable light.</para><para>I want to address three issues that demonstrate the urgent need for this government to radically change its priorities and to start putting the interests of the Australian people above the interests of Liberal and National Party politicians. The first is the deliberate deception that this government has practised by promising to keep interest rates low while implementing policies that are increasing inflationary pressures and making an interest rate increase a serious possibility in the coming months by its actions. The second is the deliberate deception that this government practised last year in concealing the fact that Australian armed forces participated in the interrogation of Iraqi prisoners. The third is the deliberate deception that this government has practised by allocating hundreds of millions of dollars to spending programs that have been driven by one priority—political profit for politicians. </para><para>Let me deal with the first of those, on interest rates. All of us in this place were contestants at the last election or we would not be here. Day after day in that election campaign, we saw statement after statement by the government along the lines of that statement I quoted in question time. Here is another one:</para><quote><para>Well, we're certainly, first and foremost, we're offering a continuation of the low interest rates of the last eight and a half years.</para></quote><para>They slandered the Labor Party, which was the only political party that went into this election campaign with savings for its expenditure programs in order to reduce budgetary pressures on interest rates, through that campaign. They whipped up a fear campaign about it and they won the election. What do we find in the aftermath of that election? We find the Prime Minister here in this chamber with weasel words: `We didn't really say that. Oh, no, we didn't promise the Australian people that interest rates would not rise.' Let me tell him there are at least 10 million Australians out there who think he did, and a substantial number of them voted for him on that basis. But, no, he cites the weasel words. Every day in question time there is another exercise in hairsplitting. We heard a few of them affecting Defence personnel today, and all year we have heard the hairsplitting on the question of interest rates. But the Australian people do not believe the government and, when the government find themselves presiding over increased interest rates, they will know exactly who to blame.</para><para>The government understand this is about to happen to them, so off they go to find scapegoats. The unions are the scapegoats. We have the government's industrial relations legislation in operation. We have a quiet union movement in this country. What we have as well is a population that is not as skilled as it should be and that is creating the pressure, the glitches and the blockages in our economy now as companies that wish to invest in new developments find themselves without the work force that they need. It is not that they have an undisciplined work force; it is that they cannot get a skilled work force and blockages emerge from the infrastructure.</para><para>Yesterday, the Treasurer stood up in this place and discussed the coal loader in Queensland—very interesting. The statement he cited from the Queensland minister is about as old as the hills. It is the first time the Treasurer has managed to get up and discuss it in this place, but why did he discuss it? Because he has discovered what the opposition's infrastructure spokespersons and Treasury spokespersons have been talking about since the day they were appointed, and they have been joined by the OECD and by the Reserve Bank. One of the glitches in the economy at the moment is the manifest inattention by this government to the infrastructure needs of this nation that has been the hallmark of its rule, or its misrule, for the last nine years.</para><para>The government inherited an economy in which great changes had been made that drove it to be one of the exemplary economies in the growth of wealth of the last decade or so. There were bitter experiences for many of us who served in those governments as we took the hard decisions to make changes and we were, as a result, the targets of many of those who had suffered as those changes were made. But the rewards were all reaped in political terms by this government, and this government has trashed them. It has trashed those rewards as it has sought, every time an election has come round, to buy itself back into power. </para><para>As the Reserve Bank governor sits down and contemplates what he intends to do about the future, there is no question that one of the things he has at the back of his mind is the $66 billion that this government punched out of the budget surplus in one year flat to get itself re-elected. Did the government think that the $66 billion punched into the economy to rocket-fuel it would pass the attention of the Reserve Bank governor and that, after the election was over, he might not think about doing something about it? But what he does about it ought to be sheeted right home to our political opponents.</para><para>There is no need for interest rates to rise. They boast about interest rates, but our interest rates are about the highest in the industrialised world. On a comparative basis, we have an official rate of 5.2 per cent. It is around two per cent in the US and in Europe. The nearest rate to ours is the British, which is 4.75 per cent. The Japanese rate is 0.1 per cent. And we are talking about the possibility of a 50 basis point rise in those circumstances. Where is our international competitiveness here? What is going to happen to Australian businesses as a result of that? And it can all be sheeted back to that $66 billion punch and the other matters that I have been referring to that John Howard put out for his re-election campaign.</para><para>The icing on the cake of that $66 billion had to be that extraordinary campaign launch of his. I have seen a few rippers in my time, and the odd Labor Party leader has been responsible for one or two of them, but I have never seen money spent in a policy speech at the rate of $200 million a minute. That absolutely took the prize, that absolutely took the cake; and that was our political opponents.</para><para>Truth in government goes elsewhere as well. It can go to national security areas and to the honour with which civil servants are dealt. The Prime Minister attacked us in question time today as though we have been attacking Defence personnel. He got up and said, `What the Labor Party are trying to prove is that Australian Defence personnel were involved in torture at Abu Ghraib.' No, that is not it. We are on the same wavelength as Mr Barton—the person who has blown the whistle on the government—an honourable public servant. We are trying to prove that the Australian people were deceived and this parliament was deceived when the government said it knew nothing about it and was not informed of these things until they became public matters.</para><para>Why would we want to know if the government knew something about it beforehand? The reason is that we take our allied duties seriously. Anyone can see, and it certainly was obviously the case after this issue broke out, that this would hand our enemies an unsurpassed propaganda victory and, if there were an opportunity to give a sensible warning to our ally that this sort of behaviour would be 100 per cent counterproductive to the objectives we seek in our life-and-death struggle with militant, fundamentalist terror, we would want at least a performance by the government in that regard.</para><para>The government seeks always to evade responsibility. When you take upon yourself the sort of struggle that is now being engaged in in Iraq, however mistaken that may be, you take upon yourself every single element of it. You must know the detail of what is going on with all armed service personnel in the area. And if a fella has come back and is seriously concerned enough to get the secretary of his department to write to the American ambassador here to warn him that this is going on—to get them back in the United States to stop things happening in Abu Ghraib—why in God's name didn't you do something about it? Instead of running around trying to evade responsibility and cover your backsides, why don't you just take a bit of responsibility for the jobs that you have in hand and deal with the problems? </para><para>A question was asked by the honourable member for Griffith about the difference between interrogation and interviewing. If a chap who is manacled thinks an interrogation is being conducted when the bloke standing behind the fellow in front of him has a gun, does he think he is having a little chat—`This is just a small conversation; a chin wag about the state of the world'? Fair dinkum, you must really think that we have a very foolish Australian public to wander around in this place hairsplitting on a subject like that. It is very important that you are hairsplitting. Why do you hairsplit on that? Is it to arrive at the truth of what we were told about Abu Ghraib and to have a bit of analysis about how we might have done a bit better in this? Is that the reason? No; because if we accept that `interview' means `interrogate' then the Prime Minister has lied to parliament. If he has lied to parliament, even under all the conventions the government has trampled on, the normal consequence is that you resign. He does not want that. He does not want Senator Hill to have to resign, he does not want to have to resign himself, and so words are given different meanings and decent people have their reputations trampled upon. That is what has happened in this case.</para><para>Finally, we get the performance. I have got to get myself onto the tactics committee of the other side and pinch a few of the questions—like the one that was asked today of the Deputy Prime Minister. If anything ever exposed what they were on about with these regional rorts, that was an absolute ripper. The only person who did not feature in the announcements in Brand was the member for Brand. Everybody else had a chop. Every Liberal Party and National Party minister had his fingerprints on it. They all had a chop, but the honourable member for Brand missed out. The simple fact of the matter is this: you have used $400 million of taxpayers' funds to undermine your political opponents. In most countries, that is described as corruption. Unfortunately, the consequence of this is that it has stripped your capacity to deal with the infrastructure of this nation on a proper basis. That is what it has done. We do have problems like that coal loader in Queensland and we do have problems with the port-rail interface. Why? Because the Commonwealth has put all the funds for those purposes into the campaign treasuries of the National Party and the Liberal Party, looting royally, and incompetently, I might say, as we have revealed in case after case in this place, and then has misled the Australian people about what it is up to. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

His real complaint is that this government won and that opposition lost. His real complaint is that for the fourth time members opposite have failed to secure the trust of the Australian people. So, rather than accepting the truth that members opposite simply are not up to it and that the last four times members opposite simply have not put an adequate case to the Australian people for their election, rather than accept that simple, democratic truth, he has to pretend that somehow `they was robbed'. `We was robbed' is the essential claim that the Leader of the Opposition is making now. He made it in 1998; he made it in 1996. It is this constant, tired refrain: `We was robbed.'

People are no longer in any doubt about what the Labor Party stands for and we will be able to build on that.</para></quote><para>These people who claim that there is nothing more important than being open and honest are the same people who distributed this document. It is a document distributed by the secretariat of the Australian Labor Party to all frontbenchers and spokesmen on election night. Plainly, it is a tissue of lies, an absolute fabrication from start to finish. The Labor Party were so united that their leader was dumped humiliatingly, acrimoniously and unprecedentedly just a couple of months after the election campaign.</para><para>The fact of the matter is that these people opposite, huffing and puffing hysterically about the alleged lies and deceit of this government, do not come to this debate with clean hands. We have seen from the Leader of the Opposition over the last couple of weeks a bad case of political schizophrenia because obviously there are two Kims. There is Brand Kim, who is desperately seeking, desperately demanding, Regional Partnerships grants, desperately trying to claim the credit for $1.1 million worth of Regional Partnerships grants in his electorate, writing to the Deputy Prime Minister demanding that the government provide Regional Partnerships grants to his electorate, distributing to his electorate newsletters that try to claim credit for the award of Regional Partnerships grants in his electorate, and then there is Canberra Kim, who tries to suggest that all of this is some kind of giant boondoggle, that this is some kind of giant election slush fund. You cannot have it both ways: it is impossible to be in favour of Regional Partnerships grants in your electorate and opposed to Regional Partnerships grants in this parliament. The Leader of the Opposition stands exposed yet again, as he has stood so many times in this parliament, as a hypocrite, as a two-timer, as someone who says one thing in the electorate and another thing in this parliament. The Australian people know him, they have rejected him and they are not going to let him get away with this kind of treatment of the parliament and the people for that much longer. </para><para>The lie to the claims from members opposite was given today in a most interesting opinion piece on the op-ed page of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review. </inline>One of the more credible, one of the more honourable and one of the more honest members of the Australian Labor Party is the member for Melbourne—a member of this parliament who, if the Leader of the Opposition himself had more strength and more integrity, would be on the frontbench of the Australian Labor Party. He is misguided in many respects, but he is honest and he is honourable. He tells the truth: he says what he means and means what he says. What did the member for Melbourne say today in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> of this whole tedious campaign that has been run by the Leader of the Opposition over the past fortnight? I quote:</para><quote><para>Sadly, neither I nor the Labor Party have been entirely pure in these matters.

As opposition transport spokesman, I promised to fund a study into pilot training at Launceston Airport and a rail research institute in Adelaide.</para></quote><para>He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>It's about time we got serious about the misuse of money ...</para></quote><para>He has given the lie to the entire Labor Party campaign of the last fortnight—guilty as charged, he says of the Australian Labor Party. This is not a guilty government; this is a guilty opposition. Indeed, if there is any guilt in this, and I do not believe that there is, it is a guilty parliament.

There is no evidence that anyone on the frontbench of this government has ever answered questions other than honestly on the basis of the best knowledge available to that minister at that time. As the Prime Minister said so well in this chamber today, there is no evidence that Senator Hill has done anything other than patiently and comprehensively answer questions put to him on the basis of the best advice that he had at the time.</para><para>This is an opposition which has become somewhat hysterical. What is behind all the activities of the last few days? It is not concern for the people of Iraq. It is not concern for Cornelia Rau. It is not concern for the dental health of the people of New South Wales. All that matters to them is trying to prove that the Prime Minister is an incompetent liar. I think they need to get over their fixation with Prime Minister Howard. I think they need to have a long, hard look at themselves. In particular, the Leader of the Opposition needs to have a long, hard look at himself and try to prove that he is different from the person that the Australian people do know well and have rejected so often. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>95</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name><name.id>UK6</name.id><electorate>Wills</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to complement the Leader of the Opposition's contribution to this debate by talking about the need for us to get honesty from this government with the Australian people in relation to Regional Partnerships, which has degenerated into an all-singing, all-dancing $400 million Howard government slush fund.

The Beaudesert railway is now left with just a steam engine, which is itself security for an outstanding debt to the Queensland government. What a monument to this government's financial mismanagement—a sorry tale of government ineptitude and incompetence, of throwing good taxpayers' money after bad. We had the Prime Minister in here yesterday telling the House he made an `on-balance judgment' to provide a further $660,000 of taxpayers' money to Beaudesert Rail. Never mind that this made a complete joke of the Regional Partnerships guidelines about the need for financial viability, never mind that the department believed it was not financially viable, never mind that the provisional liquidator did not believe it was financially viable, never mind its failure to properly acquit the $5 million Centenary of Federation funds: the Prime Minister made an `on-balance judgment' to put another $660,000 of taxpayers' money into this lemon.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Why did he do it? He did it to save the Liberal member for Forde from embarrassment in the lead-up to an election. You see, she had her name all over the original $5 million Centenary of Federation grant to get the Beaudesert Rail project up and going. When she heard that this project was about to go off the rails and the $5 million was going to be wasted, she was no doubt mortified. She is the person who persuaded the Prime Minister to first offer a $400,000 loan and later turn it into a $660,000 grant—$660,000 to save the face of the member for Forde. Menelaus thought Helen of Troy's face worthy of the launch of a thousand ships. The Prime Minister thought the member for Forde's face worthy of $660,000 of taxpayers' money!</para><para>The 13 June 2003 report of the provisional liquidator makes this absolutely clear. He says that, after his appointment, he was able to conclude that Beaudesert Rail could not pay its creditors merely from trading. He says that he contacted Mrs Kay Elson, the federal member for Forde, to discuss the possibility of receiving further funds. He says: `In a discussion with Ms Elson and Mr Ron Munn, the Mayor of Beaudesert, it was clearly put to me that by keeping the train trading, albeit at a loss, it would significantly enhance the prospects of receiving federal government funding.' The provisional liquidator then became caught between the concerns of creditors, on the one hand—he says that `the committee of creditors were understandably concerned that we were trading at a loss'; they were trading while insolvent—and, on the other hand, the urgings of the member for Forde to keep the train going.</para><para>The provisional liquidator decided to bring things to a head. He said that, unless something concrete was received by 5 June 2003, Beaudesert Rail should cease business and market its assets for sale. The next day, he said, `It was made clear to me by Mr Munn and Ms Elson that approval of government funding was a matter of days away and that this funding was to save Beaudesert Rail and to close down would make it more difficult to obtain the funding, if not impossible.' On Friday, 6 June, he said, `I received a letter from Ms Elson advising that government funding was imminent and I made the decision to trade the business over the weekend to see if this was the case.' Honourable members, I am sure, can feel the air of crisis here. On 12 June 2003, the provisional liquidator received a letter from the Prime Minister making a conditional offer of a $400,000 loan. </para><para>It is absolutely clear from the provisional liquidator's report that the actions of the member for Forde and the Prime Minister compromised the government and, therefore, Australian taxpayers in this matter. The reason Beaudesert Rail kept running during this period, its losses increasing with each passing week, was because the member for Forde and the Prime Minister had made representations to the provisional liquidator. Just imagine if, after all that, the government had said, `We've examined your project, and we think it's a dog, and we're not going to give it any more money,' the creditors would have been outraged, and with good reason. So we come to the end of the line for $5.7 million of taxpayers' money. Where the Prime Minister should have been interrogating the member for Forde over that money, it looks like he did not even bother to interview her.</para><para>Where there is a rort, you just feel it in your bones, you know the National Party is going to be in there somewhere—and so it is here. The Beaudesert Rail project had been spearheaded by Joy Drescher, a former National Party candidate for state parliament, who was elected mayor of Beaudesert earlier this year. Yesterday the member for Grayndler urged the Prime Minister to carpe diem—to seize the day—on the issue of climate change. But the National Party has its own motto. It is not carpe diem; it is carpe prosciutto—Latin for `seize the pork'. The member for Hotham, who fancies himself as a bit of a Latin scholar, thinks it should be carpe porchetta—but perhaps he is just advertising a restaurant chain. The National Party is so reliable in this that I have developed my own law of physics, which says: `Where there's a coalition trough, there's a National Party snout.' Now I know it is not as elegant or as important as Einstein's law of relativity or Newton's law of gravity, but it holds good for the overwhelming majority of Howard government programs.</para><para>And so it is that we heard today that it is not just the National Party mayor of Beaudesert but the National Party mayor of Tweed Heads, south of the border, Mr Warren Polglase, who recommended a $273,000 Dairy Assistance Program grant to Seawind, a South Tweed seafood company which has now gone bust. Mr Polglase is a very active man. He is the mayor of Tweed Shire Council, the local National Party Electorate Council chair and a member of the Northern Rivers Area Consultative Committee. He managed to get himself appointed as an executive officer or a project officer to administer the Dairy Assistance Program.</para><para>We understand that this position was advertised but that no interviews—certainly no interrogations—for the position were ever held. Warren Polglase just got the job. Minister Anderson needs to inform the parliament and the Australian people just what selection process Mr Polglase went through before he was given this position. Mr Polglase has all the hallmarks of the Queensland National Party under Joh Bjelke-Petersen. If you read what has been happening in the New South Wales inquiry, you will discover that he is something of a colourful National Party identity. But, as the executive officer for the Dairy Assistance Program, he managed to recommend $88,000 in Dairy Regional Assistance grant money to prominent National Party supporters to add farm-stay accommodation to their tea tree farm and to recommend $273,000 of taxpayers' money to Seawind, a South Tweed seafood company that has subsequently gone bust. </para><para>My time is coming to a close but, as there was a bit of enthusiasm for the nursery rhyme last week, I will conclude with a verse:</para><quote><para>The Ballad of Beaudesert Rail</para><para>They say it comes out on the nights of full moon</para><para>The ghost train of Beaudesert from its rusting cocoon</para><para>It once used to run amid whoops amid hollers</para><para>Till it chewed up 5 million of taxpayers' dollars</para><para>The Deputy PM put it back on the track</para><para>With six hundred grand more that went straight up the stack</para><para>So now it sits idle a monument stored</para><para>And nobody comes when they shout “All aboard”</para><para>And they talk about rorts and they talk about fraud</para><para>Of a train with one passenger, the Member here for Forde</para><para>And it's just a classic case of throwing good money after bad</para><para>And how voters they were conned, and taxpayers they were had.</para><para>But there's still hope for it yet tho much ill of it we speak</para><para>Build a rail line to Dobell?

As a poet he has no chance at all. This matter of public importance, which says, `The need for the government to be open and honest with the Australian people,' is a joke—the ALP talking about honesty and integrity in government! They should be the last ones to talk about it. In fact, we all remember the lead-up to the 1993 election, when the tax cuts were going to become `l-a-w law'. There were going to be no tax increases at all. You could rest on it—Paul Keating went out and told the Australian public: `You can trust this Labor government. You can rely on it. We will deliver on our promises. There will be no tax increases.' Of course, once the election— <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></talk.start><para>It is very clear that the opposition do not want to hear the truth about what they promised in 1993 in terms of l-a-w law. Labor promised there were going to be tax cuts and what happened? They did not happen at all. Then, of course, when they went to the 1996 election the current Leader of the Opposition, the then minister for finance, told us that there was a surplus of $10.1 billion. He said that frequently around the country. What was the reality of it? In fact, a week after this government came to office we found it was a $10.3 billion deficit. So much for honesty. It was only a $20 billion lie—not bad—and it was the Leader of the Opposition who got up and said it.</para><para>Of course, we remember that wonderful institution Centenary House. It is just a prime example of honesty and integrity in government. It is like a symbol. If you went into the old East Block, there would be a symbol of the working man there to show what they are about. I think in future there will be tours to Centenary House to show people: this is what the Labor Party in office believed was appropriate integrity, honesty and openness for the Australian people. It was called a $43 billion rort. And they are the ones who are lecturing us on honesty.</para><para>Regarding the regional grants that we are now talking about, there were some 800 applications from coalition held seats and 200 from Labor held seats. They were too busy having their lattes and chardonnays to actually help people fill in their applications. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> Again the Labor Party do not want to hear the truth. The Labor Party did not assist their communities to apply for regional grants. The fact is that the percentage of applications that were approved for Labor seats and the percentage approved for coalition seats was exactly the same. There was clearly no bias; it was independently audited three times by KPMG. There were three reviews which made no findings of impropriety. </para><para>By contrast, we remember old Ros Kelly, the then member for Canberra. Did she know how to rort. She was the master of rort with the old whiteboard: `We'll have five for the Labor Party, one for the coalition, 10 for the Labor Party.' They took the whiteboard to great excellence but she did not survive. That was the member for Canberra who taught us all about what she thought was truth and honesty in government. It shows quite clearly that they have no understanding of what truth and honesty are.</para><para>In the last election they made $40 billion of promises and they said that PricewaterhouseCoopers was going to do a total audit of the costings and they indicated that they were properly funded. PricewaterhouseCoopers had to put out a statement saying that that was wrong, that all that they were required to do was to add up the amount. There was no verification of whether the funding was appropriate or the claims they made as to where the funding was. A lot of it was purely bogus money all the way through. They failed to submit their policies to Treasury and Finance before the deadline set by the department. They did not put their whole tax policy before the deadline or their child-care policy, their schools policy or their defence policy. Labor even refused to submit Medicare Gold.</para><para>In the debate today we have the Leader of the Opposition, a former finance minister, talking about interest rates. He accused this government in outrageous terms. He talked about the increases in interest rates that are happening, and of course there has been no announcement by the Reserve Bank at all about interest rate increases. We remember what the interest rates were under the other side—17 per cent. For small business it went up to 21 per cent. Under this government the amount is five to 6½ per cent. The Leader of the Opposition wants to indicate his economic credentials, but it is clear he knows nothing about interest rates.</para><para>On the issues of credibility, honesty and reliability, it is this side of the House that sets the example. The Charter of Budget Honesty that we provided set out the parameters. It showed the lies, the fraud, the dishonesty, the rorting of the previous government. We have shown what integrity in government is really about. The mob opposite are just producing a total sham. It is time they decided to get with the program and decide that honesty in government is the way to go. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

During the election there was another commitment made, a commitment to a football stadium, but it was made by the opposition. The stadium we are talking about used to be called Marathon Stadium; it is now called Energy Australia Stadium. The state government, which own this facility and are responsible for it, have already put in some $32 million. They seem to demand that the federal government also contribute $32 million towards their facility. I am not against providing money for a football stadium but, as I said to my constituents during the election—and I said it before and I said it during and I say it after the election—I put the issues and interests of my electorate first, second, third and last.</para></talk.start><para>The football stadium is not in my electorate. In fact it is not a responsibility of this government. On the Central Coast the Graham Park Stadium that was built at Gosford was built for around $23 million in total. I have to ask: why is it that only half a stadium can be built for $32 million and why the cost blow-out to $60 million? Should the board of the International Sports Centre Trust achieve the funding from the state government then I wish them well, because there is no doubt that the area does deserve a world-class football stadium. But it should be funded by those that own the stadium.</para><para>The issues that are important to my electorate are roads, health and education. That is what we committed to; that is what we were determined to deliver to the people of Paterson. I spoke before about road funding and I spoke about the money that had been offered to the councils of Port Stephens, Dungog and Great Lakes. We have put $10 million on the table which is to be matched by the state government with an additional $10 million. The funding is broken up into three groupings. Two million dollars is for Great Lakes Shire. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>This will probably go down as the greatest hour of contribution from the member for Shortland: the greatest contribution she can make is to draw the chair's attention to the state of the House. On that side of the House we have an impotent member of parliament who can deliver nothing to her electorate. That is the same member who under the Regional Solutions program condemned this government for providing no packages to her electorate. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know why no packages were delivered to her electorate? It was because she had not even bothered to work with her community to put in any applications. That is the sort of member that she is. She is impotent and should not be in this place. If it were not for the fact that she had such a safe seat she would not be here. She is a disgrace as a member. She cannot even convince her colleagues in the New South Wales government to deliver projects in the Hunter. </para><para>Road funding suffers in the Hunter under the Carr state Labor government, of which she was a member prior to coming to this place—and she has done nothing since to help to deliver projects. The football stadium that I spoke about is the responsibility of the Carr Labor government and, again, she has done nothing to represent her constituents in obtaining money from the state Labor government. She sits there, whines, whinges and delivers nothing on behalf of her constituents in the seat of Shortland. It is absolutely disgraceful. As I said, perhaps the best contribution she has made in this place is bringing on three quorums because she is bored and ineffective as a member of parliament.</para><para>I am proud of the road funding that I deliver to my electorate.

I stand up proudly for the Hunter Valley and I deliver things. I try to represent my constituents with honour. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have just seen two efforts from two members of the Hunter that are disgraceful in terms of allowing free speech and allowing me to represent my constituents in this place. I was speaking about road funding, what we have delivered and what we have promised, but I can bet that the state Labor government will not match our $10 million that we are putting into this community.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Why did we have to do that? We had to do it because we put $20 million into the Bucketts Way, which the member for Hunter, who has just left the chamber under your instructions, opposed each and every step of the way. The state government refused to contribute to their road, the Bucketts Way. But work is carrying on and the difference that it is making is that there has been a reduction in fatalities on the Bucketts Way. That is the best reason to invest in roads: to save people's lives, to make them safer and to improve the economic conditions of every person that travels on them. The $10 million that we are offering to the local councils includes $2 million for the Lakes Way—a road that is in very poor state. But the state government seems to wash its hands of that one, which is a major road for tourism through Bulahdelah to Pacific Palms through the Forster-Tuncurry area. </para><para>But do we hear a word from the state Labor government? Not a word. We are putting $2 million into Port Stephens Council for the road between Raymond Terrace and Glen Oak. In addition, $6 million will go to the Dungog Council for the road from Glen Oak up through to Dungog. This is an area that was heavily affected by the decision of the former Prime Minister to shut down the timber industry. That was the first nail in the coffin for the township of Dungog. The second was when, in the New South Wales parliament, the member for Shortland's friend Bob Carr moved for dairy deregulation. That was the second thing that hurt and hit my township.</para><para>I do not sit back; I get on the front foot and drive for economic improvement in my area. I want to create jobs in my area, so I lobbied and lobbied and have been able to deliver $10 million worth of road funding. The question was put to me when the members for Shortland and Hunter stood up proudly and said, `We want to fund a football stadium.' The Labor federal government was going to throw $30 million into a football stadium. I said I would rather put $10 million into roads because that will help save lives; that will improve the economic conditions of those towns that those roads serve. That is money well spent and well invested in our community, and I am determined to deliver on it.</para><para>But there is a hitch. Because the member for Shortland's friend Bob Carr would not commit money to match it on the Bucketts Way, we had to make it a condition of approval. What have they said so far? The recently ousted minister for roads, Carl Scully, said, `I'm not going to fund it.' Now we have a new Minister for Roads in New South Wales, Michael Costa. He is also the minister for the Hunter. Let us hope he has a different attitude towards saving people's lives and improving roads and economic conditions in regional and rural areas. After all, he is not only the roads minister, he is the minister for the Hunter. Guess what they have just done—and this is why I doubt we are going to get anything. The Newcastle Knights just made him their patron. So his focus will be on a football stadium not on the fatalities. He will not be interested in saving lives in my electorate.</para><para>The other issue I have is that the state government in New South Wales have absolutely no hesitation in spending another $1 billion on a tunnel under Sydney to improve traffic flow. It does not save any lives; it just improves traffic flow. Can you imagine what a billion dollars of road funding from the New South Wales government would do in rural and regional areas? It would go a long way towards fixing and finishing off the road between Sydney and Brisbane—the Pacific Highway.

The attitude from the opposition has been disgraceful, but they will never stop me standing up for the people that I represent, pushing for the issues that are important to them and making sure that I give them the best possible representation I can in this place.

The first issue relates to the Australian Broadcasting Authority and its failure to grant a radio licence for Sydney frequency 1386AM. I foreshadow that the second issue I will raise, if I do not get time to do so today, concerns the government's failure to protect free-to-air television viewers from a loophole in the antisiphoning regime.</para></talk.start><para>There is a long history attached to the ABA's failure to grant a radio licence for Sydney frequency 1386AM. I am advised that on 25 May 2001 the ABA formed a preliminary view that an additional wide coverage community radio service should be made available in Sydney and called for public comment as to the suitable use of 1386AM for community radio. I am advised that on 27 July 2001 the ABA received several submissions, including one from Sydney Christian Broadcasters Ltd, also known as Rhema Sydney, on behalf of Sydney's estimated 900,000 churchgoing Christians. I am also advised that on 27 December 2001 the ABA received a revised draft variation to the Sydney radio licence area plan, proposing alternative sites for the community radio station. After receiving further submissions, the ABA continued to announce its support for a community radio station.</para><para>In March 2002 the ABA decided to make 1386AM available as a community broadcasting service instead of a narrowcasting service. On 15 July 2002 the ABA invited new applications for the Sydney-wide community radio licence transmitting on the 1386AM band. Again, fresh submissions were called for. On 26 March 2003 the ABA decided not to allocate radio licence 1386AM. In each case, Radio Rhema made submissions. In the final decision, the ABA was concerned about the location of a transmission station in the Sydney suburb of Homebush in my electorate of Lowe, allegedly because of concerns about proximity to new homes. On this basis, a decision was deferred for 12 months.</para><para>I am further advised that, in March 2003, eight applicants bid for the allocation of a Sydney community radio operator licence on frequency 1386 megahertz on the amplitude modulation, or AM, band. At that time, the ABA rejected all eight licence applicants. This rejection is of itself not unusual, but the failure of the ABA to grant a temporary licence was unusual. Incredibly, on 22 April 2004 the ABA called for yet another round of public comment. To this very day, there has still been no decision by the ABA to grant this radio licence.</para><para>By far the main contender in the application process is Rhema Sydney. The narrowing of bids to two main contenders follows other bidders dropping out. Put simply, Rhema Sydney has demonstrated overwhelming public interest. Rhema Sydney's application greatly outweighed all other applications in responses from the general public of Sydney, who strongly called for Rhema Sydney to be granted the 1386AM licence. In its submission, Rhema Sydney notes that it has in excess of 4,000 members and over 750 letters in support representing close to 460,000 individuals in the greater Sydney region. </para><para>I am advised that an estimated 2.4 million Sydney residents identify themselves as Christian—that is, some 66 per cent of the Sydney metropolitan population. I am advised that an estimated 1.8 million Sydney residents attend church services at least at Easter or Christmas. Thus it may be said there are in Sydney nearly two million Christians who adhere to the main feast days on the Christian calendar. In addition, an estimated 900,000 people in Sydney are reported to attend Christian church services at least monthly.</para><para>Compounding the fact that there is a high percentage of Christians in the Sydney metropolitan area, a large number of the population are social service recipients who rely on broadcast information. Such broadcast services include the necessity for talkback radio and other media access. The average percentage of Christians in any one Sydney electorate is between 25 and 30 per cent. In my electorate of Lowe, the percentage of practising Christians reaches nearly 50 per cent. Finally, there are an estimated 2,000 Christian places of worship throughout Sydney.</para><para>In every sense, the Christian voice is frustrated in its ability to be heard. With reference to 2CBA FM, it is often claimed that Sydney already has one Christian radio station. With respect, this is a false argument. 2CBA FM does a wonderful job. However, its target audience and scope is much narrower than the proposed broadcasting service's community of interest. Firstly, it is intended that Rhema Sydney will service the broader Sydney Christian community, who have long suffered without a voice, to broadcast their services and address their mass-market needs. Secondly, Rhema Sydney intends to cater for the larger, different and cross-denominational Christian markets, each of which have demonstrably different needs and interests within the greater Sydney metropolitan area. Programming will include talkback, alternative journalists' views on news and other public affairs items, and it will give the large Christian community a voice on the public airwaves. Moreover, Rhema Sydney intends to be a voice for people with disabilities, older Australians, youth and those marginalised in our society.</para><para>I call on the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to intervene in this matter and accept the overwhelming support of the Sydney community and the demonstrable public interest in the granting of a temporary licence to Rhema Sydney on radio frequency 1386AM. The ABA has prevaricated, obfuscated and simply refused to admit that the Rhema proposal shines above any of the other bidders. The Rhema application easily outweighs the other contenders in size, public support and sheer quality.</para><para>The facts are undeniable: there is a great unmet need for Christian radio broadcasting in the Sydney metropolitan area. There is, in my opinion, utterly no justification whatsoever for refusing to grant Rhema Sydney a radio licence or at least a temporary licence. The necessity for the ABA to call for public submissions four times is absurd. The information gathered and the submissions received—many of them from members of this House—all point to the needs of the supporters of clearly the largest and most comprehensive submission for a licence for a radio station. I urge the minister to recognise the cross-party support, including support from members of her own coalition colleagues, in granting Rhema Sydney this transmission licence. </para><para>Mr Speaker, on another matter, you would be aware of my longstanding campaign to protect the public interest and Australia's democracy by exposing the Howard government's pandering to the interests of the major media proprietors in tearing down Australia's cross-media laws. Another appalling example of the Howard government's determination to serve the interests of the major media proprietors, ahead of the interests of the Australian people, is the cynical way the government has managed the broadcasting services antisiphoning list. The antisiphoning list is supposed to protect Australian households who do not have access to pay television from being denied important sporting events on free-to-air television. The antisiphoning list is designed to protect free-to-air television viewers by guaranteeing the rights of free-to-air television channels—that is, Nine, Seven, Ten, the ABC and SBS—to buy the broadcast rights to sporting events listed on the antisiphoning list. Some examples of events on the antisiphoning list, which is current until December 2010, include the Olympic Games, the Melbourne Cup, Australian rugby union and cricket test matches, the 2006 FIFA World Cup and rugby league and Australian rules football matches.</para><para>It is important to understand that the antisiphoning list does not guarantee that an event will be on free-to-air television. If the free-to-air broadcasters decline to purchase rights to listed events, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts may delist such events, allowing pay television providers to acquire the rights to televise the event. Moreover, of far greater importance, especially to the millions of Australians who have always enjoyed the coverage of nationally significant sporting events on free-to-air television, is the loophole in the antisiphoning laws. This loophole has, very sadly, all but ensured that for the first time in more than 33 years Australia's Ashes test cricket series in England from July to September 2005 will not be broadcast on free-to-air television, despite the fact that it is on the antisiphoning list. How has this happened? Free-to-air broadcasters blame a loophole in the antisiphoning laws. Remember that the antisiphoning regime was established to ensure important sporting events, such as the Ashes cricket, would not become exclusive to pay-TV licensees, such as Foxtel.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>105</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Mr Peter Harris, a leading member of the scouting community in the ACT, came up with the original concept of a cuboree some years ago, and this most recent event was the seventh cuboree to be held. They are held every three years and we have witnessed growing participation and popularity each time. In fact, other states and territories are now holding or developing similar cuborees within their own jurisdictions.</para></talk.start><para>I had the pleasure of visiting the camp site during this three- to four-day event in the middle of January. The cuboree was held at the Kangaroo Flat camping ground here in Canberra—an area that was very savagely affected by the 18 January 2003 fires which occurred in the ACT. It is an absolute testament to the dedication and determination of everyone involved in the scouting movement in Canberra, under the leadership of the Chief Commissioner of Scouts ACT, Neville Tomkins, that they could even imagine going ahead and holding a cuboree of this size on this site, given the damage that was incurred just over two years ago. </para><para>The theme for this year's cuboree was `Dream on' with activities around the camp site encouraging the youngsters to establish their dreams, learn to have the courage to strive for them and learn how to encourage others in their team to dare to dream with them. A time capsule from the 1996 cuboree, containing the hopes and the dreams of cubs at that particular function, was dug up by some who were there at that time.</para><para>Altogether 1,150 people, including more than 800 cubs, plus leaders and volunteers, attended this cuboree. That is a pretty large number of folk under tents for three to four days in the heat of January in Canberra. If any member is planning a similarly large event, I can assure them that I have a recipe available from the people who ran this cuboree, which will produce spaghetti bolognaise for 1,150 people. The recipe starts with 195 kilograms of mince and 140 kilograms of spaghetti. That gives you an idea of the enormous size of this particular event.</para><para>When I visited, with other guests for the afternoon, I was absolutely moved by the enthusiasm of the leaders and the volunteers in ensuring that these young people from the ACT, New South Wales and some areas of South Australia, who came to participate in this three-yearly event, had the best time and learnt a great deal. There was a massive camaraderie and it was all a testament to the people who organised it.</para><para>On a second issue, I would like to make brief reference to the recent very tragic fires in South Australia. As the member for Canberra, I can assure the House and the member for Grey, Mr Wakelin, of my concern and compassion on behalf of the community here towards the community in South Australia and the Eyre Peninsula. The events there brought back bad memories for us and we know the sort of trauma that they were facing during those tragic fires in South Australia.</para><para>I have to commend the ACT government. They very quickly got in touch with the authorities in South Australia and offered ACT SES assistance. A public servant, Di Butcher, who achieved a great deal in successfully establishing and running the ACT Bushfire Recovery Centre, has, I believe, visited South Australia—at their wish—on several occasions to assist them to set up a similar sort of arrangement in that area of South Australia. We learnt a great deal through the necessities of the events surrounding the fires here in January 2003 and we were only too happy to offer whatever support, compassion and sympathy we could.</para><para>The residents of Duffy—part of my constituency that was very severely hit by the fires of 2003—immediately started fundraising and I believe they have already raised over $2,000, and that amount is increasing. The Duffy residents suffered the sort of damage that epitomised what was unfortunately felt here in Canberra and they immediately wanted to step in and offer some sort of support to those people on the Eyre Peninsula—and they are doing so, along with other people in my constituency. I take the opportunity to offer, on behalf of my constituents, our sympathies to those people who were so severely and tragically affected on the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, and our ongoing support in any way that we can offer, given our experience. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Mrs Melinda Poor</title><page.no>107</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>107</page.no><name role="metadata">Keenan, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KEENAN</name><name.id>E0J</name.id><electorate>Stirling</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Yesterday in this House the member for Wills made reference to one of my constituents, Mrs Melinda Poor, who is also the Liberal candidate for the state seat of Balcatta in the upcoming election. The member for Wills recounted the events that occurred when Mrs Poor called into a radio station where the former member for Stirling and I were having a live debate. He believes her call caused a great deal of electoral grief for the Labor member for Stirling.</para></talk.start><para>I might remind the House of what actually transpired. The debate between the former member and me occurred not long after the Labor Party released their new family tax package. Astonishingly, this package would have disadvantaged struggling families in many areas of my electorate and around Australia. Mrs Poor called ABC radio to express her concern that her husband and three children would be roughly $500 worse off under the Labor Party's policy. At that time she was pregnant with her fourth child and when the baby was born she would have become roughly $1,000 worse off under Labor's policy. So Mrs Poor, quite rightly, called her local member and asked her what she thought of local families being disadvantaged in this way.</para><para>The former member for Stirling replied that the Labor Party would need to look at changing the package. At the time, this rightly caused a media storm as the opposition struggled to explain why they would adopt such a punitive tax regime. Following the former member for Stirling's comments, the Labor Party gagged her and she was not allowed to talk to the media for rest of the campaign. My campaign team and I really had a laugh when the Labor Party would not even let her finish a prearranged commitment to do a 90-second pre-recorded interview about her hobbies.</para><para>I would suggest to the member for Wills that it was not one of my constituents calling talkback radio to truthfully express her concern about how her family was going to suffer under a Labor government that caused the former member for Stirling electoral grief. It was the person who dreamed up Labor's failed electoral platform plus the actions of the former member that were to blame. The people of Stirling were not prepared to wear a party that attacked the living standards of those described by one Perth reporter as `world-class battlers'.</para><para>As to the concerns expressed that Mrs Poor and I had met before she called the radio, it is well known that we did. What Mrs Poor actually said later in the same article quoted by the member for Wills is that we did not know each other well. Fortunately, though, since that time I have come to know Mrs Poor because I have been campaigning with her as she is the Liberal candidate for Balcatta. I have spent time campaigning and listening to the concerns that the people of Stirling have about the Gallop state Labor government. I can tell the member for Wills that the people of the state electorate of Balcatta are sick of the indecision, the committees, the inquiries, the scoping studies, the reports and the total inability of the state Labor government to make decisions and to get on with the job of governing the great state of Western Australia. They are crying out to be represented by real people from their own communities who understand their needs and aspirations—exactly the sort of candidate represented by Mrs Poor. So I predict that, just as the people of Stirling rejected federal Labor, the people of WA will reject state Labor on 26 February and vote for Colin Barnett and his Liberal team to give us decisions, not more delays. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>China: Mine Safety</title><page.no>108</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>108</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this evening to talk on the issue of mine safety in China. At a time when Australia's relationship with China is becoming increasingly important to our economic future, I address the House this evening on a subject that must not be ignored in the context of negotiating a bilateral trade agreement, future investment flows and the production and manufacture of our traded resources, goods and services. That subject is, of course, human rights and core labour standards.</para></talk.start><para>Earlier this week a massive gas explosion ripped through the Sunjiawan coalmine in north-eastern China, killing more than 200 workers. This is a great tragedy for the families of those workers and their communities, and I am sure all Australians extend their deepest sympathy to them. The incident itself is particularly concerning because the Sunjiawan colliery is one of the bigger, more modern mines in China and because the blast follows a complete overhaul of safety ordered by the Prime Minister. This followed two earlier underground disasters late last year in which 166 miners were killed in Shaanxi and 148 killed in Henan. Officially, and interestingly, it is reported that more than 6,000 workers were killed in coalmines alone in China last year. But human rights and labour organisations claim that the real figure is closer to 20,000 deaths per year.</para><para>I hope we would agree on both sides of the parliament that the main goal of economic development and trade is to advance the human condition. I hope we would also agree that respect for human life and the protection of human rights is and must remain at the core of all our public policy. As the President of the ACTU noted earlier this week, free trade advocates would argue that the market will automatically provide for improvements in living standards for working people and for the protection of their human rights. This ignores the fact that all markets are actually regulated at some level. For example, the World Trade Organisation establishes trade rules incorporating a dispute resolution process and an enforcement mechanism, and those rules are supported by all the major nations. Similarly, the International Labour Office promulgates international labour standards to assure human rights and effective minimum standards for working people and employer representatives, yet these rules are seen by the major nations as a fetter on market forces.</para><para>Our government, unfortunately, refuses to sign ILO Convention 176, the Safety and Health in Mines Convention, not because our mining industry cannot meet it but because it is a government ideologically opposed to the rights of working men and women to guaranteed minimum labour standards and to the right of the ILO to promote them. This is a government committed to dragging Australian labour standards, including health and safety, down to the lowest common denominator of the trading nations. This is unacceptable to the opposition and it is unacceptable to the great majority of working men and women in Australia. We in the Labor party believe in the right to collectively bargain and in the need for effective minimum standards to provide the market with parameters that ensure working men and women get a fair share of the fruits of their endeavours. Core labour standards are also essential to guarantee more sustainable development and rising standards of living for people in poorer countries. There is no trickle-down effect.</para><para>At the moment China is the key market supporting Australia's resources boom, but it is also a potential competitor in resources trade and it is certainly a competitor in manufacturing. It is therefore incumbent on the government, when entering discussions with China about bilateral trade, to also talk about equal core labour standards that uphold the rights of working people to a safe workplace, the right to fair minimum wages and conditions and the right to collectively bargain. It is time for the government, too, to look at the track record of companies on labour practices when they invest in this country, particularly in the area of health and safety. This is one of the areas in which the Treasurer and the Foreign Investment Review Board could, and should, impose conditions on foreign investment in the nation's best interest. </para><para>It is time for Australia to play a bigger role in international labour markets, particularly in promoting health and safety in the workplace and respect for human life. International trade negotiations are one of the key avenues we can and must use to do this. It is now up to our trade negotiators in the proposed Australia-China free trade agreement to have regard to these accepted minimum international standards, core working standards developed by a tripartite process at the International Labour Office—employer, worker and government representatives—standards which any decent human being would expect. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Mr Mamdouh Habib</title><page.no>1</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>1</page.no><name role="metadata">Wood, Jason, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WOOD</name><name.id>E0F</name.id><electorate>La Trobe</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I stand here today to highlight the threats we face in the war on terrorism. As a former senior sergeant with the Victoria Police Counter Terrorism Coordination Unit, this issue is particularly close to me. Australians abroad have endured much heartache at the hands of terrorists from the September 11 plane crashes in America to the bombing of the Sari nightclub in Bali. The threat of terrorism still hangs over Australia, and our darkest hour may be yet to come.</para></talk.start><para>The release of Mamdouh Habib from Guantanamo Bay and his recent interviews raise the dilemma: is he a terrorist or a person who for no reason has been targeted by authorities both here and abroad? As Habib was recently released and has spoken openly about his experiences in detention, which have been well reported in the media and by the Australian Labor Party, I feel it is important to look at what we currently know about his experiences prior to his arrest in Pakistan in 2001.</para><para>In 1991, while in New York, Habib was invited by Ibrahim el-Gabrowny to rally support outside the courthouse where el-Gabrowny's cousin el-Sayyid Nosair was standing trial for the murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane. Apart from Habib and el-Gabrowny, Nosair's supporters in the courtroom included Mahmud Abouhalima. Abouhalima, el-Gabrowny and Habib were all followers of Omar Abdul Rahman, otherwise known as the `blind sheikh'—a militant cleric who calls for his followers to kill the enemies of God. Habib continued to have contact with el-Gabrowny and Omar Abdul Rahman after leaving New York. He even rallied other members of his Sydney mosque to help Rahman financially and to protest against his imprisonment.</para><para>On 26 February 1993, a bombing at the World Trade Centre in New York killed six people and injured over 1,000. Habib's friends, Abouhalima, el-Gabrowny and Rahman were all later arrested, charged and convicted for their involvement with the World Trade Centre bombing in 1993. Back in Australia, Sheikh Abu Ayman, head of the Haldon Street prayer hall in Lakemba, told the ABC's <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners </inline>program entitled `Worst of the Worst?' that Habib was lobbying for members to join a jihad and that he had turned up to the prayer hall wearing a ninja outfit on one occasion and an Osama bin Laden t-shirt on another. </para><para>Habib would later assist fundraising efforts for the Chechen rebels. There are reported links between the Chechnya rebels and al-Qaeda but, regardless, Chechen rebels have been responsible for a range of terrorist attacks, from the 700 hostages taken at the Moscow theatre in October 2002 to the Beslan school massacre in September 2004, where over 320 people, half of them children, were killed.</para><para>Habib's behaviour at the Haldon Street prayer hall led to Sheikh Abu Ayman banning him from the group. In 2000, Habib travelled to Pakistan for two months and upon his return announced his plans to go to Afghanistan to join the bin Laden camp. Mr Habib's friend Ibrahim Fraser told <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners </inline>that, in a conversation they had had, Habib had explained that he wanted to live in a bin Laden camp and that it would be a good life.</para><para>On 29 July 2001, Habib again visited Pakistan. It is believed that during this visit Mr Habib travelled to Afghanistan, as well as to Pakistan, and participated in an advanced al-Qaeda training course. Habib was captured after the September 11 attacks in Pakistan with two Germans: Ibrahim Diab and Bekim Ademi. Diab and Ademi were part of the Hamburg al-Qaeda cell led by Mohammed Atta, the lead hijacker in the September 11 attacks. Diab and Ademi were arrested after participating in an al-Qaeda training camp near Kabul.</para><para>Habib has not provided details as to why he was in Afghanistan, preferring to keep this a mystery, even during Channel 9's <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline><inline font-style="italic">,</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>where they paid him for half a story. The accounts of Mamdouh Habib's whereabouts over the past decade suggest a long association with figures tied to the al-Qaeda network, a keen interest in fundraising for convicted terrorist figures, and a person who has tried to recruit others to support a jihad holy war and who has a travel itinerary based around Afghanistan, which at the time was a haven for terrorists.

Mark was elected on 29 January 1994. It was appropriate that he was the member for Werriwa given that his mentor—the great Gough Whitlam—represented that seat with such distinction, including as Prime Minister in the years between 1972 and 1975. Mark Latham's service federally followed other public service, in particular his service as a local councillor on Liverpool council between 1987 and 1994 and as mayor from 1991.</para></talk.start><para>Mark had humble origins. He was proud of being a `houso'. He never shied away from being the boy from Green Valley. He was a person of ideas. He was a prolific writer. He helped write five books, most notably <inline font-style="italic">Civilising global capital: new thinking for Australian Labor</inline>. He was a great communicator verbally, and I think this was his greatest asset. He was articulate, clever, incisive, passionate and humorous. He could be tough. He was devastating on his opponents, but he could also be gentle, as he was when he spoke about his mum, and that certainly endeared him to me on a personal level. </para><para>I did not always agree with Mark's views—far from it. We had major disagreements over economic policy and social policy both within and outside the forums of the Australian Labor Party. Mark, however, was always prepared to engage in political debate. He was indeed a great political figure. Whether you agreed with him or not, he always made a difference; you noticed that Mark Latham was there, both within and outside the party.</para><para>One of his last public forums was in my electorate of Grayndler, at Leichhardt Town Hall, on Monday, 22 November last year. We sent out invitations. People thought it was rather odd that I was doorknocking just after the election. Some 600 or 700 people filled the hall—we do not know, because it was packed. Many people were turned away. He engaged on a whole range of issues. He took questions from all comers.</para><para>I did not vote for him to be leader of the Labor Party. I believed that Kim Beazley was the best prospect to win the prime ministership. But as the leader he certainly set the agenda. He had the Howard government on the run over issues such as parliamentary superannuation and the free trade agreement, where he came up with a clever and principled solution to some of the internal disagreements the Labor Party had of moving amendments to protect the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and to protect our cultural content. In the end, the government had to cave in to a Labor position. He led a principled position in opposition to the Iraq war. I marched with Mark, young Oliver and my family at the demonstration in Sydney where more than a quarter of a million people marched in favour of peace just before that war began.</para><para>It is unfortunate that Mark's career has been cut short by ill health. I wish him, his wife, Janine, and his wonderful two boys, Oliver and Isaac, all the best. Parliamentary life is very hard; it can be particularly hard on people's health. Mark has made a decision that is in the interests of himself and his family. I am sure that all parliamentarians wish him well.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Paterson Electorate: Jetstar Fleet Maintenance Base</title><page.no>111</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>111</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I advise the House of the announcement by Jetstar at Williamtown Airport on 11 February to expand the heavy maintenance hangar at Newcastle. That is an investment of $29 million. The question is: why did they take the opportunity to choose Newcastle? There was extensive lobbying for the hangar facility for the maintenance of the A320 fleet to be located in New Zealand, in Singapore, in Hong Kong or in another area of Australia. What came through was the ability of the people in the Hunter—the skill sets that we have in the Hunter.</para></talk.start><para>There are currently 82 people working in highly skilled jobs at the Jetstar facility at Newcastle airport. What is impressive is that 25 of those people are apprentices. They are committed to developing a skills base that will serve the country well. The announcement of the $29 million investment at Newcastle airport to service the A320 fleet will lead to an additional 50 jobs over five years, and I understand that more apprenticeships will be rolled out over that period. I am pleased that this will involve upskilling young people in our local area.</para><para>We also have in my electorate, on the other side of the airstrip, RAAF Base Williamtown. One of the key aspects of RAAF Base Williamtown, and it is the premier RAAF base in Australia, is that a lot of highly skilled technicians get posted there. They discover the lifestyle of the Hunter Valley. I think I am correct in saying that one of the highest exit rates from the Air Force is to Williamtown—whether or not they go to another posting afterwards, they come back to our region, to Medowie and Salamander Bay. Those high levels of skills allowed British Aerospace to set up and build the Hawk lead-in fighters. We have a magnificent facility in our region that can service, build and develop aircraft. This project will expand on that. I can remember when this hangar facility was originally started by Impulse Airlines to service the Beechcraft 1900 aircraft. When QantasLink took over Impulse Airlines the aircraft were shifted up to the B717s—a new aircraft brought into the Australian fleet—and now we are moving to the A320s. </para><para>I am concerned at the reports of an open skies agreement between Australia and Singapore. If agreed to, this agreement will see an open arrangement for Singapore Airlines to fly from the east coast of Australia to the west coast of the USA. Singapore's Minister for Transport, Mr Yew Cheow Tong, has met with our government officials this week in Canberra. He said:</para><quote><para>It will give travellers a wider choice. I think it will result in lower fares and it will bring in additional visitors into Australia ... It is good for the economy and I do think they [the government] recognise that. There is scope for a lot more tourists in Australia.</para></quote><para>I do not dispute that, but I have to stand up for the people in my electorate. I have to stand up for the skills base on which Jetstar and Qantas have made their decision to invest in my electorate. I do not want to see competition at the expense of jobs at the airport in my electorate.</para><para>Today Qantas posted its half-yearly results to 31 December. On a revenue base of $6.4 billion, it has announced a profit before tax of $601.3 million. There are competitive pressures in the airline industry, and part of that competitive pressure is to maintain a profit so that it can service the needs of its shareholders. Qantas will be establishing 400 new flight attendants, to be based out of London. If we open up our airways to other countries—countries whose airlines are subsidised by their governments—Qantas will have to look further offshore to reduce its costs. I fear that those jobs in maintenance may end up being located offshore. We had to bid strongly against New Zealand, against Hong Kong and against Singapore to have the fleet maintenance base in Australia. I say to our Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources: do not proceed with the open skies policy, because it will be to the detriment of my workers. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Sister Janet Mead of the Sisters of Mercy was last year made South Australian of the year. She accepted the honour in Glenelg, which is within the electorate of Hindmarsh. I think of Sister Mead as South Australia's very own Mother Theresa. I know that if she reads this speech she will chastise me, because her humility is also key to the way she lives her life and the work that she does. When most of us walk down the street and see a bedraggled unkempt man stumbling towards us we instantly put up all of the barriers we can. Without thinking, we see this person as different, as bad and as a danger to us, so we ignore him, pretend we do not see him and tell ourselves that there is nothing we can do to help him. We think that it is up to him to pull himself out of the life he lives and learn how to live like the rest of us. Of course that is complete rubbish; it is all about creating reasons to turn our backs on someone in need.</para></talk.start><para>Sister Janet Mead does not tell herself those sorts of lies. She spends her life with the poorest, most marginalised and most isolated people in our society. She works with the Adelaide Day Care Centre for Homeless Persons, the Brian Burdekin Clinic and Westcare. She helps homeless people overcome the tremendous challenges they face as they live their lives. The Adelaide day care centre has created a community for homeless people. Amongst other things, they can share a cooked lunch, work in the vegie garden or fix old furniture.</para><para>It is easy to misunderstand this work as some sort of sacrifice on the part of Sister Mead, but she feels fortunate to live her life in this way. She speaks of having learned so much from the people she works with. She says that she has learned a view of the world that places love above status—what a lesson for all of us whose lives are entangled in this place. Sister Mead teaches us that what she does is within reach of all of us. It is possible to find our open-heartedness and give a little, even for those who have forgotten that they ever had a soft spot. She teaches us that, in doing so, we can grow. One day we might be brave enough to give a smile to someone who scares us and another day we might be able to make a donation or buy an edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Big Issue</inline>. In doing so, we open our hearts enough to make our lives and the lives of those we love a little easier because that is what happens when we give to others without any agenda or any expectation of getting something back.</para><para>Sister Janet Mead says she reaps the most amazing rewards from the people she works with. She tells a story of a homeless man who told her, `Life's journey is not to arrive at the grave safely in a well-preserved body but to skid in sideways, totally worn out, shouting “Holy hell, what a ride!”' We have all had the good fortune at one time or another to meet someone whose generosity and openness could make us realise that something was not quite right in our lives. Sister Janet Mead is one of those people. For all the fear that we put in the space between ourselves and anyone else who we perceive to be different from us, Sister Janet Mead teaches that we are fooling ourselves and tricking ourselves out of learning that when we ignore suffering we contribute to it.</para><para>As a society we have a great deal to learn about becoming a community. Increasingly people are finding that the teachings of Christianity can help us to connect with our world, but as we do that we must be watchful that we do not close off from others who we perceive to have lost their way. When we do help those people we must be watchful that we do not define Christian values too narrowly because, as Sister Janet Mead demonstrates each day, Jesus Christ would have turned his back on no-one. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Hinkler Electorate</title><page.no>114</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>114</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Honourable members would know I am not one easily given to hubris, but I would like to highlight the clearest possible demonstration of a turnaround of fortunes of two sectors of my electorate of Hinkler in Central Queensland. Since the Howard government came to office there have been huge improvements in national indicators such as unemployment, interest rates and inflation. We are now seeing this filter down into areas which have had endemic levels of unemployment in the past.</para></talk.start><para>My electorate of Hinkler, and for that matter the entire Wide Bay-Burnett region, is one such area. But the Wide Bay-Burnett region has experienced the biggest percentage drop in unemployment in Australia in the past 12 months, and my electorate has just had the best percentage increase in bulk-billing rates in Queensland and one of the best in Australia over the last 12 months. Wide Bay-Burnett's unemployment rate now sits at six per cent, down a full 3.6 per cent in December 2004 from December 2003. Over the same period, employment numbers, now at 99,100, increased by 10.4 per cent—a remarkable figure. This can be clearly attributed to sound economic management of the nation, which has given businesses the confidence to invest in regional areas and to provide much needed local employment.</para><para>The region has also gone ahead in the health sphere, with Hinkler's bulk-billing rate going up by 12.8 per cent between December 2003 and December 2004, and it now stands at 60.5 per cent. This might not seem significant to many members but consider this: Hinkler's bulk-billing rate has gone up by 16.9 per cent since 2002 when, in many other parts of the nation, it went down. I am confident we will see further improvements because we have not yet seen the full effect of the coalition's additional $7.65 payment for concession card holders and children under 16 or the annual impact of the doctors being paid the full schedule fee.</para><para>These two indicators fly in the face of the ALP's doom and gloom message that they put out in my electorate during the election campaign. It is the clearest possible demonstration that they were wrong. The area has often been targeted as one of the worst unemployment areas in Australia; it had endemic unemployment. We now see the electorate, as a result of our economic management, coming out of that. I congratulate the government on its focus and on behalf of my electors I thank the government for the improvements that have made an area that was very much challenged in past years a better one. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Dental Services</title><page.no>114</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>114</page.no><name role="metadata">Bird, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BIRD</name><name.id>DZP</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Some questions need to be seriously asked at this point in time and in this place.

The program reduced waiting lists and gave those in our community who could least afford it the opportunity to access dental health services that can reasonably be expected to be available in a modern first-world country. When times get a bit tough, the government is often quick to blame the states, but a cursory glance at section 51 of the Constitution shows that the powers of the federal government extend to dental services. I am sure they would not want to give away other sections of section 51, such as trade, tax, telephones and trademarks, so why the flick pass on dental health? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Flinders Electorate: Education and Training</title><page.no>115</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>115</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to talk today about the potential for technical college education within and servicing the electorate of Flinders. I want to set out the need, the opportunity and the steps forward. The need is very clear. The technical college education at state level has largely been failing young people on the Mornington Peninsula, at the top of Westernport and on Bass Coast. That is a result of changes made over a decade ago, but the gaps are there. In the towns of Hastings and Koo Wee Rup and on the Bass Coast there is a young population with needs to develop skills, be they in welding, plumbing, some form of manufacturing, engineering, marine, maritime or IT.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to that need, there are two very clear proposals which I wish to present to the House today. The first is for a technical college, under the Australian technical college system, based in the south-east of Melbourne. That college would have, at the very least, two annexes which are relevant to my electorate. The first of those would be an annex in the town of Hastings, under the Australian technical college proposal, in conjunction with Westernport Secondary College. This is something to which I am committed and for which I want to fight. What I believe about this is that if an annex of an Australian technical college were constructed at Westernport Secondary College, the opportunity would exist to help students with a marine and maritime focus to cooperate with BlueScope Steel, the Mornington Peninsula Shire, Westernport Secondary and all of the maritime related companies and firms within the area. I think that, in conjunction with a campus at Pakenham servicing Koo Wee Rup, Clyde, Devon Meadows and Lang Lang, which would have a building and agricultural focus, this is a tremendous opportunity. </para><para>The second part of the proposal is to service the Bass Coast region through the town of Wonthaggi. I believe that there is potential for an annex for a Gippsland based Australian technical college. The government is committed to a Gippsland based Australian technical college. My argument, in conjunction with Russell Broadbent, the member for McMillan, is that we should push to have some representation through a local annex in Wonthaggi. That would be a tremendous boost for the people of Phillip Island, San Remo, Granville, the hills areas, Dalyston, Kilcunda and Wonthaggi. I put those two proposals on the table. I endorse them and I am going to fight for them.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Australia: Population</title><page.no>116</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>116</page.no><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GRIERSON</name><name.id>00AMP</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to draw the House's attention to the declining birth rates in regional Australia, particularly in the Hunter-New England region, in which my electorate of Newcastle is located. The latest figures show that between 1999 and 2003 the number of mothers giving birth per year in the Hunter-New England region fell by 4.7 per cent. Statewide the figure fell by 1.1 per cent. That means the number of mothers giving birth in our region is declining more than four times faster than it is in the rest of the state. Sadly, this trend is evident in other regions of New South Wales. If it continues, regions do face the danger of terminal decline and Australia is in danger of losing one of the most important aspects of its identity.</para></talk.start><para>For a government whose junior partner is The Nationals, it is shameful that the regions do face annihilation. For a government that prides itself on family values, we have seen precious few policies to assist regional families or sustain rural and regional communities. Young people move away to gain education and do not return. Job insecurity drives people to the cities, and skills and knowledge disappear with them. Health and disability services dwindle, and the increasing costs of isolation and distance continue unchecked. Vital infrastructure that links regional communities and provides expanded market opportunities is neglected or removed. And what is the first off the block in the reform agenda of this newly re-elected government? We have had a hypocritical moral values debate about abortion, tighter wages control through a new industrial relations regime, tax cuts for the wealthy and competition deregulation that will make it harder for small business. What we do need are clever policy ideas and reform that boost productivity by sustaining regional economies, by supporting family friendly workplaces and by reducing the economic barriers to having children—not the same tired old agenda that the government will be bringing back and ramming through the Senate from July.</para><para>The Rural Doctors Association of Australia tells us that the number of GP obstetricians in New South Wales has halved since 1996. In fact the greatest medical work force shortages are in regional Australia. Recent estimates of the cost of seeing a child born last year through education from preschool to university suggest a price tag of $200,000. If you add the cost for regional parents of sending their children away for education, it will be even more. Expenditure per child-care place under the Howard government has dropped by a massive 10.2 per cent, and now we find that parents will not see a cent of the promised 30 per cent rebate on child-care fees until the 2006-07 financial year. </para><para>The essentials of raising children have become much more difficult under the Howard government. Is it any wonder then that the Australian Institute of Family Studies reports that one of the main factors dissuading people from starting a family is economic insecurity. Yet the report also found that 90 per cent of people surveyed want to have children. We must get our family policies right, especially in our regions, to allow people to fulfil their parenting dreams. The Howard government's cynical regional rorts scheme may have bought it another term in government, but it will never be a substitute for the real policies needed to help families in regional Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Bulk-Billing</title><page.no>117</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>117</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The member for Newcastle is quite correct when she points out that the declining birth rate is one of the challenges that we face as a nation. The combination of the ageing population and the declining birth rate present policy challenges which this government has commenced to addressed. I do, however, wonder where the member for Newcastle stands on the issue of the Medicare funding of abortions, which is of course a conscience vote—as it should be—in this place. The fact that we have 100,000 abortions in this country each year no doubt does move in some direction towards reducing the national birth rate. However, I did not rise in this chamber to talk about that particular topic at this time.</para></talk.start><para>I am pleased to announce that the bulk-billing rate in my electorate of Fisher has continued to rise as a result of the Howard government's investment in Medicare and is now at 70.2 per cent. The bulk-billing rate in Fisher increased 10.3 percentage points in 2004 compared with 2003. This latest increase shows that the Howard government's investment in Medicare is delivering more affordable GP services for everyone living on the Sunshine Coast and in surrounding regions. This increase in Fisher reflects the national trend. The health minister has done a wonderful job in helping to boost the rate of bulk-billing. The national GP bulk-billing rate is at its highest level in 2½ years. The rate increased again during the December quarter 2004 and is now 72.4 per cent, an increase of 5.9 percentage points since the government introduced its Medicare package a year ago. The national GP bulk-billing rate for people 65 years of age and over also increased during the December quarter to its highest level in almost four years of 82.7 per cent, an increase of 8.7 percentage points on the December quarter of 2003.</para><para>Locally, as well as nationally, more than seven out of 10 GP attendances are being bulk-billed, and across the nation more than eight out of 10 GP attendances for people over 65 are being bulk-billed. This is the first time in 10 years that the national bulk-billing rate has increased over four successive quarters. GPs who bulk-bill Commonwealth concession card holders and children under 16 receive an extra $5.10 or $7.65, depending on their location. This is in addition to a recent increase in the Medicare rebate to $30.85. GPs now have more incentive to bulk-bill their patients—for example, if a GP in Tasmania bulk-bills a concession card holder or child then he or she will receive $38.50. This compares with a rate of $25.70 in November 2003. Since the introduction of bulk-billing incentives, all states and territories have experienced an increase in GP bulk-billing rates. In my state of Queensland, the most wonderful part of the country in which to live, the bulk-billing rate has increased by 7.6 percentage points to 69.3 per cent. The government do have the recipe right. We are delivering for Australians, particularly those Australians who are fortunate enough to live on Queensland's wonderful Sunshine Coast. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Paterson's curse is a weed which, no doubt, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, in your role as a rural member, you would only too well understand. It is a noxious weed to livestock. It spreads like another suburban weed, lantana—and like lantana its flowers are purple. When you see a field of it off in the distance and do not know what it is, you might think it is rather picturesque. But, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a curse.</para></talk.start><para>It is a curse because it is virtually impossible to get rid of and it can kill off your livestock. Paterson's curse also applied to the federal seat of Paterson, which, since it was recreated in 1993, had not been won by the sitting member once. Last year, I broke politics' Paterson's curse. I want to recognise that there are many new members in this parliament and I want to remark on the people that they have replaced. When I was voted out in 1998 it took me a long time to come to terms with failure. For the first time I had to take a long hard look at what I did when I was the member for Paterson. I have done that again this time around and I can honestly say it is much nicer to analyse the results from my current position, as opposed to the position I was in after the election in 1998.</para><para>We in the coalition showed that elections in marginal seats do not start when the election is called—they run over the entire term. We—my staff and I—worked very hard to attract more funding, better services and better representation over the entire three-year period. We never gave up fighting for the things that were important to the people in Paterson. It is a fight we will continue over the next term of this government and beyond. We have a hunger to improve services and get more funding for areas such as aged care, roads and health.</para><para>Paterson has four local government areas in its boundaries: Port Stephens, Dungog, Gloucester, and Great Lakes, as well as small parts of the cities of Maitland and Newcastle. Two of these areas are coastal, two are rural and the parts of Maitland and Newcastle are regional, almost urban. The coastal communities are largely made up of retirees. The bay areas of Fullerton Cove, Stockton Bight, Fingal Bay, Shoal Bay, Nelson Bay, Salamander Bay, Tanilba Bay and Lemon Tree Passage are attracting more affluent retirees. In Foster-Tuncurry in the north the retirees are not as affluent as they are in the south. Statistics show they are about five years older on average than their counterparts in the lower part of the electorate. The Maitland area, including Thornton and Morpeth, is a more prosperous area. Thornton is one of the fastest growing suburbs in the state and there are many young families in the suburb. </para><para>Beresfield, Woodbury and Tarro are older suburbs that are affordable for low-income earners and still in an area which is close to health, transport and education facilities. The shire of Gloucester is a farming area for mainly dairy and beef. Farmers have done it tough over the past two years or so, with many experiencing hardship as a result of the drought and dairy deregulation. Every small town along the Bucketts Way—Limeburners Creek, Allworth, Booral, Stroud, Stroud Road, Wards River, Craven and Stratford—has a popular hall, a voting place and a need for better roads, schools and, indeed, basic access to health care. Every small community along the Pacific Highway, whether it be Karuah, North Arm Cove, Tea Gardens, Hawks Nest, Nerong, Bulahdelah, Wootton, Coolongolook or Nabiac, has a hall, church or a meeting place. These communities may have a rural fire service or a church volunteer group. They may have a popular hall which is maintained by a small number of hardworking community committees.</para><para>The results for Paterson in the 2004 election varied from a primary vote swing to me of two per cent in the areas which were traditionally liberal to around 12 per cent in the areas which I would have considered Labor heartland. I am deeply humbled by the result. Although the election was in October last year this has been my first opportunity in the parliament to thank those who have helped me in the campaign. We expect our staff to know a little about a lot of things. We expect them to know about tax, telecommunications and Centrelink, to have a good local knowledge of our electorates, to keep us informed and on time and to get us to the right place. We ask them to work incredibly long hours during the sitting weeks and the non-sitting weeks. Then we back up and expect them to put in three times the effort during an election.</para><para>I want to personally thank my staff—Mike, Anna and Julia—for being such a tremendous support to me and our community over the past years. I also want to thank my campaign team for their tremendous work: Bob Geoghegan, the campaign director and John Murphy, the treasurer. On the advisory team I want to thank Josh Hodges, Sally Dover, Michelle Moffatt, Daryl Lewis and Peter West. I want to thank Sally Dover's husband, Gary, and Alan Ray for driving my mobile office around the electorate for me when Daryl could not. And thank you to Alan's better half, Marty Ray, for keeping him company. It was a sad day when the mobile office rolled and was written off a week out from polling day. But, within days, I had a replacement on the road to make sure the people did not forget me and were not denied access.</para><para>On polling day, there were around 600 people working for me in the electorate of Paterson, and I sincerely thank them for all their help. I cannot name them all in the time allowed, but there are some community leaders that I would like to thank—Ross Presgrave; Margaret Godsmark; Gerry Jermon; Sue Slater; Jan McWilliams; Peter Mason and his wife, Anne Mason; Trevor and Jacquie Wark; Sean and Robyn Brennan—who have all become community leaders through the Port Stephens crime forum work. Doreen Bradley, a natural leader in her community who has been recognised with an OAM, has become a great supporter because we stood up and fought for the issues that were important to her and her community.</para><para>I would like to thank the Young Liberals team, who letterboxed the hilliest parts of our electorate. My thanks also go out to the former state director, Scott Morrison, who managed the state secretariat better than it had ever been managed before. We will miss you. At the end, I owe especial thanks to my brothers and sisters in Christ in the Raymond Terrace Christian Life Centre, in particular my pastors, Colin Haddow and Rod Smith. All members in this House need the support of their families, and my especial thanks go to my wife, Cynthia, who gives me unconditional support, my twin sons, David and Robbie—I had the proudest moment last Sunday in witnessing their first parade as naval cadets from training ship <inline font-style="italic">Tobruk</inline>—and of course my daughter, Samantha. I thank them all. </para><para>Now that we are well and truly on our way in this new term of government, I want to highlight some of the issues that we are fighting for in Paterson. Firstly, I will address the issue of schools and RAAF Base Williamtown. Salt Ash Public School in my electorate is affected by aircraft noise from the RAAF weapons range at Salt Ash. This has been the case for a number of years, which is why it was a ridiculous state of affairs when the New South Wales government had just completed building a new classroom without noise amelioration. The Minister for Defence and I announced that we would fix the New South Wales government's botched job and build a new library, this time with appropriate noise insulation. The Salt Ash Weapons Range has had a significant impact on the learning of children at that school and also the Williamtown Public School, for which I have also successfully lobbied for amelioration measures.</para><para>In the case of other schools in my area, the P&amp;Cs are almost tearing their hair out, trying to get the right facilities for their children. Grahamstown Public School was built only 10 years ago by the state government, long after the base was built, so it included noise attenuation measures. But it was built without airconditioning. This means that in summer they cannot shut the doors because it is too hot, and in the winter they cannot shut the doors because the fumes from the gas heater are dangerous. That is why I am so pleased that the public schools will now be able to apply directly to the Australian government for funds instead of going through the state government, as a part of our $700 million package. This means that Grahamstown Public School P&amp;C can apply for funding for airconditioning directly from the Australian government and not worry about the New South Wales education department deeming it not to be a priority.</para><para>The P&amp;Cs of all of the schools in my electorate, whether they be in Dungog, Medowie, Gloucester, Stroud Road, Forster or Bulahdelah, to mention a few, can apply for funding. Last year, we faced the hottest November on record, yet the roll-out program for airconditioning in schools is over four or five years. But, for the first time, parents and teachers do not have to worry about any roll-out program developed by an overpaid policy officer in an airconditioned office in Sydney. We will deliver results.</para><para>The other issue I would like to raise in relation to education is my continued push for a high school in the Medowie-Tilligerry area. Finally, we have the state government waking up to the fact that this is a growing and developing area, with a number of students, that will support the existence of a high school.</para><para>Turning my attention now to health matters in my electorate, I received letters of congratulation from a pensioner in Salamander Bay. I sorted out a Medicare matter for him earlier in the year, and in the process of the correspondence he made some remarks about politicians and how we do not look after our constituents. I did not hear anything from this pensioner until about one week after the election, when he wrote to me and thanked me for my help. He said he voted for me on the back of that help. I was flummoxed, because I thought he had voted informal or, worse, for a minor party. </para><para>His comments about bulk-billing and the cost of visiting a doctor helped me give the Prime Minister and health minister feedback on what we should do with Medicare. Even though bulk-billing has risen from 53.3 per cent to 59.7 per cent, no doctors are bulk-billing in the bay area, and a policy which did not recognise bulk-billing black spots would not work. People would have to change doctors to get the benefit of a policy. A full rebate will work for people like Claude.</para><para>I mentioned that in the top end of my electorate there were many who are considered frail aged. One of my volunteers, Richard, who did some letterboxing for me, is 78 years of age. But he is one of the many older Australians who no longer drives but walks everywhere. Some older drivers elect to have a restricted licence which gets them to the nearest business district. I want to thank the health minister for recognising this mobility issue and announcing a Medicare office for the Forster-Tuncurry area. Richard will now be able to walk to the Medicare office to claim his rebate.</para><para>But there are still holes in the health service in this area. We need public hospital facilities in the Great Lakes area, and I will keep on pushing our state government for some action. We have a private hospital in Forster called Cape Hawke Hospital. It has a complete floor of beds waiting to be developed. It defies logic why the state government will not enter into an arrangement to lease these beds to provide access for all in our community. The state government seem to think that hospital facilities in Taree are adequate for the burgeoning population in Forster-Tuncurry, Smiths Lakes and the Pacific Palms areas, but they simply do not understand. In the lower part of my electorate, Port Stephens desperately needs a hospital, but the New South Wales government will not even fund a feasibility study into whether the population in this area warrants a fully fledged hospital. The polyclinic at Nelson Bay, like our local schools, has had to fundraise to get airconditioning.</para><para>Turning my attention to telephones, we clearly want to improve communications in communities like Hawkes Nest, Tea Gardens, Vasey and Gresford. They need the internet to do business, both with business and the government. They need reliable landlines in case of emergencies and a mobile phone service that is not full of patches. A reliable communications service via the internet and a phone is just as vital in rural communities as good roads. In fact, I would argue that reliable internet and telephone services are more vital in towns further away from the city than they are in the city itself. I am not sure if many people in city electorates are aware of this, but some milk manufacturers now expect dairy farmers to submit their tenders via the internet. Any city member who argues that you cannot realistically expect a city-quality service in the bush should tell that to the milk manufacturers.</para><para>The difference between high-speed internet access and dial-up could be worth tens of thousands of dollars to a dairy farmer. I say this emphatically because areas such as Dungog and Gloucester have done it tough with deregulation. I would like to commend the former minister for communications and the current minister for continuing to upgrade the facilities to provide the internet to rural areas and for continuing to fix mobile telephone black spots. The geography of my electorate consists of hills and valleys. This causes mobile phone black spots, and both Vasey and Gresford have had new mobile phone towers switched on.</para><para>If there is one issue in my electorate that used to cause a huge amount of frustration with my constituents, and in some places it still does, it is that of television reception. For many of the elderly in my electorate television is their only source of entertainment and information. It sounds a bit fickle but, if a retiree is 80 and bedridden, this is the only form of entertainment and information that they have. For everyone else, staying in touch via the news or watching one or two favourite programs a year is all they expect. Earlier this year the new television booster tower for Stroud was switched on. It is still being adjusted to ensure a perfect picture every time, but at least it is up. Funding has been approved for similar towers in Booral, Elizabeth Beach and Smiths Lakes, which are operational. Funding of almost $750,000 was announced in mid-2004 for a television tower for the bay area in my electorate. It is a project that I am committed to. I will keep lobbying all of the stakeholders until we have the digital retransmission facility established on Gan Gan Hill. </para><para>In the area of aged care I am determined to get more aged care beds and funding for my electorate as a part of the government's roll-out of beds over the next three years. The minister for ageing has done a tremendous job since taking over this portfolio, continuing the work of former ministers and ensuring this area is well funded to support the growing needs throughout Australia. Many people come to retire in my electorate. The provision of aged care services that they may need in later years is an important part of their decision to move to communities such as Forster-Tuncurry and Port Stephens. If a person needs a nursing home they want to get into one near their families and friends. This is critically important.</para><para>I would also like to express my absolute zeal for bed places for couples. After years of marriage, raising a family and spending every night together, it is right that people can spend their nursing home days together too. The number of aged care places in the electorate of Paterson has doubled under the Howard government. Over the next three years it will increase substantially, with 940 places to be distributed in the Hunter region and 765 to be distributed in the mid North Coast region as part of the government's $2.2 billion Investing in Australia's Aged Care: More Places, Better Care Program.</para><para>We have had developments open up in the past six months, including the Port Stephens Gardens Nursing Centre in Salamander Bay, which is a 120-bed facility, and the opening of the Kularoo Gardens expansion in Forster. In the near future we hope to see Barclay Gardens in Tuncurry open, the expansion of the Myall Lodge in Hawks Nest, the expansion of the Great Lakes Nursing Home in Bulahdelah and the expansion of the Lara Aged Care Facility in Dungog—not forgetting the recently opened expansion of the GLAICA nursing home in Tuncurry.</para><para>I will continue to fight for one of the most important issues in my electorate, and that is roads. I have fought for a great deal of funding for projects in my electorate, such as the $20 million investment in Buckett's Way and the $25 million investment for Weakley's Drive. These projects, when completed, will bring great benefits to many communities. No-one should underestimate the importance of improved roads to the economies of regional areas. There are roads in the Dungog Shire—about which Mayor Steve Low and I have spoken on many occasions—which council cannot afford to fix on their current income. To make matters worse, they are ineligible for state government funding for particular roads.</para><para>Then there is the popular tourist route of Lakes Way, which links the Pacific Highway and Forster-Tuncurry with communities such as Pacific Palms and Smiths Lake. Tourist operators have told me how they tell motorists to take the alternative Pacific Highway route, instead of the scenic Lake's Way, because of concerns for their safety. To assist councils that cover these particular roads, the Australian government made a commitment during the election for $10 million to be spread across the Dungog, Port Stephens and Great Lakes shires, a commitment which must be matched by the state government. I have written to the New South Wales Minister for Roads, Michael Costa, about this project and the need for their support. I am hoping that he will take up our offer and improve the roads in my electorate. </para><para>In conclusion, health, communications, aged care and roads are just some of the issues I will continue to fight for in Paterson in this term of government. This is my first consecutive term as a member of parliament, and I want to let my constituents know that I am just as motivated this time as I was the very first day I was elected to this parliament. I would like to thank the people of Paterson for putting their faith in me, and everyone—from staff to volunteers—who has helped me along the way. It is an honour to represent the people of Paterson in this place of government, and that honour should never be treated lightly. I will give them the service that not only they expect but, more importantly, they deserve.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>123</page.no><name role="metadata">Stone, Dr Sharman, MP</name><name role="display">Dr STONE</name><name.id>EM6</name.id><electorate>Murray</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to use this opportunity today to talk about some very serious issues affecting the Australian economy. We all know that Australia has traditionally addressed skills shortages through mass migration programs. From the 1950s, public infrastructure—for example, the huge Snowy Mountains scheme—was built using migrant labour, with many individuals, but also families, moving away from the war-torn zones of the Northern Hemisphere. Those people—they were often skilled but some were not skilled—worked initially on a whole range of government supported programs before moving into the wider economy. As we know, the original migrants who came in that period and their descendents form the backbone of our society today.</para></talk.start><para>We are very grateful for the mix and the cultural diversity that that migration wave brought, especially to areas like the great Goulburn and Murray valleys in my electorate, which are probably two of the most multiracial and multicultural communities in Australia. We are proud of that. That diversity has brought a richness of culture and resulted in a tolerant society. Our economy has been built on the hard work of these people, who have come to this country often with nothing more than a cardboard suitcase and a will to work.</para><para>Today Australia shares with most other developed economies a significant and growing shortage of skilled workers. This is a problem that is acknowledged throughout the OECD. Over a million skilled Australians—mostly younger people—are working offshore, taking opportunities for professional advancement, perhaps with better pay. Certainly it is a chance for them to develop their careers, but we hope they will come back. On the other side of the coin, Australia depends on the flow from other countries of, in particular, health service professionals. Most rural and regional hospitals, particularly those in the public hospital system and certainly those in my part of the world, depend on overseas trained doctors. For example, over 70 per cent of the doctors in Goulburn Valley Health, which is the main Shepparton public hospital, are from overseas. They are very welcome and we appreciate their presence. Our health services would collapse without them.</para><para>Successive Australian governments have tackled the skills shortages. I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks the mass migrations of the fifties and a little before then. No government has as conscientiously and successfully tackled the skills shortages, especially for rural and regional Australia, as the Howard government. I commend in particular the Regional Skilled Migration Scheme and the recent changes which have allowed offshore students to stay in Australia, under certain careful criteria, if they have employment in a rural area. I commend the Howard government for understanding that we need skilled migrants to come into this country and work in rural and regional Australia. </para><para>What I am equally concerned about is the unskilled labour category, comprising those who are prepared to do manual work, particularly the seasonal manual work that is absolutely essential for our horticulture industry, in which I include vegetables, nursery production, fruit and nuts and some viticulture. Some vines are able to be machine picked. In 2000, the gross value of production of horticulture was $5.5 billion, with a farm gate value of $4.7 billion. This production is dependent on access to labour in the form of pickers, pruners, planters and people who are prepared to work in packing sheds. This is seasonal work. Unfortunately farm enterprises typically cannot afford, or do not have the work, to offer jobs for a whole season. There is often a peak period in which they require a certain number of pickers—in the case of the Goulburn Valley, some 8,000 to 10,000 pickers and, in the following months, about half that number to do pruning. Without that labour, quite simply our horticultural industries cannot expand. They cannot take advantage of the growing access to the fresh fruit and vegetable, nut and honey markets that we have worked hard to develop access to.</para><para>We have a serious issue of illegal workers in the harvest areas. As we speak, a number of raids are going on in my electorate of Murray and in the neighbouring electorate of Mallee. Just two days ago some 40 or so illegal workers were picked up on some vegetable farms. Those workers came from Cambodia, Thailand and other near neighbours in Asia. They were cutting and harvesting vegetables—a high-value crop for domestic and export markets. Those farmers, those property owners, now have no labour. Those crops will need to be ploughed in. They cannot obtain additional or alternative labour. Of course they were not aware that those people were illegal. Some of them had been employed for over four years and they had been obtained through a contract labour hire service. It was the understanding of the farmers that those workers had the right to work in Australia. Sadly, it turns out they did not. Of course the owners of those properties do not support illegal work in Australia. On the other hand, they are faced with this extraordinary dilemma. How do they produce magnificent product in regions where the irrigation infrastructure has been built at public expense over a hundred years, where they have the soils, the climate and the clean green image? All is there for them to prosper but they cannot obtain the labour.</para><para>A number of countries, particularly many of our competitors in agricultural production, have overcome this problem with visas and market labour programs that bring in seasonal workers. Most countries have temporary worker programs for both high- and low-skilled workers. Some have separate programs for IT professionals, health-care workers, managers and executives, but there are special programs for farm workers—and also for maids and caregivers in some countries. There is always a concern in Australia that an overseas worker might literally `disappear' into the economy after their visa expires, because we are such a multiracial, multicultural society and we have such a huge continent. Obviously compliance issues are very difficult in Australia because we are such an open country in terms of movement. But other countries have come up with some quite careful and workable solutions—obviously negotiated with the home country and with the workers themselves. The negotiations have included such conditions as withholding part of their payments—this is of course with the workers' permission—until they are literally on their way back to their home country; not having families arrive with the workers but just having individuals come so that there is a greater incentive for them to return; and compliance with a temporary work visa creating the opportunity to return year after year, for perhaps six or nine months of the year, to work as a seasonal worker. </para><para>While I am talking about horticulture—fruit growing, vegetable growing, nuts, harvesting and table grapes—the same issues also affect Australia's hospitality industry, where there is a chronic shortage of workers, and our rag trade. But let me focus at the moment on the issue that most significantly affects my electorate, which is the access to labour for horticulture. I want to mention a couple of programs used by other countries. Canada, for example, has the Commonwealth Caribbean and Mexican Agricultural Seasonal Workers Program, or ASWP. It has allowed Canadian farmers to import foreign workers for up to eight months a year from the Caribbean since 1966 and from Mexico since 1974. About 80 per cent of these ASWP migrants are employed in fruit, vegetable and tobacco farms in Ontario. Their average stay in Canada is four months.</para><para>Mexicans are recruited and employed under the terms of a government-to-government memorandum of understanding that makes the Mexican Ministry of Labor responsible for recruiting workers and negotiating their wages with Human Resources Development Canada, a government agency. The admissions process begins with farm employers applying to local Human Resources centres for certification to employ the foreign workers, at least eight weeks before they are needed. There is, of course, always a preference for Canadian workers under the Canadians First policy, but if there is evidence that no Canadian nationals are available then farmers may access these foreign workers. They must pay them an agreed piece rate or the prevailing wage.</para><para>There can be absolutely no intention of exploiting labour from countries where salaries or piece work payments may be substantially lower than in the Australian economy. Their housing, their access to health services and every other condition of their work must be equivalent to Australian working standards. There must be no possibility of exploitation of these people. In the Canadian experience, migrants are given entry papers in their countries of origin, and a special Foreign Agricultural Resource Management Services agency affiliate arranges to transport these workers to Canada and to the employer who has applied for them. Farmers advance the cost of transportation from Mexico to Canada and deduct four per cent of workers' wages to cover the transport costs. Farmers also deduct payroll taxes and insurance costs from their workers' pay, and there is a 14-day probation period after their arrival.</para><para>Other countries have similar sorts of programs. Swiss programs, for example, are long established, and indeed that country totally depends on foreign workers. In December 2001, foreigners in the Swiss work force represented 25 per cent of all workers. Of those, 20 per cent had renewable one-year work permits and 18 per cent were border commuters. Switzerland's agriculture based industries could not continue without these workers, but there are certain conditions of compliance associated with their programs.</para><para>With regard to the French programs, the numbers of seasonal foreign workers admitted for employment in agriculture rise and fall. In 1972 a peak of 138,000 seasonal foreign workers were admitted into France. Two-thirds came from Spain; two-thirds were employed to do the grape harvest. The admission process began with French farmers having their need for foreign workers certified by local labour officers. Spanish workers were then requested by name by French employers, and many arrived by train in work crews that could shift from employer to employer. French employers paid for worker transportation and provided housing. It has been noted that the recruitment of seasonal foreign workers for agriculture was not halted with the recruitment of foreign workers who came in for other purposes. There has been a shrinking and expanding of the need for workers in France for agriculture, but in the late 1990s almost 11,000 seasonal foreign workers were admitted. In fact, in 2001, there were 11,000 seasonal workers for agriculture; half came from Morocco and 43 per cent came from Poland. </para><para>I want to emphasise the success of programs in other countries. Many of us are also aware of the longstanding guest worker programs in countries such as the United States, in particular—and I have already mentioned Canada. They have a very well-known program where they try very hard to ensure the rights of workers and to ensure that those who come through the borders illegally are not exploited but, rather, go through a legal process. That gives the farmers access to seasonal work, which means that the Californian industries have survived and thrived, many of them in competition with Australia's agribusiness.</para><para>Israel also has a longstanding worker program, where teams of workers arrive from the Middle East and other neighbouring countries for only, on some occasions, four months of work on their kibbutzim to meet the seasonal peaks of their horticultural demand. The workers return with apparently very little loss in terms of overstaying. Israel's horticultural industry's prosperity is linked to their access to this labour.</para><para>I have been speaking to our Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. She is very aware of this problem and is concerned about making sure that we have immigration programs in Australia that do not lead to overstaying or exploitation. We, of course, have sex industry problems in Australia, where illegal workers are brought into this country. Women are very significantly exploited when this happens, but we have introduced sex slavery legislation into this House to ensure that we can properly prosecute those who use illegal workers in our country in the sex industry.</para><para>These are very serious issues associated with guest workers that I know our government is keen to address and will address. I want to make the point, however, that enforcing compliance, with the so-called raids that are undertaken in horticulture to find illegal workers, is costly. Perhaps the cost is more than that of administering a scheme of introduced seasonal workers where the rules are very carefully thought through. If we take the very best of the systems that have been introduced overseas, we can then solve a number of problems. We can have our multibillion dollar horticultural industry thrive and our export industries grow. We can remove the incentive for illegal overstays, and we can perhaps build on our relationships with our near neighbours, particularly in Asian countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, who have numbers of workers only too willing to come to Australia for short terms. We can build relationships further, with close connections between certain districts and regions in those countries and our horticultural regions in Australia. The need is very great, and I know we will find a solution. I look forward to working with the minister in developing a solution to this problem. I want to say that the John Howard government is one of the first to be serious about regional employment issues, and I commend the skilled migration programs that are bringing us workers for the first time in decades. But the seasonal worker program now needs serious attention. </para><para>Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (10.35 a.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That further proceedings be conducted in the House</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>INDIAN OCEAN TSUNAMI</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>127</page.no></debateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 8 February, on motion by<inline font-weight="bold"> Mr Pearce</inline>:</para><motion><para>That the House take note of the document.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>127</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellis, Annette, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ANNETTE ELLIS</name><name.id>5K6</name.id><electorate>Canberra</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to have this opportunity to add my voice to those in this and the other place who have already expressed their deep shock and sadness at the events of 26 December 2004. When the death toll was estimated in the thousands, I was shocked by the magnitude of the disaster. As the number of victims increased with every hour, day and news bulletin, my shock, and that of others, turned to utter disbelief. I fear that the final human cost of this disaster will never be truly known. Having spent 2½ years in Bangkok during my time with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade some years ago, I have a very deep affection and respect for the people of Thailand. There is no way to describe the sadness I feel at the thought of such a warm people, so generous in nature and rich in culture, having such a tragedy inflicted upon them. Sadly, they were not the only country so afflicted.</para></talk.start><para>Sections of the Australian and international communities have expressed in a variety of ways their support for those affected. Very soon after 26 December, I had the opportunity and the privilege here in my electorate of Canberra to attend interfaith services at the Royal Thai Embassy; St Christopher's Catholic Church, in Manuka; the City Uniting Church; the Indonesian Embassy; and the Mandir Society, in Mawson. I was immensely impressed by the level of attendance, given that one of those services was held on the morning of 1 January, New Year's Day, at a time when everybody was very much in holiday mode. Yet, when these services came along and offered an opportunity for people to gather, it became very evident that people really needed to do that. For my own part I appreciated very much the efforts behind each of those services that I attended. I understood very clearly, from my own personal feelings, the importance of gathering. Sitting at home and watching the news was one thing, but I cannot overstate how important it was to have the opportunity to get together with other people, some of whom were personally affected through family connections in some of the countries affected.</para><para>The tsunami did not respect national borders, ethnic, cultural or political differences. The water claimed the lives of people from many different religions, backgrounds and nationalities. The response to this catastrophe has been that the geographic and cultural barriers disregarded by the tsunami are also being disregarded by those seeking to support and to help repair the damage. As each country affected by the rising water began to assess the enormous task of rebuilding, in this country alone churches, synagogues, mosques, scout groups, schools, pubs, workplaces, sporting groups, neighbourhoods—every level of our society—began fundraising. I know all members of this House will join me in saying that we were both amazed and pleased by the level of generosity shown by Canberra residents and the generosity that has been mirrored around the country.</para><para>It is interesting to note that money was collected from such huge events as WaveAid right down to children collecting in their neighbourhood streets. It was a response we have never needed to see before, but it warms the heart to know that it happened. I would like to express my support, as others in this place have already, for the measures taken by the Australian government in response to the events of 26 December. I would also like to thank the government departments and individuals whose reaction to this crisis can make us all so proud. </para><para>Many Canberra residents returned early from their hard-earned leave as government departments reacted to the disaster. Being the national capital, Canberra is also home to the majority of Commonwealth public servants in this country. It is fair to say, and I do not think anybody will mind me reflecting in this way, that it can sometimes be fashionable to knock public servants—and I do not mean just politicians; I mean anybody around the country. It is quite often a bit of sport. However, the reaction of those people working in all areas of the Public Service over that period might put that kind of practice to bed for ever. There has never been a better demonstration of absolute dedication to a job or to providing a service than was seen at all levels of the public service sector following this terrible disaster.</para><para>Acting to help seems to have been an automatic reaction to the crisis rather than a conscious decision. These people simply saw what was required and went to work to respond. In the days following 26 December, the people at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade worked tirelessly to provide information to Australians seeking news of loved ones in the affected regions. To put things into perspective, I am informed that shortly after the Bali bombing the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade received around 35,000 calls. By 10 January this year, that same call centre had received over 82,000 calls, an enormous level of response and work required.</para><para>Some of the first help to get to Thailand came from the ACT hospital trauma section. Three of our medical trauma specialists were up there very quickly assisting with triage to help assist and move people as quickly as they could in those important first few days following the effect that was felt in southern Thailand. RAAF personnel were among the first Australians sent to Indonesia to help, and Australian Defence Force personnel remain in some of the worst affected areas providing, medical, logistical and other relief services. They will be there for some time. The AFP was also very involved and remains so. While so many Australians were justifiably attempting to return home as quickly as possible, the Australian armed services were preparing to send people just as quickly into Banda Aceh. I understand that some forensics teams that lent their services to the Indonesian government in the wake of the Bali bombing are now conducting DNA tests to identify, as much as possible, the unnamed victims of the tsunami. They are performing a truly unenviable task, and I believe no words expressed here can adequately describe the courage or the quality of character displayed by those people.</para><para>A Canberra resident—in fact, a constituent of mine—Percy Samara-Wickrama is a retired engineer originally from Galle in Sri Lanka. Percy has contributed to aid projects in Bosnia and Kosovo with an aid organisation known as RedR—Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief. Percy returned to Sri Lanka, to Galle, very soon after the disaster to assist in the rebuilding of two villages as part of a project called Operation Hope. One hundred per cent of funds donated to Operation Hope will go towards rebuilding those villages with a view to sustaining their long-term recovery. All administration costs are being met by Percy's family, such is his determination to help the area he was born in. I know from discussions that my officers had with Percy's son that the effort to set up Operation Hope has been enormous, and I commend very strongly the work that Percy and his family have done in that personal way to dedicate themselves to something they truly believe in. </para><para>I know that the ACT community, both through the business and professional community and just folk living out there in the electorate, are all getting behind Operation Hope and doing what they can. They can actually see a direct connection between their efforts to support this particular enterprise and the actual, physical rebuilding of a couple of villages within Percy's family's original area in Sri Lanka. I know that even local WIN TV have been following the progress of this very closely, and I commend that very strongly. This is just one example. There are so many other examples around the country where people are doing similar things.</para><para>If I or anyone else in this place were to try to name every organisation, government department or individual who deserved specific praise, I am sure we would all be here far longer than any of us have time allowed for any one speech on this issue. While the challenge of rebuilding may well be the greatest ever presented by a natural disaster on this planet, companies, charities and ordinary citizens have proved and are proving that we can and will meet this challenge. I again want to make reference to the level of response that we are seeing through all of our communities. Every one of the members and senators within this place could stand up and cite examples from their own communities where there have been wonderful responses. The type that I think epitomises it most for me has been not necessarily from here but just the photos in the papers of children setting up lemonade stalls in streets. At any level that people can, they want to be involved and they need to be involved. We can be very proud, as Australians, of seeing the sort of human response that is coming from our Australian community to this terrible disaster.</para><para>I would like once more to extend my condolences to the nations affected by this disaster. All of those nations have been named in the parliament, and I do not need to go through those again. Suffice it to say that there are far too many, and the tragic outcome is still being measured in many of those countries. I want to record, as well, on behalf of my electorate, my gratitude to our armed forces, our charities and the people of my community and of Australia generally for their collective response to this tragedy.</para><para>In conclusion, whilst the response has been, as I have said, so warm-hearted, the difficulty now, I think, will be to continue that response into the months and the years to come. The dimension of this disaster is such that things are not going to be rebuilt overnight. Continuing connection to these communities around the Indian Ocean rim is going to be needed for some years to come. I think we all are going to need to do what we can to support the ongoing rebuilding and the ongoing call for help in re-establishing lives, communities, buildings, business enterprises and community and social networks. All of those things are going to take time. I have every confidence that the Australian community will be in a position to continue that connection with these people for the years to come, because that is what is going to be required.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>129</page.no><name role="metadata">Fawcett, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FAWCETT</name><name.id>DYU</name.id><electorate>Wakefield</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the motion moved by the Prime Minister and endorse the comments of the previous speakers. Many speakers have rightly lauded the excellent work of the Australian Defence Force medical and engineering teams who have worked tirelessly to bring about real change in the areas devastated by the Boxing Day tsunami. Today, however, I wish to particularly highlight the significant contribution by the men and women of the Australian Army Aviation Corps and the Royal Australian Air Force Air Lift Group. These people deploy and operate with little publicity, but they are often the main source of mobility in areas where the ADF have served Australia, such as the drought relief in Papua New Guinea, operations in Bougainville, the Solomon Islands, Iraq, East Timor and, most recently, Banda Aceh. </para></talk.start><para>Members of 36 and 37 Squadron of the Air Lift Group have flown Hercules aircraft on a continual basis to deliver aid and to evacuate people whose lives have been devastated by the tsunami. Over 1,100 tonnes of aid have been sent from Australia to Sumatra, much of it carried by the aircraft of the Air Lift Group. Elements of the 16th Brigade Army Aviation were some of the first ADF assets deployed to Sumatra. Within days of the tsunami, 47 members of A Squadron, Fifth Aviation Regiment, had returned from leave and been deployed with four Iroquois helicopters to commence operations from Banda Aceh airport.</para><para>Members of 173 Surveillance Squadron had deployed a Super King Air aircraft to operate from Medan. To date, these Army aviators have carried over 100,000 kilograms of food, water and medical supplies as well as carrying out numerous life-saving medical evacuation flights. I should also mention the actions of Major James Brown, the A Squadron Detachment Commander, who was one of the first people on the scene when a U.S. Navy Seahawk helicopter crashed. In his actions rescuing the crew from the wreckage, he sustained injuries which required his repatriation to Australia. I wish him a full and speedy recovery.</para><para>In acknowledging and thanking the members of the Army Aviation Corps and the Air Lift Group, and the maintenance engineers who support them, I wish also to thank their families. The long period of concurrent deployments around the world of ADF aviation assets has put a huge strain on families—often young families—who remain at home. They cope with a number of pressures and uncertainties unique to having a family member deployed on operations, as well as the normal aspects of family life. I wish to take this opportunity to place on record my thanks to them for their sacrifice which allows the ADF to, yet again, play a significant part in contributing to our region and making all Australians proud.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>130</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—First of all, I would like to congratulate the Prime Minister on putting this motion before the chamber. I am sure that every single member of the House would support this motion. Certainly for my own part I can say that I endorse every jot and every particle of this motion, as I also endorsed every action that the Prime Minister and the government took in the wake of the tsunami of 26 December. The action was timely, appropriate and necessary in the face of a disaster that was then not seen to be as great as it now has been revealed to be in the fullness of time. Almost 300,000 people have had their lives destroyed and their communities devastated. The timeliness of the response and its appropriateness is what any government should have delivered—coalition or Labor. So I congratulate the Prime Minister. I also congratulate the parliamentary secretary, the member for Dunkley, Bruce Billson, who carried most of the government's practical response during the immediate aftermath of the tsunami. In doing so, I underline the fact that this is a bipartisan response to an absolutely overwhelming natural disaster.</para></talk.start><para>There are particulars within this motion that I will come back to. I simply want to look in the first instance at point (1) which says:</para><para>That the House: </para><para>(1)	extends to all Australians who suffered personal losses during the tragic 26 December Indian Ocean tsunami disaster its profound sympathy in their bereavement and wishes a speedy recovery to the injured ...</para><para>Luckily, in this disaster the level of loss of life for Australians was comparatively small when you look at the other countries affected. Sweden of course had so many thousands of its people who had their lives simply ripped away from them because they went to one destination in Thailand. Germans suffered too—not in equal measure, but still a large number of people lost their lives. Given Australians' propensity to travel to South-East Asia—and, indeed, to Thailand, one of the affected countries—and to spend their holiday periods there, we were lucky that more were not lost. I have been to Phuket with my wife. I stayed at the Sheraton resort which was devastated by this tsunami. I have stood on the beach. I swam in the water. I have been in the position of those people who, almost in the twinkling of an eye, had their lives completely turned around. It is instructive in a way to step back and think about our situation and the situation of others in current circumstances, and consider how things were different before modern communications were operating in terms of the localised responses to such things.</para><para>A little while I ago stood on a headland at Balmoral Beach, out on a rocky area near the end, just past the children's pool, and I looked out towards the Heads and back to the escarpment at Balmoral. I was thinking about the deep ocean trench between Australia and New Zealand and the fact that the eruption of an earthquake within that trench could cause a tsunami to come onto Australian beaches, and that I could be in the situation that all those hundreds of thousands of people were—here one minute, gone the next. The predictability of this is extremely low unless you have proper and effective monitoring systems, as there are in the Pacific. So at least we have those things in place and have had for a long period.</para><para>It is quite apparent that one of the major problems in the regions affected—in Banda Aceh in Indonesia, in Thailand and less so for those countries that were further away and, indeed, the ones that we did not hear about much at all—was the lack of an early warning. I had contemplated going on a holiday in Mauritius during that period. Mauritius was slightly affected but had plenty of warning because of what was apparent with regard to what happened in Banda Aceh and Thailand. It also hit the Seychelles, another Indian Ocean holiday place primarily used by people from France and other parts of Europe, and it hit the African coast as well. The result and impact there were much less, not because of the intensity of the waves but because of the early warning.</para><para>For all those Australians who lost their lives because there was not an early warning system in place, I join with all of those others from the opposition and from the government side who have said that there should be a priority placed on creating the same type of early warning system in the Indian Ocean as we have had in the Pacific Ocean for many years. We have friends who have relatives living in Thailand. Indeed, they run a business on the beach. It just so happened that on that morning, because they were caught up, they were not down on the beach running the business. They had to get children from school and they were further into the hinterland. By luck, their lives were saved. But, for all of those people who were doing the very normal thing of enjoying their holidays, when something like this emerges and sweeps them away so rapidly it is really hard to comprehend the immensity of it. I really could not get a handle on the strength of the waves or their impact until I looked at the footage. Certain camera angles can show it to you, and it was only a couple of weeks down the track that some of the home footage shot by people who were there gave a better indication of what happened in particular places. </para><para>One of the things that stands out is that the world now is very different to what it was previously. In the past, going back to prehistoric times, there were of course always natural disasters, some of which wiped out hundreds of thousands of people. But when they happened two key things were different from the situation today. The first is that in the hunter-gatherer period people were effectively in small bands. The density of the population worldwide was much less. It was not until the agricultural revolution and the creation of settled communities that we had an increasing density of population and an increasing number of people in the population who could be affected locally in one place. So in prehistoric times there were fewer people to be so affected and, because they existed in scattered bands and moved through the environment in a way that did not have as much impact as settled communities, there was less chance of being caught up in these kinds of disasters. More importantly, no-one knew what happened to individual groups of people because they were isolated from their fellows.</para><para>It is only in the period of modern civilisations, not just civilisations post the agricultural revolution but those with speedy communications, that you can get a handle on what happens in fundamental natural disasters. You only need to go back 100 years or more and the reality was that people did not hear about major natural disasters, whether it was the eruption of Vesuvius or Mount Etna or the great disaster caused by Krakatoa, until either the physical evidence was present before them—and that took some time, for instance, in regard to Krakatoa—or the associated tsunamis had happened as a result of those earthquake events in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific. There was a great deal of lag time before people found out about them. As for trying to get help and support, there was not the modern response that there has been to this tsunami.</para><para>Because of modern communications, we know about, can feel about and have empathy for those people who lost their lives or had their places destroyed. As the previous speaker indicated, with their modern transport systems, the Australian defence forces were able to take aid and assistance—medical aid, food and water—to people desperately in need of it. What the government did, supported by the opposition in a nonpartisan way, in moving as swiftly as possible to go to the aid of those people most in need of our help, was a tremendous achievement. It was an achievement that goes to the core of an Australian response—the fact that people wholeheartedly and rapidly went to the assistance of others and did so in a period when normally the country would be on holiday.</para><para>Associated with that was a very clear understanding, not only of the logistical problems that there would be in Banda Aceh, for instance, but also of the fact that targeted assistance was necessary in those places most seriously affected by the tsunami because they were the most proximate. The province of Banda Aceh suffered directly because it was closest to the undersea earthquake and had less warning time than anywhere else. Given the nature of the topography, it had a very wide area that was completely devastated, to the point where there is virtually nothing left standing. I think it is right and appropriate that Australian aid has been primarily focused there.</para><para>We also know that there has been a substantial effort in Sri Lanka, and there has been some effort as well in relation to Thailand. In fact, the Thai government have indicated that the thing we could do to help the most would be to encourage people to go on holiday to those areas again—to take up the normal response that one would see. The Thai government have the ability to rebuild their infrastructure and to handle their own demands and needs in this area themselves. But they want people to come back. They want to re-establish a sense of the necessity to support these tourist destinations by people travelling to them. </para><para>That will not happen easily unless there is a sense of sureness on the part of those people who would travel there—that is, a sense that the places are rebuilt, that they are safer in terms of the general safety of water, food and so on and that they have readily available services. For an event like this, coming with no signal, no clarion call and no time for people to respond, an early warning system must be built. In that way, people can be sure, if they are going to those places to relax and rebuild themselves in a holiday mode, that they will not have the idea that this could happen to them. The lives of all those hundreds of thousands of innocent people who were killed in this disaster should not have been lost only for this to happen again in the same way. It is absolutely critical to all of those people—not only in holiday areas but in areas like Banda Aceh, with people leading very normal lives, going about their activities—that they are able to rebuild in the hills or more mountainous areas or, indeed, on the plain again. But it is also critical that they have some protection through the use of available technologies as well as the use of our intelligence and abilities to predict these incidents and their effects better than we can.</para><para>Part of the human aspect of this is that although the early warning system for the underground earthquake registered in Australia, the results were misinterpreted. First, they thought that it was not as great as it was. Second, they did not think there would be a tsunami effect because, when you look at the gradings for seismic activity, there is an exponential factor with respect to their gravity. For example, a size seven is entirely different from a size 7½ or a size eight—or in this case, one going on for a size nine. It is always probable in human affairs that, even with the best attention to such things, people will get them wrong. This experience has been so grave and so disastrous for the entire region and those communities involved that it is imperative that we get it right.</para><para>It is also imperative that we continue to do as we have done, and that is to build and strengthen the relationship between Australia and Indonesia so that Indonesians of goodwill will understand, as they have in the past, that the present involvement of Australia and its future involvement will be to build with them to allow them to renovate, reinvigorate and rejuvenate their people and their circumstances, particularly in Banda Aceh, so that as good neighbours and good citizens of the world we can renew what was destroyed and open up for the survivors a life that is open, free and not dominated by the fear of this happening again.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>133</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In considering and remembering the tragedy of Boxing Day, the tsunami and the human loss, I recall the words of John Donne from 400 years ago. John Donne was an English cleric, author and poet. He wrote:</para></talk.start><quote><para>No man is an island, entire of himself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were ... any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. </para></quote><para>Those words, 400 years old, are as relevant today—and sadly perhaps more relevant than they were then—as one could imagine. On Boxing Day we saw that, and we saw a response which echoed the words as well, which was perhaps the bright light in an otherwise tragic episode in human history. In speaking to this motion of condolence to the tsunami victims I want to refer to three things: I want to talk briefly about the tragedy, and then about the Australian response and finally, in my role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, I want to refer to the steps forward, as I have carriage in my area of the Bureau of Meteorology, which has a significant role in warning people about the possible arrival and consequences of natural disasters.</para><para>The tragedy, as we are all aware, has probably taken 300,000 lives, and that figure may continue to grow. That figure of 300,000 was most profoundly registered in the province of Banda Aceh in Indonesia, which suffered an almost instantaneous double of earthquake and tsunami. Nothing could have been done then or now, and probably not within the next 500 years, to warn people of that kind of arrival. The process from earthquake to tsunami was almost instantaneous—within a period of 20 minutes. However, there is always a response. As we radiate out from the epicentre through the Indian Ocean region we see that there was a time lapse. We will be able to deal with and improve our warning systems on that front. However, the tragedy that affected Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka in large part, India and to a lesser extent Burma, the Maldives and even as far away as the Seychelles and the African coast, reminds us of who we are and what we have lost. It brings us together in a way that was not sought, but which is in some way uplifting.</para><para>This brings me to the second point, which is about the response. It has shown us the capacity we have as individuals, as countries, as citizens and as communities to respond in times of crisis. Sure, there was an Australian government response—which was right, appropriate, just and generous—but that is not the real focus. The real focus is what occurred in every one of our electorates. In every electorate around Australia, in every community, there was an outpouring of generosity and grief for those whom we may have not known and will never know. There was an emotional response and a practical response.</para><para>I want to acknowledge some of the practical responses within my own electorate of Flinders. Firstly, the Phillip Island <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> staff, led by the editor, Anne Oswin, worked with a series of community groups such as Rotary to create a table, which they then covered with $2 coins in the main street. That table was filled multiple times. Over the course of January it generated approximately $50,000 and led to that small community contributing a total of $100,000 to the international Red Cross. It was one little community, one small island and one simple activity. I commend Anne Oswin and the staff of the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline>, the volunteers from Rotary and all the other volunteer groups on the island. That is one example of local generosity that was replicated throughout Australia. That generosity was replicated through corporate giving and at the national level.</para><para>Whilst the government has given resources, what I think is extraordinary at the national level is the role that Australia's defence personnel have played. They have given their time, they have been drawn away from their families and they have been on the front line. The defence and medical personnel, whether it is in Banda Aceh or in other parts of the region, have played an extraordinary role. I thank them, I commend them and I acknowledge their work. </para><para>I also want to look at the steps forward. The outpouring of compassion and the response has been quick, clear and practical, and it has been uniform across the country. But the real question at this moment in history, at the beginning of the 21st century, is: what are our options for trying to avoid these sorts of disasters happening again? In Banda Aceh, nothing could be done to deal with an immediate crisis and natural disaster of this magnitude. When there is an earthquake and immediate tsunami, there will be a human tragedy. Let us not pretend that we can avoid that at this stage in our history. We simply do not have the capacity to predict an earthquake accurately to the day or the hour. We talk in decades and centuries in terms of probability.</para><para>But there are perhaps three critical steps that we can take moving forwards, which deal not just with tsunami warning systems but with the whole notion of disaster warning systems. They proceed along three fronts. The first element in any early warning system is monitoring. This is perhaps the easiest part to get right. There is a Pacific tsunami warning system based in Hawaii, but there has been no such similar thing within the Indian Ocean region. The reasons are: firstly, history and the lack of apparent need—human history is seen in the present century over decades, not over eons; and secondly, because it is a developing region and it has not been seen as a priority. We now know, with the benefit of hindsight, that it must be a priority—that we have to view our responsibilities to future generations in terms of centuries and eons, not just in terms of immediate needs. The once in a century or once in 500 year natural disaster could be now or it could be at any other time within that frame.</para><para>It is possible to provide the technological warning. That exists within the Pacific system. Australia is playing a role in coordinating through the International Oceanographic Commission that set of skills and is working towards the capabilities and the technological options within the Indian Ocean region. A system will be set up. We have already been involved through meetings in Kobe on the World Conference on Disaster Reduction and in Phuket. We will be involved in other meetings in establishing that Indian Ocean regional tsunami warning system but also more broadly in the entire disaster system.</para><para>The second element of any warning system, other than the technological capability, is education—that is, what to do in the event of an active, live warning. We have within Australia two very good models of that—bushfire and cyclone events. They need to be advanced, but in terms of public education these models can be exported and replicated throughout the Indian Ocean region. We have already committed to do that. There is a lot more to do, but we will be doing that sort of public education. We will be working within each individual country to try to encourage the development of such systems.</para><para>The third and most difficult part of any warning system is about what you might call the last mile—how you get the technology or the ability to communicate with people in rural villages in a short time frame over the last mile. We do have, through mobile technology—and I am glad that the member for Wentworth is here; he is one of the pioneers within Australia and one of the most knowledgeable people in this field—the capacity to push messages out to every mobile device and every fixed line device over the last mile through automated systems. Only this morning, I was exploring with a number of people how we can do that throughout the Indian Ocean region and also within Australia. That is something which we have not embraced yet and which we must embrace. It is the next generation of wholesale warning. But these are rural villages. These are developing parts of the world, so we also need to work on general broadcast facilities within these villages. Again, that was something we were looking at this morning. </para><para>There is a lot more to be done. These systems will not be perfect because, if we face a genuine, immediate natural disaster, there is no warning and no capacity to avoid that which is immediate. But where there is any sort of delay between event and consequence, the capacity to provide warning is something which we can do. We see now that the Indian Ocean region is vulnerable, that this was not something of the fantastic and the imaginary but potential and real. Krakatoa is not something of history; unfortunately, it is something of our present. So that is the future, that is what we have to work towards and that is what we are working towards.</para><para>Ultimately, I want to return to where I began: the notion that no man is an island and each man's death diminishes me because I am of mankind. That sentiment is with us. It is something which we forget and something which unfortunately it too often takes a tragedy to resurrect within our thinking and our being. The lesson of the last month is that, as a society, we have within us an extraordinary capacity. If we can in any way on all sides of this chamber do whatever we can to work together to try to encourage that sentiment and to encourage that sense of national unity and common humanity, then we will be doing something of real meaning for future generations. I thank all of those people, most simply signified by the people of Phillip Island, members of the Phillip Island <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> and Phillip Island Rotary for their generosity, because they tell us what we can be and they tell us what we should be.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>136</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I rise to speak on this motion in my capacity as shadow minister for health and member for Lalor, but perhaps most importantly as a human being. You would not be a human being unless you felt a strong emotional reaction to the dreadful tragedy that unfolded on our TV screens and on the pages of our newspapers from Boxing Day on. We can all probably identify different moments of that coverage which emotionally affected us. I certainly remember the Australian woman who came back to Australia with her two children but described a moment of indescribable horror when she needed to work out which child she would hold on to and which child she would let go—an almost unimaginable thing for a mother to do that we know in popular culture as <inline font-style="italic">Sophie's Choice</inline>. Fortunately for her, both of her children survived but in devastation where so many did not.</para></talk.start><para>We know that the devastation affected our region broadly: Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Burma, the Maldives, East Africa, Kenya, the Seychelles, Somalia, Madagascar, and Tanzania. The tsunami hit across our region and caused an almost unimaginable loss of life—about 290,000 people, with possibly more deaths to be recorded, and 240,000 people in Indonesia alone.</para><para>I am sure we are all aware now that the unofficial Australian death toll is 24, with relatives having confirmed six deaths on top of the 18 deaths officially listed by DFAT. We know that grave concerns remain for 10 Australians who were in tsunami affected areas and whose bodies have not been identified or are still subject to formal victim identification processes. As has been remarked by many speakers in this debate, the outpouring of generosity from Australians confronted with this tragedy was huge—huge at both the community and the official level. That is something for which Australia can be proud. All of us have stories of seeing people put in amounts of money that were probably almost beyond their capacity to donate at one time to one cause. But so moved were they that Australians were hugely generous in response to this tragedy. The Australian government, with the full support of the opposition, of course, announced a $1 billion program, the Australia-Indonesia partnership for reconstruction and redevelopment. It is a five-year commitment and the single largest aid package in Australia's history. We should be rightly proud of that as a country. </para><para>I would particularly like to direct my remarks to the work that was done in the health and medical area as an immediate response to the tsunami. Obviously, with a disaster like this there is not only dealing with the immediate loss of life but also dealing with people who are injured and the loss of critical infrastructure—such as that providing fresh water—and the consequences that has for the prospects of major disease outbreaks. Of course, one of the greatest risks facing the survivors of the tsunami was disease arising from the water or airborne diseases. The lack of fresh water and sanitation meant that outbreaks of communicable diseases such as cholera and typhoid were, rightly, very greatly feared as the next big killer after the devastation of the tsunami itself.</para><para>As recently as 4 February this year, the World Health Organisation has reported that there have been no outbreaks of disease in tsunami affected areas. That can be seen to be due to the unprecedented level of assistance from the world and from Australia to prevent that kind of catastrophe happening. Incidents of tetanus, measles and malaria have occurred but these appear to be controlled; the ability to react quickly has been crucial in ensuring their control. Australia has provided aid in the health and medical area to reduce risk. Particularly, we provided a water purification plant, capable of producing up to 480,000 litres of water a day, for distribution to the devastated communities in Banda Aceh. We also sourced and delivered 129,000 20-litre water containers to Banda Aceh to keep the supply of fresh water flowing.</para><para>There has been funding provided for a water and sanitation specialist to undertake an assessment and provide support for the provincial administration in addressing the immediate water supply and sanitation needs in Aceh. The World Health Organisation has formulated a mental health response for the people of Banda Aceh. Given the level of devastation in this region, the World Health Organisation is assessing mental health needs, training community leaders and ensuring the Aceh psychiatric hospital is equipped to deal with the longer-term effects of a disaster on this scale. Australia directly provided a 90-bed Australian Defence Force field hospital in Banda Aceh; funding for a team of 24 Australian doctors to provide urgent medical assistance; funding for a health assessment team, including specialists in health sector coordination, psychosocial support, child protection and infectious disease; and pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to Banda Aceh.</para><para>We have provided tetanus immunisation to treat and prevent the disease at the request of the World Health Organisation. We have provided medical supplies for the general hospital in Medan for the treatment of tsunami victims airlifted from Banda Aceh. We have provided support for re-establishing a procurement and medical supply distribution network in Banda Aceh and provided vital infrastructure and human resources for that purpose. We have supported the restoration of government mental health services by engaging a psychosocial trauma support specialist to undertake an assessment of the mental hospital and mental health needs more broadly in Banda Aceh. We have provided support for the restoration of government maternal health services by engaging a maternal health specialist, Kerry Ross, to conduct a rapid assessment of maternal health needs, focusing on midwife capacity, in the Aceh province. We have provided support for government engagement in infectious disease surveillance and control, and we have provided support for an infectious disease specialist from the Mentor, a malaria prevention non-government organisation which is now working on the issue of the malaria risk. </para><para>All of these things have been provided by Australia with Australian aid efforts. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate all of those who have been involved in providing these services. Efforts of such enormous dimension require not only people on the ground providing the services but coordination. Huge amounts of work and rapid responses are needed. Hundreds of people, possibly thousands, have been involved in these individual health and medical efforts that I have reported to the House today. Each of those individuals deserves our great congratulation.</para><para>Whilst we are very proud of the rapid response, we know that there are ongoing issues that we need to deal with as a result of the tsunami. Some of those are in the health and medical area. As we move from the wave of the tsunami and the devastation it left to the time beyond, one of the deepest concerns is the mental health needs of those who have survived. When people have had their lives destroyed, when they have lost loved ones, when they have perhaps lost all of their family, there is obviously a need for ongoing mental health assistance and support.</para><para>The second ongoing challenge for us is to ensure that we look after children's health and wellbeing. In the Banda Aceh camps, where about four million people live, about three per cent, or 120,000, are children younger than five. UNICEF has warned that 12.7 per cent of children surveyed at camps in and around the provincial capital of Banda Aceh suffer malnutrition, which stunts growth, retards mental development and weakens the immune system. UNICEF has warned that conditions could be even worse outside the provincial capital and calls the situation a `critical emergency' requiring immediate intervention. So, as we have responded to the immediate challenge, now the task is to respond to some of these longer term challenges in the areas of children's health and mental health and the physical rebuilding that is required across the region.</para><para>Other members have referred to particular contributions that people in their electorates have made to the aid effort. I would like to take the opportunity to do the same. In my local community there was an immediate response to the fundraising effort, as I am sure there was across Australia. The Hudson family of Werribee were holidaying in Phuket at the time of the tsunami. Luckily they all survived. The Hudson family are good mates of mine—notwithstanding the fact that I run into them every election day handing out Liberal how-to-vote cards—but I do not take it personally. They are good friends, and it was good to see them all return to Australia safe and well.</para><para>The Morris and Freeman families of Werribee, who were holidaying in Phuket, stayed to help with the clean-up. My electorate is home to many members of the Sri Lankan community in Melbourne and obviously they were particularly affected and particularly concerned about the fate of their family members. A Melton resident, Rozanne Short, who is a Sri Lankan community member, helped with fundraising efforts locally, particularly within the Sri Lankan community.</para><para>The Point Cook Residents Association have been involved in a pattern of providing ongoing assistance. They are going to have a fun run in March, a trivia night in June, a bike-a-thon in October and a Christmas twilight function in December. So they have dedicated their functions across the whole year to fundraising for the tsunami. Local Wyndham residents Justine Colley and Jacquie Cook have coordinated fundraising efforts in the Werribee area. The Hoppers Crossing Cricket Club had a special match against the Sri Lankan community on Australia Day. St Andrews Primary School sold pancakes on Pancake Tuesday, and the proceeds of that are going to tsunami victims. So the efforts across my community continue, and I am sure that they are going to continue across this year and hopefully beyond, because that is what is going to be required to ensure that we help rebuild our neighbours from this disaster. </para><para>Whilst I am on my feet can I take the opportunity to also pass on my condolences to those who were affected by the South Australian bushfires. As members of this House might know, whilst I am a proud Victorian now, representing a Victorian seat, I grew up in South Australia. My parents and sister lived—it was not our family home—for a lot of their lives in the hills area. When you have got family members who live in those parts of Adelaide you always worry about bushfires. I was particularly concerned about family members when we faced the horror of Ash Wednesday all those years ago. Knowing what it is like to live with that kind of apprehension, I did feel a particular emotional call when we saw the devastation that flowed from the bushfires on the Eyre Peninsula, killing nine people and causing about $50 million worth of damage. So I take the opportunity to record my condolences to the surviving family members of people who lost their lives, and also to those who have been affected economically and in other ways by what was a very big bushfire disaster, even by Australian standards—and we are a nation that knows about big bushfire disasters almost more than any other nation on earth.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>139</page.no><name role="metadata">Turnbull, Malcolm, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TURNBULL</name><name.id>885</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On 16 January after the terrible disaster of Boxing Day, there was a ceremony at North Bondi Surf Club at Bondi Beach. It was held in the ocean. A group of board-riders paddled out, formed a circle and cast a wreath into the ocean. It was a very poignant ceremony because of course nobody better understands than lifesavers the way in which the ocean not only entices us as a place to play and to sport ourselves in the sun but also is a very dangerous place. I think that might be why Australians have been so generous and have been filled with so much empathy and compassion for the victims of this disaster. Most of us live on the coast, most of us are very familiar with the sea and most of us recognise that as not only a place for enjoyment and a place for sport but also an element that can turn on you very quickly, be it a wave, a storm, a tide or, in this case, for the people of the Indian Ocean's rim, a gigantic tidal wave.</para></talk.start><para>I think we all recognise that these disasters can happen anywhere in the world. `There but for the grace of God go I' is a very important point. In Sydney Harbour there are giant sandstone boulders which were, geologists believe, thrown up over the cliffs, over the foreshore, into Sydney Harbour by giant waves. There is no reason to believe that the next tidal wave could not be hitting our shores or any part of it. It is hard to know—I am not a geologist, let alone a seismologist—but one has to ask why the big shift, the earthquake, that occurred off the coast of Tasmania did not itself create a tidal wave. Perhaps the next one will. Our hearts go out as humans. As the member for Flinders just said, we share a common humanity with all of the victims of this earthquake, as we do with the victims of all disasters. It is that humanity that ties us together all around the world, regardless of where we live. But we also share a special bond because of our understanding of the sea and our recognition of what the sea can do. </para><para>My wife and I had a very immediate connection with the disaster. A friend of ours who is a constituent of mine, a young woman called Cassie McGann, was staying in a place called Hikkaduwa in Sri Lanka. She rang my wife and left a message on Lucy's mobile phone. Her message went: `I'm sitting on a rooftop in Hikkaduwa. There's been an enormous wave and the waters are rising. Hundreds of people are dying. I don't know what's happened. I borrowed this phone from a French woman, but I think the battery is running out.' Then, indeed, it did run out and we heard no more from her. In the disaster we immediately thought, `How can we find her?' I have to say that the diplomats at the Australian High Commission in Colombo were outstanding. They were not just looking for her, of course; they were looking for all the Australians. But they immediately had teams of their staff going up and down that coast with vehicles, calling out, `Any Aussies? Any Brits? Anyone who speaks English? Are there any foreigners?' They were gathering them all together. Mercifully and miraculously, Cassie was found. She had managed to get to high ground, as, indeed, most Australians did.</para><para>It is genuinely a miracle that only a relatively small number of Australians have been killed. We miss every one of them; every one of them is a terrible loss. But, compared with the losses of other countries, including countries whose people in that region were mostly tourists, as ours were, our loss was very small. That underlines the great compassion and generosity of the Australian people. Of all the Western countries, we were probably the least affected in terms of people actually killed, and I suspect that is a function of the time of year. Most Australians who want to go to the beach on Boxing Day have a beach in Australia to go to rather than having to go to Thailand. That is not so if you are a Swede, a Norwegian or a German escaping from the frozen north. Notwithstanding that relatively small loss, tragic though it was, our contribution was greater per capita than any other country. I believe that great compassion and that generosity is because of the empathy we felt as a people who live mostly by the sea and are close to the sea and who do not turn our backs to the sea. As coast-living people we had a great and immediate empathy with that disaster, recognising its nature and recognising how it could have come to affect us.</para><para>The leadership shown by the Prime Minister and all his ministers has been outstanding, and I think it is wonderful to see such bipartisan endorsement for the government's leadership in the midst of this crisis. The Prime Minister's leadership was pre-eminent. He is the Prime Minister; it was his initiative to make this appropriately enormous pledge of aid to Indonesia, our nearest neighbour and the country that was worst hit. It is important to bear in mind, as the member for Flinders said, that no matter how good your warning system might have been no warning could have saved the people of Aceh. The earthquake was on their doorstep. Better warning systems are needed and will be put in place, and they certainly could have helped the people in Thailand, India, Sri Lanka and further afield. But if the earthquake is on your doorstep there will never be enough time.</para><para>The aid that has been given and the help that has been given by our defence forces and our public servants has been outstanding. I would also like to pay tribute to the outstanding work done by Alexander Downer, our foreign minister. Bruce Billson, the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs, is, in many respects, an unsung hero. He was everywhere around the region organising aid. I had many discussions with him because many of my constituents who had relevant experience wanted to assist with support. </para><para>One organisation in which I am involved—of which I am a director, in fact—is Clean Up Australia, headed by Ian Kiernan. It is the largest grassroots environmental organisation in Australia and famous for organising Clean Up Australia Day, which we are all familiar with. Clean Up Australia, which has a very important commitment to water purification and water recycling, immediately put in place measures which enabled it to deliver a great many small water purification devices—you could call them `plants' but they are really more like devices—to the damaged areas so that people in villages could quickly get clean drinking water again. Obviously, large water purification plants are only suitable in large centres where there is a considerable population, and in Indonesia, in particular, the population is very dispersed.</para><para>In my electorate, as in every electorate—I think every member and every senator in this parliament would have had the same experience—constituents were immediately generous. People were generous in accordance with their means, and some people gave beyond their means. In my own electorate there were extraordinary events. There was one dinner that my friends Michael and Judy McMahon organised at Catalina, a restaurant in Rose Bay, which raised $277,000 in one night—an extraordinary amount of generosity. There were similar events at other restaurants and clubs, and there were walks, bikeathons and so forth. There has been a massive outpouring of compassion across Australia and of course across my own electorate.</para><para>The question, I suppose, when we talk about compassion and the generosity of our community is: how can we ensure that this continues? A lot of people are asking the question: is this just a one-off event? I visited the international charity Caritas, which is the Catholic Church's international relief agency, the other day and met with its director, Jack de Groote. They have obviously been overwhelmed by the generosity. But there are of course many other disasters in other parts of the world which have not been as spectacular but where the need is just as great. Has this event opened up the compassion in our hearts not just for this occasion but to make us a more generous, more compassionate and more humane nation? I hope it has. I believe it has. But I think it will be up to all of us to ensure that that spirit of philanthropy, that spirit of giving, continues across the community.</para><para>We should of course remember the victims of the South Australian bushfire disaster, who were very much closer to home. Natural disasters occur in many shapes, in many forms and in many different places. None of us are exempt. The victims of that disaster suffered just as the victims of the earthquake in the Indian Ocean did, and they have rightly deserved our compassion, support and sympathy as well.</para><para>In terms of the future protection against earthquakes, we cannot proof ourselves against earthquakes. The power of the earth not only exceeds the ability of man to resist it but exceeds the ability of man to comprehend it. One of the important lessons from all of this, I believe, is the need to focus on the ability to respond to disasters quickly. Were it not for the Australian and United States armed forces, the people of Aceh would not have received the aid they received in as timely a fashion as they did. The massive infrastructure that is required to deliver aid to these areas at this stage in this region is largely in the hands of the United States. After the United States, our ability to do that would be second. It is a very important role for the defence forces. It is extraordinary, really, to see that the United States—whose image in parts of Indonesia and the region has perhaps not always been as high as it would like it to have been—because of that massive military presence, was singularly able to give the relief that it did to the people in that region. </para><para>We need to think more about the ability to deliver aid. I remember speaking with diplomats in Colombo, on the telephone obviously, after the earthquake. They made the point—and this was even more the case in Indonesia—that there simply was no infrastructure left. The roads had been destroyed. It was extremely hard to get aid into places which had been so damaged other than by ship or by air. By definition, your conventional infrastructure has been destroyed, so you need something else.</para><para>In summary, this has been a disaster almost beyond comprehension. However, it has brought out in the people of Australia not just great sympathy and great compassion but great deeds by many Australians in the defence forces and the public service and by our diplomats and our medical teams. Right down to the day-to-day level of ordinary Australians, people have felt the pain of our neighbours in the Indian Ocean, and they have done their best, be it with big cheques from corporations or wealthy individuals down to coins in buckets in shopping centres and in churches. In doing that, we have shown what we have always known but too often forget: that everybody around the world, all of us, are each other's brothers and sisters, and when any of us are hurt or when any of us are subject to a disaster then we all suffer. We relieve that suffering by showing our compassion and our generosity in the way we have done.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>142</page.no><name role="metadata">Livermore, Kirsten, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LIVERMORE</name><name.id>83A</name.id><electorate>Capricornia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I felt very strongly that I needed to speak on this motion.

Hopefully this is going to shape our world into the future as we meet the challenges that this disaster has presented to us.</para></talk.start><para>I got a sense of how the community was feeling when I attended a service at St Joseph's Cathedral, which is just a couple of blocks away from my house. Rockhampton's Churches Together group organised the remembrance service and put the call out to the community to come together to share our shock, our grief and our sense of solidarity and unity as human beings as we were confronted with the terrible images that were coming through the media, and the stories that people in our local community were connected to more directly from the disaster zone.</para><para>We met together at St Joseph's Cathedral, and one of the touches that was suggested—I believe it was by Bishop Brian Heenan from the Catholic Church—was for each person to bring a small tribute; not a wreath or a fancy bouquet that we can just ring up and order from the florist, but for each person or family to bring along a small tribute from their garden, something that meant something to them personally. It was quite moving to watch people from all walks of life from Central Queensland filing down the centre aisle of the cathedral and placing those floral tributes on the altar of the cathedral. Rockhampton is a very tropical place and of course there were hibiscus and frangipani and all the tropical flowers that are bursting out all over Queensland at the moment. More than anything else, that really spelled out to me the connection between the people of Central Queensland and the people in Thailand, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. We linked ourselves to that region through the image of those tropical flowers, because, of course, that is the environment our neighbours in the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia share with us as people of the tropics. That really brought home to me how my community was feeling and the importance of using this opportunity to express, on their behalf, their sympathy and feelings of solidarity with our neighbours who are trying to rebuild their lives after this terrible disaster. </para><para>Having said that I felt strongly that I should participate in this debate, I actually found it incredibly difficult to prepare for it because going through the news clippings and the speeches that have been made about this just brought it all back. It made me look again at the pictures of those orphaned children and the people who had lost everything. I also saw the joy that people with nothing material left in their lives felt when they found a loved one who they thought was missing. It really made me forget about being a member of parliament and respond to it as a human being. So, in trying to prepare for this, I really got lost in the enormity of it all—not just the scale of loss and the scale of the disaster but also the scale of the rebuilding effort that is going to be required by the international community as we help our neighbours in the Indian Ocean nations rebuild their countries, lives and communities.</para><para>It is one thing for me to relive it by flipping through some news clippings; it is another thing for the people who are actually living through this day by day—the people who have lost their homes, families and everything they know. This was really brought home to me when I attended the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum in Vietnam in the middle of January. Sitting around the table were representatives from Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia who were directly affected by this happening to their countries. The Indonesian delegation made a presentation on the first morning of the meeting. They had a video presentation that was the most graphic thing that I have seen in all the news coverage. This was an absolute fly-on-the-wall documentary, taken in what appeared to me to be real time, of people just sitting outside in Banda Aceh having breakfast in front of cafes, stopping to chat to neighbours—it was normal life happening in front of your eyes—and then all of a sudden there was water flowing down the streets. In the footage that I saw, it was quite innocuous—there was just this water coming. But then it kept coming, and all of a sudden it was not water anymore—it was a solid wall of debris sweeping everything in front of it. This idyllic scene of families talking, planning their mornings and eating their breakfast was swept away, both in reality in that location and metaphorically as that happened across a quarter of our world. It was so graphic and profound. The scale of the disaster was demonstrated to me by breaking it down to that very personal snapshot of what was happening in these people's lives as their whole world was swept away.</para><para>The point of all that is that, while it is hard for us to relive what happened, we have to keep reliving it, remembering it and understanding what is required to help these people get back on their feet. It was a situation where you could not change the channel; we were watching the video as part of the Indonesian presentation. As hard as it was and as horrific as it was, you could not change the channel. That is what we have to remember—the people in Thailand, Indonesia and Sri Lanka cannot change the channel. It is their life, and if it is their life then it is our life too.</para><para>The scale of the disaster was enormous but so was the scale of the response from Australia. I am incredibly proud of the $1 billion that the Australian government has provided and the leadership in the aid effort that we have shown as a country. There has also been a quarter of a billion dollars donated by ordinary people and corporations from around Australia. I pay tribute to the people in my electorate for the wonderful response they made. I do not think I have been to a community function since this happened where there has not been a raffle, tickets for a dinner or a street stall raising money and awareness of what is happening in these places, what is required to assist, and the importance of ongoing assistance to ensure that we do not forget what is needed to help these people. </para><para>I would also like to pay tribute to those people in my electorate who have gone to work as volunteers—the doctors, engineers and other aid workers who have gone over to these places to be confronted with incredible hardship and to work in a terribly testing environment. They are basically putting their comfortable lives, in many cases, on hold to help those most in need in our international community.</para><para>Although many members have said this, it is worth noting again: the open-heartedness and generosity demonstrated by the Australian people offer a new dawn in our relationship with Indonesia and our other neighbours. As I said, I was at the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum in Vietnam not long after the tsunami happened, and the sense of unity, the sense that we needed each other as a region and that we had an obligation to each other, was incredibly strong. It was great to be part of the goodwill between all the countries. There was a coming together as human beings and as representatives of our various countries to say, `We want to know what you need and we want to be there to help in the long term.' That is going to set the platform for such a strong relationship going forward not only with Indonesia but with our other near neighbours.</para><para>We need to take forward the lessons that come out of this. We have heard much technical detail about the need for an early warning system and the importance of Australia getting on board with that not only for our own safety and security into the future but also to assist the countries that stand to lose the most if a similar event happens in the future. We need to offer our expertise and financial assistance for those early warning systems.</para><para>We also need to respect the power of nature. We need to understand our world and the environmental challenges we face. We need to work in partnership with other countries to ensure that we do not put our heads in the sand, that we use this demonstration of how powerful and unstoppable these natural forces can be, and that we respect nature, the environment and the planet we live on. We must make sure we do everything we can to live within our natural boundaries as residents of this planet. That includes things like the Kyoto protocol and understanding the challenges facing the small island-states in our Pacific region and in other parts of the world. When we focus on what has happened in the current disaster, we must also understand the environmental disasters that might occur in the years ahead which could affect the people living on the Pacific islands and in other small island-states around the world. We must help them—and certainly not make things worse for them—and understand that we all have to shoulder our responsibility to other nations and other people around the world.</para><para>In my remarks to the APPF, I obviously expressed my condolences and also that sense of solidarity and desire to do everything we can. But I think the most important thing for us as we conclude this debate is to keep remembering, to make sure that we do not change the channel when it gets a bit confronting or go on to the next thing that comes along—to make sure that we are there for the long haul with our neighbours. As I said to the APPF meeting, right now we have this great sense that we have done our bit, but we have to make sure that next year, the year after and the year after that we can look our neighbours in the eye and know that we have continued to do everything we can to help them as they rebuild their lives. Australia has the capacity to do it—we have already shown that in the last month—but we need to make sure that we continue to do it and continue to build those bridges, both real and metaphorical, with our neighbours. Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the debate on this motion. The bipartisan spirit that has been demonstrated in this debate has been very instructive and shows how we can work together when it really counts. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>145</page.no><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr SOUTHCOTT</name><name.id>TK6</name.id><electorate>Boothby</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to associate myself with this motion, support it and support the remarks of the speakers who have preceded me. Boxing Day in Australia is normally a day we associate with family, recovering after perhaps overindulging on Christmas Day, having a holiday if we are not involved in essential services, the start of the Sydney Hobart Yacht Race or the start of the Melbourne cricket test. There are always positive associations with Boxing Day. But now, for our lifetimes, we will always remember it as the day that the tsunami struck a number of countries right around the Indian Ocean.</para></talk.start><para>It is estimated that almost 300,000 people have lost their lives. In Aceh and in Sri Lanka there are people who have lost 50 or 60 members of their extended families. There are couples who were separated—including, of course, many Australians, and we know about them. There are children who were lost. I remember one story of a woman who was holding two children and let go of the older child. Luckily that child was saved—but just to hear that as a parent and think about ever having to make that sort of choice!</para><para>The tsunami was the result of an earthquake just off the west coast of Aceh. It appears that there is increased activity of the plates just off that coast. There have been a number of tremors in that area in the last four or five years. So, while tsunamis are uncommon in recent history in the Indian Ocean region, we do have these plates, where one has slipped underneath the other one, and it seems that tremors are now fairly common. In recent times, the biggest tsunami in that area was of course the tsunami from the explosion of Krakatoa in the 1880s. I think that led to the deaths of about 30,000 people in Indonesia, but this one has been on a different scale.</para><para>Many of these deaths were preventable. The travel times between the epicentre of the earthquake and Sri Lanka and Chennai and so on were quite long. We are not talking minutes; we are talking hours. Many of these deaths were preventable. It is hoped that, just as the Pacific Ocean has a very well-monitored and well-organised tsunami warning system, the Indian Ocean will be able to have something too.</para><para>Just as we found after the bombings in Bali, the tsunami struck many areas that Australians are familiar with. Many Australian holidaymakers would be familiar with the west coast of Thailand, especially Phuket island, with Sri Lanka, with the Maldives and with the Seychelles. We have overseas students studying in Australia and past students who have returned to their countries from Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Thailand and Indonesia, including Aceh. A whole group of Acehnese students are studying in my own state at the University of South Australia.</para><para>For cricketers there were stadiums where they play test cricket, such as the stadium at Chennai, formerly Madras; and the stadium at Galle, where Shane Warne broke the record for the number of wickets taken in test cricket. There are many Australians with dual citizenship who have emigrated from these countries and who have families there. This was the largest natural disaster in the last 100 years and it affected an unprecedented number of countries. It affected their coastlines and so on, but it also affected an unprecedented number of nations and nationalities because of the Europeans who were holidaying in Sri Lanka and Thailand. These were tourist destinations, so it affected the whole world. </para><para>We saw unexpected heroes—the young Australians in Sri Lanka and Thailand, who had some training as nurses, doctors or whatever, who interrupted their holidays to go and do what they could, without many supplies and so on, to help their fellow human beings. There was a young British girl in India, who was about 10 years old, who had learnt in her class that when the water recedes it means there is going to be a Tsunami. She warned people on her beach when she saw this happening and was able to save the lives of hundreds.</para><para>The response to the tsunami I think showed Australia at its best. I was very proud of the response from the Australian government. I was very proud of the response from the Australian public. I was very proud of the response from those who were there who did what they could. Our military personnel are trained to adapt and they are up there now providing food, fresh water, medical supplies and a 90-bed hospital. The HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline> is there with 250 sailors and 150 engineers. In times of tragedy we do find heroes. Peter Cosgrove became known to us through East Timor. The Australian of the Year became known to us as a burns surgeon in Bali. We now have people like Colonel Georgina Whelan, a military surgeon.</para><para>We have sent five civilian medical teams. Many of those on the civilian medical teams from South Australia I know well—I worked and trained with them. Many of those people are enormously experienced. They have been to the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Bougainville, East Timor and so on. I met some of them last weekend and spoke to them about the work they did in cleaning up the hospital in Banda Aceh. They were given an incredibly tough job which involved cleaning up the hospital, removing bodies and so on, but they did it and they did it well. As a result of that, through the public face of Australia in Aceh—our military, our civilian medical teams and so on—we have earned enormous goodwill. We saw the Australian Public Service at its best. There was a really coordinated response right across government.</para><para>For the National Day of Mourning and Reflection last January I was able to attend a service at the Somerton Park Baptist Church and later a multifaith service at St Peter's Anglican Cathedral, which was really moving and involved Hindu, Thai, Muslim and Christian representatives. Later this month I will be going to a dinner to raise funds for people in India and Sri Lanka at the Hindu temple in Oaklands Park, in my electorate.</para><para>As part of this response we have announced $1 billion to Indonesia over five years. I am very proud that we have announced this. It is very important in the administration of this that we do not lose the goodwill that our volunteers have gained in Indonesia. This money will attract all sorts of carpetbaggers and it is really important that we attract people who are working with goodwill and working to advance the way in which Australia is seen in this area. We have had something like 6,000 medical personnel register to volunteer in a tsunami area, and I think that is great. But I am concerned that we may see, with this, people who may lose us some of the goodwill that we have.</para><para>I would like to conclude by paying tribute to a constituent of mine who was visiting Sri Lanka when the tsunami struck. He was Sujeewa Kamalasuriya, a 39-year-old Adelaide businessman. He was originally from Sri Lanka and he moved to Australia in 1990. He lived in my electorate of Boothby in Melrose Park, and he became an Australian citizen about five years ago. He ran an Adelaide cleaning business. He was a keen cricketer—he represented Sri Lanka at the under-19 level and he played with the Adelaide High Old Scholars. He was snorkelling off Unawatuna Beach, south of Colombo, when the tsunami struck. His business partner, Sarah Roberts, was rescued but he unfortunately drowned. His body was later recovered and there was a funeral held in Adelaide in January. I would like to again give my condolences to all those who lost friends or family in the tsunami, especially to the friends and family of my constituent Sujeewa Kamalasuriya. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>147</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the House for the opportunity in this place to recognise the enormous loss of life in South-East Asia and to come together as a parliament in support of the devastated communities across the region.

The briefing was conducted by Professor Ian Webster, Chair of the AER Foundation. AER stands for alcohol education and rehabilitation. The foundation is an independent company that was set up in 2001 with a grant from the Australian government. Its charter is to enhance the capacity of the alcohol and other drugs sector to address alcohol and other illicit substance abuse and to promote the responsible consumption of alcohol.</para></talk.start><para>Qualitative research was carried out for AER by Quantum Market Research, and interviews were conducted in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia with people 16 years and over. Mr Daryl Smeaton, CEO of the AER Foundation, highlighted the fact that:</para><quote><para>... alcohol is a `sacred cow' in Australia. It is an intrinsic part of our social fabric with people reporting a gentle pressure to drink and that choosing not to drink can be confronting for those who do.</para></quote><para>Daryl Smeaton goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Individuals describe a reluctance to challenge people who are drinking to excess; the right to drink alcohol is linked to an individual's freedom.</para></quote><para>The research shows that here in Australia we have a huge problem caused by alcohol misuse, a problem that is increasing in severity and one which receives very little real funding compared with the massive amount of federal funding spent targeting illicit drug users. No other social problems result in such widespread harm to so many Australians. It is a fact that impulsive behaviour caused by excessive use of alcohol is a major factor in the following: 70 to 80 per cent of night-time assaults, 50 per cent of domestic and sexual violence, 50 per cent of deaths from assault, 44 per cent of deaths from fires, 35 per cent of industrial accidents, 34 per cent of deaths from falls and drowning, 30 per cent of all road deaths, 16 per cent of child abuse deaths and 12 per cent of suicides.</para><para>What do these percentages mean in reality? It is hard to believe that every year in Australia alcohol misuse contributes to around 3,500 deaths, the majority being avoidable accidents. A further 95,000 Australians are hospitalised. And what is the estimated financial cost of the problem to Australian society? A staggering $7.5 billion, and each and every one of us suffers that burden of harm. Australians need to be shaken awake from their apathy and confront the crisis that is affecting every aspect of our entire community.</para><para>And why do I say we have a crisis? The research highlights some frightening findings. I mentioned at the start of my speech that in Australian culture there is an acceptance that getting drunk is part of the Australian way of life. Drinking alcohol is seen as a rite of passage into adulthood. The frightening research findings are: nearly half of the respondents believed that getting drunk is an acceptable part of the Australian way of life; one in three believed that binge drinking is okay and that it is only a problem if you do it all the time; one in five believed binge drinking is okay as long as you do not embarrass yourself; one-third said it is okay to drink to excess at home or on special celebrations such as birthdays and anniversaries; and 21 per cent felt that you should not tell another person how much is too much when it comes to drinking. It is frightening, because there seems to be an acceptance of these beliefs. </para><para>Society accepts—nay, condones and encourages—its young people to become part of this binge-drinking culture. Remember what happens in schoolies weeks in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. Next week, across Australia, during orientation week at our universities we will see a week of alcohol abuse and alcohol excess.</para><para>Having a bronzed suntan used to be part of being Australian. However, the threat of skin cancer and the Slip, Slop, Slap campaign motivated more and more reasonable behaviour. If Australia can achieve a cultural shift away from the bronzed Aussie image where skin cancer incidences are reducing, then why, oh why, can't we do it with binge drinking?</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Flinders Electorate: Rural Support and Telecommunications Services</title><page.no>149</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>149</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to take this opportunity to announce a series of rural services which will assist the seat of Flinders and residents throughout Bass Coast, Westernport and the Mornington Peninsula, primarily in the area of rural support services and improved telecommunications services. I want to congratulate those individuals and community groups that have fought hard for these services.</para></talk.start><para>My first announcement is about the Grantville rural transaction centre. I am delighted to inform the House that the Grantville rural transaction centre will officially open on 19 March 2005. One month from now we will see a new centre opening on the main highway which will provide a range of new and enhanced services: (1) it will provide local government services (2) it will be a Centrelink access point (3) it will have Medicare Easy Claim facilities and (4) most important of all the different facilities, the Grantville transaction centre will include medical rooms. Already, thanks to the work of Bass Coast Shire Council, particularly Councillor John Hulley, who has done a tremendous job, and Helen Padalini, also from the Bass Coast Shire Council, there will be a doctor who will visit there on a part-time basis. That is a tremendous outcome and a great result for the towns of Corinella, Coronet Bay, Glen Forbes, Kernot, Almurta and, of course, Grantville and the town of Bass itself. On 19 March, along with a series of other facilities which come with it, the Bass Coast Shire Grantville rural transaction centre will be opened. That is great step forward. I want to congratulate all those involved—in particular, the community, led by Councillor John Hulley and Helen Padalini, and the broader community in general.</para><para>My next announcement concerns a series of mobile and broadband telephony services which have been increased or will be increased across Flinders. In relation to mobile phone coverage, Optus has installed 10 new mobile sites over the past two years. Significantly, it plans to improve mobile coverage within the seat of Flinders in at least eight areas over the coming two years in Blairgowrie Beach, Rye, central Rosebud, east Rosebud, the Osborne area of Mount Martha, central Moorooduc, Tooradin and north Lang Lang. There will be improved mobile phone coverage from Optus in all those areas. Similarly—and this is one of the benefits of competition—Telstra has increased and will increase both its broadband and its mobile coverage throughout the Mornington Peninsula and Westernport areas. It has done so over the last few years and will do so in the coming few years. Broadband—and I am delighted to say this—has recently been extended to Crib Point, Fingal, Flinders, Pearcedale, Shoreham, Warneet, Tyabb and Devon Meadows. Over the coming 16 months broadband is planned for Koo Wee Rup, Grantville, Corinella, Main Ridge, Red Hill, Tooradin, Newhaven and San Remo. All of those areas will have increased broadband services. I am delighted with the result and pleased to have been able to work with the community on those outcomes in each of those areas. </para><para>In addition to that, mobile coverage has already been extended in Ventnor, Anderson, Newhaven, Hastings, Cranbourne, Tooradin, Blairgowrie and Sorrento and will be extended to Rosebud, Cranbourne and Balnarring. Hopefully, it will also be extended to Shoreham, Boneo, Moondah Beach and other areas on the Mornington Peninsula. Taken together, that is a tremendous set of initiatives. I believe that we have made real progress. Something as simple as a payphone can make a difference to those who can neither afford nor have access to telephony within their own homes. There will be four new installations in our area that will be completed in the next 18 months. They include a new payphone for Eramosa Road in Somerville, Josephine Avenue in west Cranbourne, Point Nepean Road in Rosebud and also Mathis Avenue in Tootgarook, amongst others. Telecommunications and medical services are critical. On both of those fronts we are making tremendous progress. I am delighted to inform the House of this, and I thank the community. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Communications: The Ashes</title><page.no>150</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>150</page.no><name role="metadata">Livermore, Kirsten, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LIVERMORE</name><name.id>83A</name.id><electorate>Capricornia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to add my support to the growing number of calls for the upcoming Ashes series to be broadcast on free-to-air television. I am sure we all have stories from our families about our fathers or grandfathers sitting there wrapped up in a blankets on a cold winter's night in front of the old radiogram listening to the broadcasts of the Ashes tours of England in the fifties and sixties. In my family there is a story of my dad falling asleep on the floor listening to the test cricket coverage in the middle of the night. I suspect there are a number of members of this chamber who have similar memories of their introduction to Ashes cricket.</para></talk.start><para>The government needs to act, and act now, if it is to preserve those experiences in the lives of our current generation of young cricket fans. The government has itself acknowledged the importance of events like the Ashes test series to our sense of national identity and pride by including them in the antisiphoning scheme set up in the Broadcasting Services Act. The purpose of the scheme, we are told, is to protect the access of Australian viewers to events of national importance and cultural significance on free-to-air television by preventing pay TV operators from siphoning off television coverage of those events before free-to-air broadcasters have an opportunity to obtain broadcasting rights.</para><para>The problem is that the upcoming Ashes series has fallen through the gaps in the government's antisiphoning scheme and at this stage will only be seen by the 25 per cent of Australians who have access to pay TV. So far the government has adopted a hands-off approach which is totally indifferent to the concerns of ordinary sports fans in my electorate. For example, in answer to a question in the Senate on 18 November last year the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts said:</para><quote><para>The acquisition of broadcast rights is, I am sure all would agree, a commercial decision for the relevant broadcasters.</para></quote><para>The minister went on to say:</para><quote><para>Ultimately, the government would not as a matter of principle dictate day-to-day decisions on programming which are taken by either the national or commercial broadcasters.</para></quote><para>We are not asking the minister to do the networks' job for them, but we are asking the minister to do her job—that is, to protect the interests of the average Australian viewer like those in my electorate. The truth is that Channel 9 has grabbed so many exclusive rights to major sporting events that it cannot do justice to any of them. We have seen a fall in attendances at football matches and cricket matches because the public is not given enough coverage to maintain the public interest in these sports. Now with the Ashes we see the true damage done to our Australian way of life as this government allows our great sporting tradition to be used for profit by a few media moguls. </para><para>Last year, for example, my constituents complained that they were not able to see their favourite AFL team on free-to-air television. They did not understand why they had to give up their Friday night indoor bowls or other activities if they wanted to see their rugby league match of the round. You have to ask yourself: who decided to move the rugby league games? Who decided that Channel 9 would not take this year's Ashes tour? Who decided that regional Queenslanders could only watch Aussie rules after 11 p.m.? Of course it is the same people who stand to gain the most by forcing sports fans onto pay TV. Once again we see regional Australians suffering as this government does everything it can to give Mr Murdoch and Mr Packer everything they want.</para><para>At the moment the ABC are the only ones in there having a go. The ABC are negotiating over broadcast rights for the Ashes with the England and Wales Cricket Board, but they need help from the government to give them the best possible chance of securing free-to-air broadcast rights. In the Senate estimates hearings earlier this week Mr Russell Balding explained that the ABC could be assisted by the minister keeping the Ashes tour on the antisiphoning list—and not accede to the request by the English cricket board to de-list the Ashes series—and would like the parliament to consider lifting the genre restrictions on the ABC's second digital channel. Of course the ALP has gotten behind that call and is asking the minister to do those things to give the ABC the best chance possible of broadcasting the Ashes. The people of Central Queensland have had enough. They demand that this government does whatever is necessary to ensure the 2005 Ashes series is broadcast live and free to air for all Australians. Otherwise it will no longer be a question of the game never being the same but rather that the game will simple cease to be.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Human Rights in Darfur</title><page.no>151</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>151</page.no><name role="metadata">Laming, Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAMING</name><name.id>E0H</name.id><electorate>Bowman</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I acknowledge the member for Capricornia, who joins a long list of people from the opposition speaking about antisiphoning but coming up with simply no concrete solution to coverage of the Ashes series, except suggesting that somebody steps in or we protect the interest of Australian viewers.

Just eight years ago damage to the Australian way of life was no jobs, inflation, interest rates, collapsing businesses and no hope for ordinary Australians, and now damage to the Australian way of life is not having coverage of the Ashes series locked in a few weeks before the first test.</para></talk.start><para>I rise to continue my remarks from Monday on the ongoing humanitarian and human rights crisis in Darfur in Western Sudan. I am driven to make these comments because of my time on the Sudanese border just one month ago at a time when President Mubarak was announcing a package of aid and economic cooperation from Egypt for Sudan. It is of great concern to me that within that country, as one examines the current situation in Darfur, we are seeing shades of Rwanda—the great lesson in public policy of the last century about inaction and indecisiveness. Those atrocities in Rwanda ring loudly in the ears of anyone who was involved in international aid and reconstruction over the last decade. </para><para>The causes of this particular conflict are unique, but they have a familiar pattern. Competition back in the 1980s between the nomadic and mainly northern Arabic populations and the more stable grazing and farmland communities further south has led to an administrative system heavily biased in favour of the Arabic tribes, who control 19 of the 24 administrative areas. The Khartoum government has supported that and discriminated against and marginalised the African communities by providing support to the Janjaweed to suppress the non-Arab populations. Janjaweed is a colloquial expression which means `man with a gun on a horse'. These militiamen are primarily members of a nomadic Arab tribe who have lighter skin than their African counterparts.</para><para>Earlier this month, the United Nations special inquiry found that attacks by the Janjaweed militia were occurring with the acquiescence of state officials, and that is the problem: the notion of state sovereignty and whether we can intervene in situations like this. It flows on from 18 September 2004, when the United Nations Security Council passed resolution 1594 establishing a commission of inquiry and raising the possibility of sanctions against Sudan if it did not act to stop attacks against civilians and allow humanitarian agencies to do their good work without hindrance.</para><para>Jan Pronk, the UN's special representative, commented in his report that the el-Bashir government had failed to stop the Janjaweed. According to that report—and, again, doesn't this sound like Rwanda or echoes of the Congo, where there have been 70,000 deaths each and every year for two decades—there has been indiscriminate and widespread killing and bombing of civilians; the forcible transfer of 1.85 million Darfur civilians; the creation of 1.65 million internally displaced persons, with over 200,000 refugees fleeing across the border to Chad; the destruction of 2,000 villages and hamlets; the systematic perpetration of rape and violence, including abduction, torture and gang rape of women and girls; the plundering and looting of civilian property; the torture and inhumane treatment of civilians—and the list goes on.</para><para>The Australian government wrote to the President of the United Nations Security Council on 28 January this year, urging action to prevent further violence in Darfur. The Australian government has called for the introduction of targeted measures, such as individual travel bans and asset seizures, to bring pressure to bear on the parties. We know that these are important steps but of limited impact unless they are coordinated through the UN. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has already indicated that, if requested by the United Nations, Australia would consider sending assistance or a small peacekeeping force.</para><para>I commend the Australian government, and I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his continued support of humanitarian efforts in Darfur and for urging a cessation of violence. It is clear from those actions of Minister Downer that the Australian government is committed to supporting those international efforts fully to end this appalling tragedy. The echo of Rwanda in our ears is heard still and also that famous comment of our former foreign minister that there is no peacekeeping possible when there is no peace to keep—and I hope I have paraphrased him correctly. We must build consensus. We must ensure that we act before it is too late. Africa's ethnic and tribal disputes must not be considered as a matter of national sovereignty and ignored. The spill-over effect to other economies is substantial. The instability that leads to erosion and loss of physical, financial, human and social capital is enormous. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act</title><page.no>153</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>153</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to speak about the effects of section 21 of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and in particular about its effects and the unreasonable hardship it is causing to one of my constituents, Ian Emery, and his family, and to many other former public servants. Changes were made in 2001 to ensure that all federal public servants on compensation received 75 per cent of their former salary. The level of 75 per cent was promoted in the compensation scheme's charter. The changes to section 21 of the above act ensured that all federal public servants who remained on ongoing compensation payments received that amount of former salary. These changes fail to include Mr Emery or the cohort group that he belongs to of some 1,500 former public servants, some of whom are receiving as little as 40 per cent of former salary. Mr Emery received a voluntary redundancy package and remains on ongoing compensation payments because Comcare's support for invalidity and retirement was not accepted by the retirement benefits office.</para></talk.start><para>While sections 19, 20 and 21 under the SRC Act were originally introduced to avoid double-dipping—prior to 1988 officers were actually entitled to receive payments both from ComSuper and Comcare—it was at no time the intention of the original legislation to create further disadvantage to those falling within the provisions of sections 19, 20 and 21. Mr Emery's financial hardship is further compounded by the reduction of his wife's parenting allowance by some 80 per cent as a result of the CPI increases that Mr Emery is paid. It reduces his wife's payment by 50 per cent on each increase. This has effectively reduced Mrs Emery's parenting allowance from $370 to just $70 per fortnight.</para><para>The two areas of concern under the SRC Act which I would like to draw to the attention of the House are as follows: firstly, the deeming provisions for lump sum superannuation payments and, secondly, the discounting of the weekly compensation payments by five per cent to take account of the amount that the employees are required to pay as a compulsory contribution to superannuation. The only explanation for this deduction offered by Department of Employment and Workplace Relations is stated in their training manual—that is, `because it came out before'. It is simply that. There is no other reason. Just because it happened in the past, it continues to happen now.</para><para>Under section 21 of the SRC Act the deeming provisions for lump sum superannuation payments prescribe the application of a notional rate of 10 per cent per annum. Provisions apply when a person in receipt of compensation exits from employment under voluntary redundancy provisions and takes superannuation entitlements as a lump sum. To determine the notional weekly value of the superannuation lump sum benefit, it is divided by 520. This divisor assumes that over the long-term period invested at 10 per cent there will be a certain specific return. This rate was set in 1988 when interest rates were much higher. A former employee in receipt of both a compensation related payment and a lump sum has the amount of weekly payments reduced by the method set out, which I have just explained. Each year, therefore, it is assumed that the superannuation lump sum is generating an earning rate of 10 per cent. The fortnightly compensation payment, under the SRC Act, is reduced accordingly. Hence the inequality in what is taking place today.</para><para>For the past 10 years, Mr Emery's lump sum payment has been deemed with 11 per cent, which means a fortnightly deduction of $542 from his compensation payment. This has resulted in the recovery by the federal government of more than the total amount of $141,000 that Mr Emery had originally received in his voluntary redundancy package in 1994. Mr Emery's case is a special case, as he and his wife and three young children are not only financially affected by the impact of section 21 but his wife's parenting allowance is also reduced by more than $300 per fortnight. I am sure members everywhere in this House can understand the extreme hardship that this person and his family are suffering, along with 1,500 other former public servants who are treated in a very inequitable way by the provisions under this act, which can be fixed. It was never the intention of this act to do this to people. </para><para>For employees who continue to work, the five per cent deduction from their salary accumulates a benefit which is repaid as a lump sum plus earnings on retirement. In contrast, the five per cent deduction is lost to Mr Emery forever, which is contrary to the intention of the current legislation. The intention of this superannuation deduction is clearly spelt out in Comcare's letter to the Superannuated Commonwealth Officers' Association Federal Council dated 18 March 2002, which states that the deduction is meant to continue a benefit. It does not in Mr Emery's case or in the cases of those other people it affects.</para><para>The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations appears to have failed to recognise this fact. I have written to them, I have written to the minister and I will continue to pursue this injustice until this area is fixed. The situation can easily be remedied in three ways: first, by adjusting the 10 per cent deeming rate to deeming rates used by other government departments; second, by either stopping the practice of discounting weekly compensation payments by five per cent or placing contributions into the fund that accrues the benefit; and, third, by immediately supporting an act of grace support for superannuation deductions made for those no longer in the fund. I believe, as I believe all other members in this place would, that we need to make this right, because it is hurting people. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Herbert Electorate: James Cook University</title><page.no>154</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>154</page.no><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name><name.id>HK6</name.id><electorate>Herbert</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to say that James Cook University in North Queensland has done it again. James Cook is arguably now the leading regional university in Australia. Headquartered in Townsville, under the leadership of Vice-Chancellor Bernard Moulden, the university has powered ahead. Next week, after the conclusion of orientation week, university studies will begin and degrees in rehabilitation sciences will be available at James Cook for the first time. I am very pleased to say that the federal government has contributed significantly to these new degrees through the provision of some $6 million in capital to build a new rehabilitation sciences building.</para></talk.start><para>The building is state of the art. It will provide the best facilities of its type in Australia out of any of the universities in this country. It is a credit to James Cook University and to executive dean Professor Ian Wronski in what they have been able to achieve in the area of rehabilitation sciences. Many university buildings are just a set of walls and some windows; this building has been designed for the tropics and as a pleasant workspace. More than that, senior staff have been to other universities to take all of the best ideas and incorporate them in the new facility at James Cook. When the students enter the building next Monday, they are going to be delighted. The students themselves have voted with their applications. For every place that was available in the new courses, there were nine applicants. That is incredible and it is a great tribute to James Cook that students want to attend its rehabilitation sciences courses. </para><para>The new courses are integral to further developing high-quality tertiary education in North Queensland. Until now, students wishing to do degrees in rehabilitation sciences have had to go to Brisbane for their courses. I believe, as the university believes, that students who study locally will remain locally. It is particularly important in regional Australia that we have our fair share of scientists and practitioners to make sure that our community is properly serviced.</para><para>The degrees in physiotherapy and speech therapy came in response to the shortage of allied health professionals in Queensland, particularly in rural regions. The expansion of JCU's health and rehabilitation sciences degree has brought an extra 200 students to JCU. The degree headquarters will house a state-of-the-art sports performance measurement facility—the first of its kind outside a major Australian metropolitan centre.</para><para>But that is not all; James Cook has recognised there is more to do. We are already looking to the future, and in the next university year, starting in 2006, a new veterinary science course will begin. This will also be part of the health precinct that has been built at JCU. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you may say: why is veterinary science of interest in the health precinct? What it will be looking at and specialising in is the transfer of diseases in animals to humans, known scientifically as the process of zoonosis. We will see a tropical university looking at these sorts of things through a new vet science degree.</para><para>Then there is the tropical sciences research precinct which will be established. About $80 million will go into that. It is very exciting because it will be part of a collaboration and co-location with the reef CRC, Marine Science, CSIRO, the DPR&amp;F, BSES and so on. It is very exciting. In 10 years we will see James Cook in the top five research universities in the world for tropical sciences. It is a tremendous achievement from a university that in 1997 did not know how it was going to pay its salaries for the next week. Congratulations to James Cook University and its leadership. You have done well and you are going to do even better.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></maincomm.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions in Writing</type><title>QUESTIONS IN WRITING</title><page.no>156</page.no></debateinfo><para></para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Gambling</title><page.no>156</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 20)</subtitle><id.no>20</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>156</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Murphy</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 17 November 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Can the Minister confirm that unregulated foreign betting exchanges are using their websites to actively target Australians with sports and race betting products in competition with legal wagering offered by Australian companies thus depriving the Federal Treasury of GST revenue and the states and community groups of gambling tax.</para><para>(2)	Can the Minister confirm that one of the organisations involved in this new form of internet gambling, Betfair, now has a senior executive permanently stationed in Australia to directly promote this service to Australian gamblers.</para><para>(3)	Is it the case that unregulated betting exchanges allow multiple real-time bets on virtually any sport and any outcome; if so, does this development have the potential to increase problem gambling and corruption in sport.</para><para>(4)	Can the Minister confirm that in the UK, where betting exchanges originated, gambling activity has increased dramatically resulting in the British Racing Authority asking the UK Government to conduct a Royal Commission into the activities of betting exchanges.</para><para>(5)	Why has the Government not acted to crack down on the foreign betting exchanges.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>156</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McGauran</name><name.id>XH4</name.id><electorate>Gippsland</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Interactive wagering and lotteries are not prohibited under the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 (IGA).

The University did not inform me of its decision to suspend the 2005 intake into these courses prior to the announcements reported in the press. I cannot, therefore, confirm that it announced its decision on 18 November 2004 or if it consulted or notified its staff or students of the decision. I am, however, concerned about this matter and the way in which the University appears to have informed applicants. I wrote to the vice-chancellor, Professor Janice Reid, on 8 December 2004 expressing my concerns. I have also decided to include a clause in Funding Agreements from next year that will require all universities to negotiate with my Department before closing specialist courses such as these.</para><para>	The University has a notice on its website informing students that they can change their preferences with UAC at no charge if they wish to undertake an alternative course at UWS. Students had until 6 January 2005 to change their preferences to other UWS courses.</para><para>(4)	The University has said that it was not closing the courses but suspending the 2005 and 2006 intakes in order to undertake a course review. The suspension of these courses for those two years, however, may have an impact on the osteopathic and podiatric professions and the Australian Government is concerned about the possible outcomes of this move. I also note that representatives from the professions have expressed their concerns regarding the impact the suspensions will have on the future needs of the community.</para><para>(5)	Enrolment procedures are a matter for the University and the Universities Admission Centre (UAC). UWS informed students on its web site that they could change their preferences with the UAC at no charge if they wished to undertake any of the alternative courses suggested by UWS.</para><para>(6)	My Department will be monitoring this situation and will discuss this issue with the University in the next round of Funding Agreement negotiations. </para><para>(7)	My Department is developing a set of strategic principles for higher education priorities that will guide a national strategic approach to higher education provision across universities and help ensure the protection of national priorities. The principles will help inform the Government in how disciplines designated as national priority areas may be supported.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet: Domestic and Overseas Travel</title><page.no>172</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 326)</subtitle><id.no>326</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>172</page.no><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Quick</name><name.id>AV5</name.id><electorate>Franklin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 6 December 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	For the year 2003-2004, what sum was spent by the Minister's department on (a) domestic, and (b) overseas air travel.</para><para>(2)	For the year 2003-2004, what proportion of domestic air travel by employees of the Minister's department was provided by (a) Qantas, (b) Regional Express, and (c) Virgin Blue.</para><para>(3)	For the year 2003-2004, what was the actual expenditure by the Minister's department on domestic air travel provided by (a) Qantas, (b) Regional Express, and (c) Virgin Blue.</para><para>(4)	For the year 2003-2004, what sum was spent by the Minister's department on business class travel on (a) domestic routes, and (b) overseas routes.</para><para>(5)	For the year 2003-2004, what sum was spent by the Minister's department on economy class travel on (a) domestic routes, and (b) overseas routes.</para><para>(6)	For the year 2003-2004, what proportion of the expenditure on air travel by the Minister's department was on the domestic routes (a) Sydney to Canberra, (b) Melbourne to Canberra, (c) Sydney to Melbourne, (d) Sydney to Brisbane, (e) Melbourne to Hobart or Launceston, and (f) Sydney to Perth.</para><para>(7)	For the year 2003-2004, how many employees of the Minister's department had membership of the (a) Qantas Chairman's Lounge, (b) Qantas Club, (c) Regional Express Membership Lounge, and (d) Virgin Blue's Blue Room paid for by the department.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>172</page.no><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Howard</name><name.id>ZD4</name.id><electorate>Bennelong</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>I am advised by my department that;
